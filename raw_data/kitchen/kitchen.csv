0,"false advertising. Although the &quot;technical data&quot; said this pot is safe for the stovetop, when it arrived, its own literature said very clearly that it is NOT safe for stovetop use. The only reason I ordered it was because I wanted something I could move from stovetop to oven or broiler. THis is very disappointing",1
1,Missing parts. Recived one filter not two as advertized.  I will not do transactions with this vender again,1
2,"Just say no. Amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on Amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered. We hoped this one would be an exception. It was, but only in that it may be the poorest of them all. Ours buzzed loudly whenever in use. Never had a toaster buzz before. We toast bread at least twice a day, and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible. It has no bagel setting (which toasts the cut side more than the crust side), so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast. What's more, it toasts completely unevenly. One corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned. And it's really annoying when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently. As far as looks go, De'Longhi did just as bad a job. The photos look cool, but the crumb tray this unit ""sits"" upon is actually wider than the unit itself, so there is a big uneven gap at the seam. It's the lower line you see in the photos--but they make it look real nice for that! What you don't see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several MM from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown. This makes it look broken, like two pieces of something that no longer fit together. If De'Longhi had spent even a second thinking about this, they would have done the opposite: The bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit, which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look. (We even went to a store [yes, a real store] to confirm that they are all like this, and they are.) Also, the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element. There are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn't scratch the metal surface of the toaster. However, two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping, and though they slipped right back in, all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out (only friction holds them in) and you WILL loose them very quickly--especially if you ever wash the rack. We're happy to pay extra for a quality item--even a toaster--but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment. Final advice: Stick to the $20 toasters with functions such as bagel, defrost, and dual controls. If it's ugly, keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it. This one looks broken, performs poorly, and costs a lot of money. If you do buy this model, maybe you'll get ours...we returned it",1

8,"Not so safe... I bought six of these collars for my five cats. (I bought an extra just in case one of the cats lost one.) I thought the colors were great, and I was happy with the idea of the material, as opposed to cheap vynil. They do look fashionable, I think, and are discreet enough to not take away from the beauty of the cat itself. However, these collars are NOT ""breakaway"" collars. They enlarge if they get caught on something, but this actually only adds its own problems. Several times my cats came home with one leg through the collar (and the collar extended as far as possible). I hated to think what would have happened if the cat had gotten the collar caught on something AFTER getting the leg stuck. One cat finally did come home without his, and I didn't replace it. Another came home with the collar around her chest (both front legs had gone through), and it was constricting her. I pulled to try to get it off, but it was obviously very painful, and in the end the only solution was for me to cut it off. I decided these collars are not very safe after all--too bad I bought six at once (the reviews at the time were pretty good, generally). I've taken them all off, and now my daughters can play with them on their stuffed animals. They look do look cute! I just don't trust them on live animals.",1
9,"Very Poor Quality Vacuum. This vacuum worked for about 2-minutes before the brushes stop turning.  I took this to a authorized Hoover vacuum dealer to look at. After finding the problem was some bent pole that supported the brushes to work, they contacted Hoover only to find out there is a recall out for this vacuum cleaner model and the part was not available yet for the repair.  So after purchasing this vacuum on February 1st, 2007, the vacuum is still at the repair shop 1-month later.  Part is still not available. Stay away from purchasing this vacuum.  I only kept it since Amazon.com charges you a re-stocking fee on open merchandise.Lyle....St.Louis, M",1

13,"Nice idea, but that's all. The dispenser is in the kitchen and it dispenses soap sporadically for no apparent reason.  This happens frequently during the day and night.  It happens whether someone is in the kitchen or not.  It makes a noise when the soap is being dispensed so we can hear it from the next room.  I had to put a small bowl in front of the dispenser to catch the soap, which defeats the purpose",1

16,"Not a real tagine: it only looks like one. A real tagine in Morocco has a hole at the top for the steam to escape.  This has NO Hole and therefore cooks like a dutch oven.  The chicken will literally boil to death and drown.  The product is made in Thailand, says so on the box, and is so hot after a half an hour that you can not touch any part of it, unlike it's claim.  This product to me, having been served a chicken tagine for over a month in Morocco, is culinary fraud.  And the price is highway robbery. I do not recommend buying this product at all",1
17,"terrible quality; a really unfortunate purchase. Two years ago, I purchased this hand-crank ice cream freezer for $130 on the web. My wife and I loved the idea of kids taking turns cranking the handle.But the very first time we made ice cream, we found that the crank would jam incessantly. If I pressed in on the handle in a certain way while cranking, the jamming was reduced a bit, but this was a nuisance. If one did not apply force in just the right way, the thing would jam again. (So much for friends and kids enjoying taking turns at the crank!)The second time we made ice cream, the jamming was even worse, and we noticed that metal filings were dropping down from the gear mechanism and were making their way into the ice cream.When I took the gear mechanism (the ""crank assembly frame"") apart, I discovered the problem: The gears inside are designed and manufactured badly. The gears are not held in place, but rather have about 1/8"" play. That is a lot of play. When the gears drift apart, they jam. The gears in our unit were badly gouged after only two uses! (The gears seem to be stamped from low-grade powdered metal.) The entire problem could have been avoided in the manufacturing by simply using a plastic spacer on the shaft that holds one of the gears, but this was not done.When I called about warranty service, I was told that a replacement gear mechanism would be shipped to me. That never happened. The next time I called, some months later, I was told that there was no record of my earlier call. Again, I was told that a replacement gear mechanism would be shipped to me. About a week later, a replacement handle arrived, not a gear mechanism.The third time I called about warranty service, I was informed that gear mechanism is not actually a replacement part, so that I should never have been told that one could be sent to me. (This is rather baffling: one can buy the part on the web.) I was also informed that the unit was out of its one year warranty. It did not seem to matter to them that my problems with the unit, and my contacts with them, had begun while the unit was only a few months old. Only when I assured them that I was holding in my hand a printed 5-year warranty did they continue to work with me. (Of course the company is fully aware of their flawed product, and of course they are fully aware that the product has been sold with a 5-year warranty. It seems that they try to bluff people who call for warranty service, hoping that they might not have a copy of thier warranty in-hand.)The result of this third call about warranty service was that the company agreed to replace my ice cream maker under warranty. But I was required to pay for shipping of my old unit back to them via UPS (an expense of $20) and for shipping of the replacement unit to me (an expense of $10). So the cost of my ice cream maker is up to $160. Luckily, they don't have any of the hand-crank models available to send out as a replacement, and so they are going to ship me an electric model instead. I'm hoping the electric one will be a better design - it does not have the gear mechanism that the hand-crank model has. But I certainly would not have paid $160 for an electric ice cream maker. My recommendation would be to buy a much cheaper electric ice cream maker of a more modern design from another company.",1
18,"Very poor service. I bought this cocktail shaker as a gift. The package came on time. But when I opened the package I noticed that the container that had the shaker inside was opened. The next moment I realized that the cover, top and the strainer of the shaker were missing. So I only got the bottom of the shaker in my package. It is very frustrating. I rated it as 1 star, so that I can post the review. Obviously, I  did not have a chance to use it",1
19,Like using a big tissue. These towels seem to be of poor quality. They are very light and quickly become saturated. An average size person would probably need two of the bath towels to dry off after taking a shower. Little pieces of fuzz continue to come off the towels even if you wash them prior to first use,1
20,extra light weight. I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice,1

22,"okay coffee, terrible espresso. I received this as a gift a year ago and I like the coffee maker part, the coffee comes out with a good flavor albeit a bit cold but it seems all coffee makers these days make the coffee a little cold. Once you mix in milk or 1/2 and 1/2 it is only lukewarm. The removable tank is nice (you can wash it) but awkward to use if you have the unit under a cabinet. Also the unit has a big footprint so that may be of consideration if your counterspace is limited.I used to have a Delonghi pump-driven espresso machine that worked great. This one has a steam driven espresso that most coffee connoisseurs will advise against. I now know why. The pressure builds inside the water tank as the espresso brews and after 1/2 a shot the machine just shoots out steam. I've tried different grinds and tamping the coffee really hard (you have to buy a tamper with this one) it still builds too much pressure and it shoots out bitter coffee flavored steam after a short while. Also the markings on the pots peel off pretty quick. Not worth the money unless you get it for cheap on ebay.",1
23,Tools. These are great towels if you can get them.  They are very soft and a great price but I ordered them in December and they came in one at a time.

When I ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship.Buy these only if you have a life time to get the,1

25,"Fails to pump and top does not attach to base. I would rate this ZERO but that option is not available.  The weight of the stainless steel is heavy, exactly what I had expected for 18/8.  However, the top does not affix to the base.  It seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base.  Furthermore, the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base.  That's worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter.  Yuck!I do NOT recommend the purchase of this product.",1
26,"Waffle Maker & Sandwich Grill. I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this Continental CE23711 Waffle Maker & Sandwich Grill. First of all, it was a month late in arriving and was purchased to replace a similar old Black and Decker unit that had grills that were deteriorating. This new unit was so flimsy that the inserted grills kept popping out because the whole unit was bent out of shape. I would have returned it but my husband had discarded the box after checking to see if it would heat. I felt like throwing it away because my old unit was so superior to this one but my daughter switched some of the fasteners around which hold the 2 plates in place and that worked but the unit must be handled carefully - a really disappointing purchase!!",1
27,"It's ok but definitely not as good as expected. They say this is so amazing because nothing sticks to it, it cooks food better than regular pans, odors don't stick to it, it's easy to clean.  Well, they got 1 out 4 right at least.  It is easy to clean.  But it is impossible to coook almost everything in it because everything i've tried comes out burnt on one side, not even done on the other side.  On the cookie sheet everything around the outsides burns.  In the cupcake pans or the cake pan, the top of the food cooks but the bottom doesn't.  It is very hard to get smells out of it.  And with a lot of stuff you still should spray it with cooking spray or it does stick a little.  I'm sure in some ovens and with certain foods they work great, but my experience wasn't so great",1
28,"Do Not Buy This Toaster. This toaster projectile ejects your toast right to the kitchen floor, even if the toaster is located at the back of the counter by the wall.

31,"Disappointing Egg Cooker. I ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time. I was sorely disappointed. There is no measuring cup, so all water amounts must be estimated (the unit has three ""lines"" to help, but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs); there is no buzzer when the unit is finished, so unless you babysit it, everything ends up overcooking. This is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled",1
32,"It's too thin on its' leading edge and warps. I love my other silcone spatula's by Mario but this one is not what I expected.  The edge warps, and it is very difficult to get it under a pancake for example and turn it over.  It literally was sticking and tearing the pancake and I was using a non stick griddle.  I think perhaps it needed to be a little less long so there would be more support for the food item. Not sure what the warping problem is cause I have only used it once...to try and turn the pancake and washed by hand.  I tried putting a weight on the leading edge and leaving it weighed down several days but when I checked to see if that fixed it...it was still warped",1

Color me dense, but after going through 8 Mr. Coffee coffeemakers in the past 10 years I'm tossin' in the towel!The longest period of time that one has lasted was about 18 months. I just think that a person should be able to get more than 12 to 18 months of use out of a $40 to $50 coffeemaker that is used to make only one pot of coffee per day. The problem with 5 of these 8 coffeemakers was the heating plate going out...ie just ceasing to heat at all. The problem with the other 3 was leakage...massive leakage, as in an instantaneous rupture in the water tank and the entire content emptying within a few seconds!So, after having cleaned up my most recent Mr. Coffee spill just a few minutes ago, I have finally (duh) decided it is time to give up on Mr. Coffee coffeemakers and never allow one of the foul quality beasts to darken my countertop again!My advise is...if anyone wants to buy a new $40 to $50 coffeemaker every year or so, buy a Mr. Coffee...otherwise steer clear of this poor quality product and shop for another brand. As to which brand of coffeemaker?...I have yet to discover that answer as I type this, but as I am searching I can promise one thing...it definitely will NOT be a Mr. Coffee product!This is the first comment/complaint I have ever written about a product on Amazon, but I was so peeved about this last mess I had to clean up that I felt the need to vent a bit.",1
36,"These knives are Stamped, not Forged. These knives get 2 stars for being priced like a forged knife set when they are actually stamped (lower quality).Knives come in two types.  Stamped or Forged.  Stamped knives are made by stamping out the shape of the blade from a piece of sheet metal.Forged knives are made by heating metal and pounding it into shape.  The blade on a forged knife can get thicker as it merges into the handle, and really take on any shape.Forged knives are undisputadly better. The metal is stronger, and the blade is FAR less likely to snap because it's tapered and thicker in the handle.  Forged knives are also generally more expensive.   The problem with this Kershaw set is not just that it's stamped.  Stamped knife sets are great choices for people on a budget.  But the problem is that this Kershaw knife set is priced like a forged set.Don't be duped.  Go look at Henckels or Wusthof.  They have some small sets in this same price range that are forged, and are much higher quality.For example - Amazon has ""J.A. Henckels 7-pc.

I own other Nordic Ware pans and have had better luck with them, but this particular mold is a loser, which was very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially be if it worked.

My old Dirt Devil was a workhorse and was used to spot clean the upholstery and floors in our RV, truck and car, and home, along with cleaning lots of other things such as draperies, pet beds, etc.  I used it daily for 15 years and never, ever had a problem with it.  This new bagless Dirt Devil has never worked right.  Immediately, the revolving brush quit revolving.  I returned the vacuum for a new one; the revolving brush never did revolve on it, even right out of the box.  The vacuum loses suction within a minute or two because of the useless filter system.  The Dirt Devil company won't take the unit back, and apparently they can't fix the brush problem, either, based on what I heard from appliance repair centers I contacted for service.  I've already told my daughter that I want my old Dirt Devil back, but she loves it so much that I may have to bribe her to get it out of her hands.

What can one expect for that price, it's just too good to be true so people should use common sense and be suspicious. And think about the costs of all these TV ads worldwide, they have to calculate that into the price too so one can imagine how much the actual production cost must be; no wonder they let them manufacture somewhere in China!So the Set arrived and my sister used it often and was pleased at first.

I am using my old 15 year old Oster and it is still working.  Also to my surprise it is doing a better job.  Just not as pretty.  I have KA stand mixer, hand blender, food processors large and small, emersion blender and attachments for all.  Love all of them.  Will buy other KA but not this again",1

I had a lot of trouble getting the carafe lid off and on, to the point where I wondered whether it was even supposed to come off! After only a couple of uses, the rubber seal on the lid broke. I am going to call customer service to see about getting it replaced. I'll update this review if I have any luck.Other than that, I love the look and compact design (I'm the only coffee drinker in my household), and it makes piping hot coffee! Brew process is slower than average, though",1
59,"Arrived broken. I like this type of opener very much, and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing.  So I opened the package, and tried to open a bottle of wine, but the corkscrew would not lock.  I'm not even sure I'll send it back given the warranty hassle, shipping costs, etc, given the price.  I just can't recommend this brand to anyone",1
60,"You get what you pay for. While the high end Riedel glasses are very nice, this set didn't even come close to my expectations.

A total disappointment",1
61,"STOPS WORKING. I bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs.  It works for a while then stops working, or just goes on warm.  They replaced it three times--everytime it went out.  This seems to be common with cheap rice cookers--see the reviews on the RIVAL RCS 200, they all go out within days or weeks!  I guess Black and Decker and Rival used the same Chinaman to design these useless things.  I can't understand why Amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do NOT work.  The companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately. In frustration I bought the Aroma 60-cupper for $125--and after two months that also went out.  Any suggestions on a 20-cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated",1
62,"Poorly designed. I wanted to love this, as I bought this on the recommendation of other professional cooks for its zippiness, simplicity, and sharp blades. I am pretty adept in the kitchen, but this tool is unsafe if you decide to use the flimsy finger guard. Also, the blades were not sharp enough to handle hard veggies, such as carrots, gracefully, so I was left struggling trying to jam them across the blade, the finger guard trying its best to go off track each time. The finger guard should be higher and somehow secure better to the track. Worker's comp not worth the risk--I'll stick w/ Bron",1

64,"Luck of the draw. We bought three of these when our building's boiler died, and while initially we were really pleased, a month later two out of three of them have died. The first one was clearly not right from the beginning--every time we turned it on, it blew the fuse. Back it went to the store. We figured it was just bad luck, since the other two were fine. But this weekend I went to turn off the second one and felt a huge static-y shock when I touched the button. Later in the day when I went to turn it back on, the light went on but not the fan or heater. It's dead.The third one is still chugging along, so I guess it's ok, but the thermostat never really worked on any of them--we've just used the high/low setting.End result: Don't waste your money. There's no way of knowing if you'll get a dud",1

I won't buy another",1
68,"Too Small. This may seem like a good ""aquarium,"" but it is not.  This is FAR too small for a betta.  Pet shops that sell them in tiny bowls do so because they are an inexpensive way to seperate them.  The pet shop conditions are intended to be ony temporary.  My betta is in about a 2.5 gallon tank and is so happy.  He was once in a small bowl and did nothing. Just lay on the gravel.  About a 3 gallon tank will house a much happier fish, and a more entertaining one.  Do not buy this",1

At least, when I put them in they are ok, but they are chipped when I take them out",1
70,"Nice shelf- But......... This perch is a great size for a large cat or even two cats together.  It is soft and appears to be very comfortable.  However, the way it attaches is by affixing a strip of velcro to your window sill, which then mates with the matching velcro on the bottom of the shelf unit.  There are two adjustable legs that are supposed to give support as they brace against the wall.  My window ledges are not very deep and so the shelf does not sit level.  The legs are adjusted to fit as closely to the wall as possible, however, mine do not move close enough in so that the legs stay securely on the wall and therefore, do not support the shelf properly.  We have tried putting a piece of folded cardboard under the part that sits against the wall, but this hasn't worked either. So unless you have very deep window ledges, this may not work for you. We bought two of these, but plan on returning one.  On a positive note, my cats love the shelf and took to it right away.  It is a great idea, but this one needs a little better design",1

That didn't work because it goes right into the water filter so it looks like it is at level 3 when it is more.The last straw was the other day as the water started to brew through the basket, the basket sprang open.

80,"Mold. Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser. All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.Pro:Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.)Con(s):Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it).Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth.Conclusion:Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product",1
81,"absolute garbage. This is not even a toy.  DO NOT waste your money on this item.

What I cannot put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on. It will appear to be on correctly, but if not, the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction. This creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister.Buy something else, I can't wait for this one to die",1
87,"Manufacturer would not exchange defective item. I received the CitriStar juicer, and immediately after opening it, found that, about 25% of the time, the motor would buzz instead of engaging and rotating.When I called Tribest, they told me firmly that I needed to press down on it using a citrus fruit instead of my hand, and then it would work properly. This turned out to not be true (not surprising, as the juicer does not appear to include sensors and circuitry to insure that the object pressing on it is a citrus juicer instead of, say, a couple of fingers). I called them back, and they said that I could only return it, under warranty, after registering the product. I did this, and called them back yet again. I was then told that they would examine it for possible warranty repair or replacement. When I told them that it was defective right out of the box, and that I did not want a repaired defective item, but a new item, they informed me that they simply don't do exchanges under any circumstances, and that they could not help me. I am currently taking care of this via my credit card company.The thing is, I really liked the product based on its description, more powerful motor, and so on.

I even changed the belt, though it looked fine, without any results. I'm afraid it will catch on fire because of how fast the motor is running now--it makes a sickly high-pitched whine.

Trying to wash them was another headache!  The first time i opened the medium bed to wash it, the zipper came apart (it wasn't fastened together at the end so the pull came right off) and cannot be fixed!  I had to permanently sew it together to keep my dog from pulling at it and chewing on the edges=fixed the problem, but now impossible to wash.  Also the interior did not hold up in the dryer.  Even on low heat the lining melted and stuffing was everywhere! Again i had to sew the holes together.

First of all, the suction cup at the bottom is worthless and the clamp is clumsily engineered and can only be used on a counter with a BIG lip on it, which in my kitchen, is in front of the dishwasher with the dishwasher's door open, which looks rediculous.  Then, in order to get any yield whatsoever, one must crank then reverse then crank again to have anything come out of the tiny hole near the crank (another design flaw.) On top of this, it takes almost a whole 18x24"" tray of wheatgrass just to make two one ounce shots, and that is with the compression cap screwed on the end. Something is wrong here...they only use half that amount at Wild Oats with their Champion juicers. Juice leaks out the handle, out the front and everywhere else except where it's supposed to go...in the cup. After doing this a few times and making a HUGE mess of grass clippings, green (staining) juice all over my countertop and me and a tedious 20 minutes to set it up, juice the grass and clean up, it's better I just stay with going to the local juice bar and spending the three bucks.

117,"If you're willing to pay this much, get a full-automatic machine. I checked out this machine at a local store.  It's little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine.  For that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately.Regarding this Delonghi machine, on the drip coffee side, metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with-- paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds.  On the espresso side, you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make, and then empty the strainer when you're done.  The optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee. For only a bit more money ($500 or so) you can get a full automatic espresso/cappuccino maker. I bought a full-automatic several years ago and my family loves it! Full-automatics grind the beans for each cup, they make excellent American-style coffee as well (simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee), and you dispose of grounds once a week.  The only disadvantage of full-automatics is that like every espresso machine, they do only one or two cups at a time.  So if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once, you'll need a plain old coffee maker like the right-hand side of the Delonghi",1

120,"Aeroccino is an unreliable gadget. When Aeroccino works, it works great. It is quick and quiet, and produces excellent foam. Clean up is very easy. But, there is something inherently unstable about Aeroccino machines.  Since August, I managed to kill three of them and I am not sure why. Part of it is the nature of the machine: because it is constructed like a water kettle, one should not submerge it into water.  But because it is designed to heat milk, the manufacturer allows putting it under running water as long as the bottom of the machine remains dry. If you get the bottom wet (and you will), the machine either trips (and heals itself after fully drying) or dies. I suspect, my first two Aeroccinos died such deaths.  My third one died today.  I frothed milk with it, refilled it and tried again (without cleaning in between) and the machine did not work.  I tried again and it worked for 20 seconds and stopped. I tried again a couple hours later and it worked for 10 seconds and stopped. I am not sure why it is so, but I suspect it has to do with the magnetic foaming brushes you must insert into the machine to make it work. If anyone has ideas why this is so, let me know.On the positive side I keep calling the company and they keep sending me new machines. I really like Aeroccino when it works. But I suspect it will be the good old microwave when I finally run out of warranty.",1

123,"Liner breaks easily 4 of 5 shattered within 12 month period. after owning a number of thermos' and other insulated bottles, this is the best at maintaining temperature and the easiest to break!parts are available thru zojirushi web site but with shipping and cost of gasket and liner ($3.90 and $8.60, respectively), cheaper to get another carafe.  after buying 5 total during the past year, i'm down to my last one.  thats it, going to another manufacturer.I did prechill the carafe before filling with ice-water and ice.  i put a cup of cold water in the bottle after a prechill of an hour.  Followed carefully with ice.  Upon putting the 1st cube in the bottle, the glass liner loudly shattered.  I have never seen liners break so easily.  I did notice on the last bottle i have left, before using it, the glass liner was rather loose in the carafe.  i took it apart, and hand tightened everything.  so far okay. this is the last carafe i'll buy that is zorirushi made",1
124,"cheap. I thought I was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price, but instead I got what a paid for and nothing more.  Cheap product at a cheap price.  Only used a few times, literally 2-3 times, then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere.  Luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined.  They feel really cheap too.  If you only want to use them a few times, get them, I know we will never get these again",1

It DOES NOT clean the water. It's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy. The water flows and the motor is running, the charcoal is in place but it doesn't clean the water. I'm better off with a bowl that I clean every day. This thing just swishes around dirty water.

130,"BEWARE, TAKE CARE, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM - NO!. I HAVE OWNED...6 ESPRESSO MACHINES THAT I CAN RECALL IN MY LIFE.1 GAGGIA, A HEAVY ITALIAN MACHINE WHICH I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MUCH BETTER CARE OF - WHICH MEANS WIPING OFF THE STEAM NOZZLE WHEN STEAMING MILK ALONG WITH RUNNING THE STEAMER WHILE WIPING, AND DECALCIFING WITH VINEGAR WHICH IS SMELLY BUT UNCLOGS MINERAL SEDIMENTS WHICH PRECIPITATE IN THE WORKINGS OF THE MACHINE.  THESE STEPS MUST BE PERFORMED ON ALL ESPRESSO MACHINES PERIOD CASE CLOSED.  THE GAGGIA I BELIEVE I GAVE AWAY OR THREW AWAY.1 PROTEO GRANDE, ANOTHER HEAVY ITALIAN MACHINE WHICH I NEGLECTED TO DECALCIFY BUT SIMPLY STORED AWAY 10 YEARS AGO.I HAVE ALSO OWNED 4 KRUPS MACHINES.  2 OF THESE KRUPS WERE THE VERY INEXPENSIVE VARIETY THAT LACKED A PUMP, BOTH OF WHICH FAILED BECAUSE THE PRESSURE VESSEL FOR STEAM BEGAN TO LEAK AND OVERHEAT.1 KRUPS MACHINE, A PUMP MACHINE MODEL 968 WORKED VERY VERY WELL FROM DECEMBER 1999 THRU FEBRUARY 2006.  MODEL 968 MADE EXCEPTIONAL ESPRESSO: (YOU GOT A VERY NICE CREMA LAYER AT THE END OF THE DRAW).  SIMPLY BECAUSE A LITTLE HANDLE IN FRONT WHICH SELECTED WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANTED STEAM, OR FLOWING WATER SNAPPED OFF, I WAS FORCED TO USE A KITCHEN KNIFE IN THE GROOVE LEFT BY THE SNAPPED OFF SELECTOR BUTTON, AND BECAUSE THIS CAUSED THE MECHANISM ITSELF TO PREMATURELY WEAR MADE THE UNIT UNUSABLE.UNUSABLE IS WHAT KRUPS XP 4000 IS, FOR SOME REASONS NOT PREVIOUSLY STATED.1.  ATTENTION XP4000 USERS: TAKE THE PLASTIC WATER STORAGE UNIT OUT AND CHECK THE BOTTOM OF THE UNIT.  MOST LIKELY YOU WILL SEE 1/4 TO 1/2 INCH OR MORE OF WATER THAT HAS LEAKED FROM THE WATER INTAKE VALVE.  NOW WITH THE MACHINE OFF! COOL! AND ALL WATER TRAYS AND TOP AND BOTTOM GRILLS REMOVED SIMPLY TURN THE UNIT OVER 90 DEGREES AND DUMP THE WATER OUT.  REPLACE THE PLASTIC WATER STORAGE UNIT, AND EVERYTHING ELSE.  THEN USE 'NORMALLY' IF YOU CAN FOR A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK.  THEN TAKE THE WATER STORAGE OUT AGAIN AND CHECK FOR WATER SEEPAGE AND LEAKAGE INTO THE MAIN PLASTIC HOUSING.  YOU SHOULD FIND THE SAME LEAKAGE PROBLEM.THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE DESIGN DEFECT WHICH PREVENTS WATER FROM COOLING THE BOILER, AND SERVICING THE STEAMER.2. AS WITH ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS THE STEAMER SIMPLY LEAKS A DRIBBLE OF HOT WATER, NOT ENOUGH TO MELT ICE.  IF YOU LEFT A PITCHER OF COLD MILK UNDER THE STEAMER AND RETURNED 15 MINUTES LATER YOU'D HAVE: WATERY LUKEWARM MILK!3. OTHER REVIEWS STATED THAT THE FROTH STEAMER ATTACHMENT CONSTITUTES A HAZARD AS IT FLYS OFF UNEXPECTANTLY.  KRUPS MODEL 968 HAD A SIMILAR ATTACHMENT WHICH I REMOVED AND THREW AWAY.WITH MODEL 968, THE STEAMER WORKED VERY VERY WELL WITHOUT THE FROTH ATTACHMENT FOR 6 YEARS.  OCCASIONALLY IT WOULD CLOG UP AND I'D TAKE THE END OF A SAFETY PIN TO UNCLOG IT, OR I WOULD SIMPLYUNSCREW THE PLASTIC HOUSING: IT WOULD REMOVE NICELY AND I'D PLACE THE STEAMER NIPPLE IN SOME HOT WATER AND VINEGAR OVERNITE,AND THE STEAMER WOULD PERFORM PRETTY NICELY.  NOTE: THIS IS MODEL 968 NOT XP 4000.  DO NOT TRY TO UNSCREW THE BLACK STEAM NIPPLE FROM XP 4000 SEE NOTE BELOW!!!YOU MAY USE XP4000 WITHOUT THE FROTH ATTACHMENT, AND IT WILL STEAM MILK OKAY, BUT IT MUST BE FUSSED WITH POKING THE HOLE IN THE BLACK STEAM NIPPLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT:--FREQUENTLY HOWEVER STEAM PRESSURE GOES DOWN SO LOW YOU HAVE TO PUT THE SELECTOR KNOB TO THE 90 DEGREE POSITION, ALLOW WATER TO FILL IN THE MACHINE AGAIN, CLICK OVER TO 'HEAT UP', THEN WHEN THE LITE GOES OFF YOU MAY CONTINUE STEAMING.KRUPS XP-4000 IS A PERFECT EXCUSE FOR BEING LATE TO WORK, OR ANYWHERE ELSE IF YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT YOUR LATTE.  AND I WILL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE TO GO TO STARBUCKS FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER UNLESS MY MACHINE FAILS.  WHICH IT DID!NOTE:  XP 4000 CANNOT HAVE IT'S RUBBER NIPPLE UNSCREWED, YOU ARE FORCED TO STICK A SAFETY PIN OR OTHER SHARP OBJECT IN IT TO UNCLOG THE MILK STEAMER.  THE HOLE IN THE NIPPLE ITSELF IS MUCH TOO SMALL: IT IS SMALL TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF PRESSURE FROM THE PUMP, KIND OF A WISHFUL DESIGN INTEGRATION TECHNIQUE WHICH FAILS OH SO MISERABLY!3.MY XP 4000 STARTED LEAKING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF WATER AFTER LESS THAN 45 DAYS OF USE.  I SENT IT TO A LOCAL KRUPS REPAIR FACILITY AND I IMAGINE I'LL EITHER GET ANOTHER XP4000 OR THEY MIGHT HAVE THE COMMON SENSE TO DISCONTINUE THE XP4000 AS A BAD DESIGN MISTAKE FROM BEGINNING TO END IF ANYONE UP THERE LIKES ME, AND KRUPS MIGHT UPGRADE ME TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE XP4050.SO NOW YOU HAVE IT.SO THERE I WAS ESPRESSOFIEND WITH NO JAVA, AND I'D RATHER PULL OUT MY FINGERNAILS THAN GO INTO STARBUCKS FOR LATTE.  ONLY I CAN MAKE THE PERFECT LATTE.  WHICH EXPLAINS WHY I AM SINGLE!SO, I TOOK OUT MY 10 YEAR OLD PROTEO GRANDE FROM UNDER MY SINK WHERE IT HAD BEEN STORED FOR 10 YEARS, AND SAID A PRAYER WHILE CLEANING THE COBWEBS OFF AND DECALSIFYING, ANDWOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT: IT WORKS!  JUST FINE!  BUT THEN AGAIN, THATIS WHAT I'D EXPECT FROM A HEAVY ITALIAN MACHINE.MORAL: IF YOU WANT TO SAY BYE-BYE TO STARBUCKS FOREVER, AND BREW THE PERFECT LATTE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, SPEND AT LEAST $200 ON A QUALITY ITALIAN MACHINE.  KRUPS DOES MAKE NICE COFFEEMAKERS, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.WHEW!  I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEBODY!",1

132,"Great pottery, ruined expectations by Macy's. We love Fiesta Ware pottery.  This is a quality product made of tough clay with well matched durable glaze. Because of this and its famous assortment of sumptious colors, I will buy it every time.  However, when buying this product from Macy's I found the following to be true:1.) Items or colors listed as in stock and shipping (the pizza plate for example)get listed as backordered after you purchase and languish for months before the order is inexplicably canceled.2.) Items that are seconds quality being sold as first quality. On average, 10% of our orders included slay slubs, glaze missing in spots and other imperfections.3.) Range of products severely limited4.) Color choice from available range severly limited.So, in short, buy Fiesta Ware. A quality product, made in the United States, of charming beauty--but reconsider Macy's as your Amazon supplier",1
133,"Not happy with ""silverwear marks"". I bought a huge set of these, some from Amazon and some from Marshall Fields. Unfortunately, the plates and smaller dishes began to show tons of silvery/gray marks from silverwear almost immediately. I was so dissappointed that I asked at Marshall Fields and the employee said that the glaze is not thick enough on the stoneware and that she had heard similar complaints from others. The only way to get it off (and not even completely) is to scrub them for a long time with ""BarKeepers Friend"" or a similar powder. I thought I was going to have this set forever, but I'm now shopping for something new. I'm almost embarrassed to serve company with them. The plates are quite big and rather heavy. But the shape of the bowls and cups are nice. Too bad",1

135,"Whoa! Don't even think about it!. Buy the ""Office Fish Tank"" only if you want to end up sitting around at work and watching your dead fish float around at the top!This ""tank"" doesn't even hold a full gallon of water. The ""decorations"" take up an ungodly amount of space in it and have sharp edges which can be harmful to your fish. You can't just ""rinse and refill"" an aquarium either. You need to treat the water first, or you'll kill your fish even faster. But maybe that would be a blessing for it, when compared to having to live in those conditions?If you're going to spend 25-30 dollars on a fish tank, just go to Wal-Mart and buy their 10 gallon kit! It's not much more expensive, and your fish will be MUCH happier with you!",1
136,I think it sucks!. The Design of this knife is HORRIBLE!  Not all people are as careful as they want to and we know what we will get (painful cut!). This brand is not taking people's security into consideration. The corner close to the handle is general really sharp and some items even have a curve that is making it worse.I am really unsatisfied that the sharpness of this brand's collection is good enough while you may get a few stitches on your skin easily,1

138,Very dissapointed with this Power Mop. I was very disspointed in this product. It is much heavier than I thought. The scrubber head moves as described but doesn't remove dirt from crevices with any efficiency. A sponge and elbow grease would do the job faster.  The bottle that contains the liquid gets jammed so the liquid is unable to squirt on to the floor. The lever that switches the mop head to scrubber is awkward and retracts at times.  There isn't a good thing to say about it,1
139,"Dangerous!. I purchased this toy for a friend's dog a while back. The dog loved it, he played with it non-stop (quack! quack!). When he finally destroyed it though we were shocked. Inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag. My friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items. We did complain to the manufacturer who said they'd look into it, but I would still be wary of this toy.I think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it's toys, but doesn't rip them to shreds! There is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe!",1
140,"Not The Best.... This is a neat food storage idea, but the quality of this product leaves alot to be desired.  Although this was very easy to put together, it is shaky and doesn't seem very sturdy once the food is in the containers.  The flexible plastic (it's like a silicone material) that is in the bottom of the container that ""controls"" the portions that come out actually crush some pieces of cereal (I used Multi-Grain Cheerios and also Cocoa Crispies).  The top is just a loosely snapped on top.  I thought it would have more of an air-tight seal.  There is a small flexible plastic cover to put on the bottom of the container (where the cereal comes out) and that seems to have good seal, too bad they didn't do the same type for the top.  As a side note, the one I received appreared to be more of an off-white than white.I'm still going to use the product - my little girls love seeing their cereal in the containers and having it like a candy dispenser.  If (or when) it breaks, I don't plan on replacing it.  I'll go back to using the Rubbermaid/Tupperware containers",1

142,"Weak Product and Wretched Customer Service. The problem with this product is two-fold. First, the washable center plate is fragile and can break easily.  Second, the company's customer support is terrible.  I ordered a replacement from the Cuisinart Webstore, but they did not pack it properly so it was broken during shipping.  They refunded the price of the plate ($10), but would not refund the shipping and handling ($5.95) or the return shipping for the plate broken because of their poor packing ($8.45).  I would not recommend buying any products from them.  I am out $14.40 and have nothing to show for it except my original cracked plate.  I contacted several departments of theirs and received no reply",1
143,"Won't make thick froth so don't bother. I purchased this BonJour frother to replace my old AeroLatte frother.  The difference between the two brands is startling!  The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk.  This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down.  I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won't last long.  On the othe hand, the Aerolatte frothers(also widely available with several models on Amazon) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create.  I'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that don't need thick foam (like mixing salad dressing)",1
144,"I've hated this can opener - twice!. My entire kitchen is Kitchenaid. I bought this can opener three years ago. It was awful...difficult to use, shredded the paper at the top of the can's label, and was very difficult to get started. Because I love Kitchenaid products so much, I assumed that this was just a defective can opener, threw it away, and bought another. The second one was even worse! It worked okay the first couple of times, but now it barely cuts at all. It grinds the top of the can, making dents, but won't actually make a cut. Once I can get it started, I cannot finish it because it ""messes up"" the can pretty badly. This one is going in the garbage as well. :",1

If you put in too much batter, plan on the batter going in to the many cracks and crevices the design team thought they would add just for annoynance sake. The waffles we made turned out flatter than any pancake we'd ever made. Boo, hiss. Come on Cuisinart, you can do better than this",1
147,"disappointing. I was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for Xmas. However, if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs, I won't be using it often.The literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre-seasoned, and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat. On the first try I had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots, though I was able to get it to release with a pancake turner. The scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off, even with soaking for awhile.On the second try I oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread, so as to not have any bare spots. I still had sticking! Ditto for clean up.This thing weighs a ton, too. It is awkward to transfer off the burner; the instructions warn ""lift, do not slide"" on a glass top stove.I think I'll continue to use my non-stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press. That always works great!",1

The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours. But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before. I'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half.

There is something about the square shape which is very appealing on the dinner table.  However, figuring out how to drink from these is somewhat of a challenge.  Drinking from the edge is somewhat risky since there is nothing to channel your water into your mouth.  Unless your mouth is especially wide, it is easy to wind up with a wet lap when your drink flows right past the corners of your mouth.  Drinking from the corner is more satisfying, but somewhat uncomfortable",1

This is an ingredient found in all of the fruit snacks in our grocery store.  I ordered this one and when it arrived I was seriously disappointed.  Construction was subpar and the fact it is a passive dehydrator meant it required an extraordinary amount of time to process the foods we wanted dried.  It also required rotation of the trays, something I did not like.  I immediately returned it and ordered the Nesco American Harvest FD75PR with the fan in the lid and the powerful 700 watt heating system.

We did it in spite of the mixed reviews on epinions.com, and the negative advice of the sales person. He warned that the product has very bad reputation, that he would not accept returned. We decided to buy it regardless based on the stories from our relatives in China that Haier is very good brand name in China. The company offers excellent services in China. They tried to the extreme to make their Chinese customers happy.Less than a month after the purchase, the combo broke down. It was a fuse problem, and common one with the machine. The repair personal came to fix it. The machine stopped working roughly a month later that the dryer stops working. The repair personal had to order parts to fix it. He did fix it again. After about a month, the machine's dryer stopped working. This time, the repair personal declared that the machine is beyond repair. He promised to report to Haier America, and request a replacement on our behalf. However, we could not reach the repair personal again.Ever since that we started long saga of talking Haier's service center in America. They always appeared to be nice and promise to look into what happen to our complains. But they never fulfil their promise.When the warranty is about to expire, we tried to contact Haier China, they promised again, but to no results.Finally, our relatives in China had to call Haier China. This time, a reliable manager took action. His staff called us, and arrange the replacement. We just got the replacement machine. But we're still worrying when it will break again.It seems Haier may be really trying, but their business model, an d volumn in US may not be able sustain the level of quality that they are used to provide in China. It's a challenge to Haier USA to achieve the scale of ecconomy, or invest to provide good services to attract enough customers.Haier should really appreciate those early adopters and treat them well for their own sake",1

Check out the Panini Grill - unless you had these products in front of you & were able to open them up, you'd never be able to tell the difference between them.

I was originally very happy with the purchase - the set looked great, didn't chip easily, and was a great size.After a year of use I've come up with a list of problems:The clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed.The semi-matte finish acquires a ""powdery"", almost bleached, look to it after many washings (says dishwasher safe, guess that means the colors don't wash away immediately)My biggest complaint:  We bought these because they were ""microwave safe"".  I don't know what microwave safe means to most people, but it means to me that I could put a plate, bowl or cup in the microwave, heat up the contents, and then safely remove the object and use it.  In the case of the set I purchased, it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode.Unfortunately in the case of the Sango Graphite set, it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the (plate/bowl/cup) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the (plate/bowl/cup) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave.  They get VERY hot!  (Cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120F while cup surface is 170F!) I've only broken 2 items from the set, both times I dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned (first time I thought it was a fluke, second time I learned my lesson) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave.I emailed Sango several times and received no response at all.While I liked the set a lot initially, I have been very disappointed over time with its quality. I will never purchase another from Sango again",1
166,You need three arms... I returned this--absolutely unusable. Could not keep bottle engaged WHILE pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms,1
167,"Horrible suction.... I am SO disappointed with this vacuum!  I will say, it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet, but don't expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye!  Also, I have a cat - so I have pet fur on my carpet... AND I lose a lot of hair myself, and this vacuum doesn't pick any of that up... I can vacuum, run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair.It would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet... it seems to do that very well, though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum, shake the filter out, etc, because it gets clogged VERY fast",1

169,"Horrible. We ordered 4 of these to use for a small work function, and 2 of the 4 worked for about 15 minutes.  The other 2 would not push the chocoloate thru the auger at all.  By 30 minutes, all 4 augers were inoperable.  We cleaned them off and added more oil to already tempered chocolate, hoping even thinner chocolate would help, but no luck.  We ended up pulling the fountain part off, turning off the auger and using them as mini crock pots to keep the chocolate warm.  I do not recommend this product",1
170,Very disappointing. I bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful. It fell apart the first time we used it. It even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood. I do not recommend this product at all.,1
171,"A good idea in theory; cheap handle broke the deal for me. I was so excited about ordering this (sad, I know!).  I liked the idea that this vac was human-powered, and that it would allow me to do quick clean-ups between regular vacuuming.I was disappointed at how cheap the handle was, and how easily it came apart.  Basically, in order to ship the thing in a small box, the handle comes in 3 pieces.  You have to put them together -- the round tubes just ""slide"" into each other.  Unfortunately the pieces are not threaded, and don't stay together terribly well. If I had a really old vac that needed to be held together with duct tape, that's one thing.  However, I'm not keen on having to duct tape brand new things.The pickup was okay, but not great.  After a few passes, there was still dirt on my tile floor.  It occured to me that I had not found the magic vac of my dreams, so I ended up sending it back",1
172,"Low coverage. We now have the 4.2 gallon humidifer, as well as the air softener, all Vornado, and this one is most disappointing.  The construction is a bit flimsy, but my biggest complaint is the area coverage.  The unit is supposed to support at least a 600 sq ft space.  We have it in our master bedroom which is smaller than this and the air still feels very dry in our bedroom even after we've been running it for 2 days now non-stop on the high setting.  Granted, I have a pretty heightened sensitivity to the moisture in the air in our bedroom given I have a cold and nasal congestion, but I expected more from this unit given our satisfaction with the other.  We run the air softener on our 1st floor, which covers several rooms and it definitely maintains a level of moisture there very well.  The 4.2 unit is in our basement, which again covers several room and that one also has met our satisfaction.  We bought this because we needed one just for our master bedroom and we are pretty disappointed.  We have radiator heat and are suffering through the cold winter of Chicago right now.",1

Desperate for an oil mister a few months back, I checked around and found that no mister available anywhere on the Web for less than $25 was getting good reviews. Almost everyone had something bad to say about the mister they'd purchased.When I found the Norpro 790 on Amazon there were no reviews, but it looked nice and the price was right, so I thought I'd give it a try.After a few months of use, here are my findings--Pros:* Good looking.* Decent price.* Stainless steel exterior rather than plastic.* Good size.* Works, but...Cons:* Like many misters, you can blow out the bottom if you pump it too much.* In order to get a fine, well-spread mist you have to pump it to the point where you almost blow out the bottom.* When pumped, the cap will not sit flush. Ruins the look.* The nozzle itself is not of the best quality.* Can be inconsistent in its performance for no apparent reason.So overall, it's okay, but nothing to write home about",1

In fact, I had to abandon that side of the house until I hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog",1
181,"Mediocore light. I had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews, but it isn't so hot.

I had originally tried the Isotonic Ultra Contour pillow and wanted a cheaper version of that pillow so I decided to try this.The description certainly made it seem as if this would be a worthy runner up to the Isotonic memory foam pillow. Boy, was I wrong. This pillow is extremely firm, to the point that it hurt to even sleep on. I didn't feel that it contoured to anything! It also seemed to build up heat. The overall experience was terrible. In fact, I woke up in the middle of the first night of having it and went and packed it up for return. If you are looking for a rock hard pillow, this is great I guess but if you are looking for something along the lines of the fantastic Tempurpedic pillow (or Isotonic) do spend the money and get those instead. The difference is astounding",1

We have ours in a larger foyer, but often the chiming disrupts TV watching etc, so I actually just took them out.  I'm happy with the end result eventhough I wished the product did work.  So I guess I'll wait for the prosperity to kick in to off set the cost :",1

This product is a poorly designed piece of crap that is destined to fail from the first day you use it.A friend had purchased this item a few months back and asked me to look at it when it died recently. (I have been repairing electrical and electronic equipment for almost 30yrs). This is a perfect example of a ""throw-away"" item. If more care had gone into the design and a few more dollars into producing it you might have a product that could last a few years. Neither was done. Look at how many reviews mention the item failing after only a few months... and even the positive reviewers usually have only been using it for a month or so-Do yourself a favor and buy a commercial grade hot plate from a reputable manufacturer. You will pay more but you will likely still be using it many years from now. (Not too mention that the operation will be better also). How much ""VALUE"" is in a $20 hot plate when it is headed to the landfill a few months from now? It is a shame that so many people are willing to accept low quality products these days and think it is OK if it lasted a few months (note the reviews...)Good Luck-",1

The powerhead is too big, making it hard to maneuver into smaller places.  The dust cup is rather complicated to detach and empty.  WORST OF ALL IS THE SUCTION---there is very little suction (unless my unit was defective; a possibility, considering how crappy the suction was).

The heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do...allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm.  That was the good news.  The bad news is that after a few months, it broke down.  It turns OFF when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up.  As another reviewer said, it is now an attractive retro paperweight, but that's about it.  I was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having, I'm not going to bother.  After battling with Delonghi over other retro products, I'm giving up.  I won't buy any of their stuff anymore.  By the way, if you want a great, silent heater, try the Bionaire Micathermic model (BNRBH3900U).

The PS2, and DVD cases are too big to fit into these slots. I had just not realized that they would not work with this model.

I'm starting to wonder who writes these things ... LG employees? The microwave is fine - no complaints. The toaster, however, is an unmitigated disaster. I am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance is a poster child for this thought. The toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently (sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10!). More importantly, the toaster broke after 31 days (coincidently the Best Buy return policy ends at the same time - Best Buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named ""Ricky"" managing the store what can you expect?). LG picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty. The problem is they can't think outside of the box. They had me get it repaired but I have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up - OK ... no problem. One day later? It breaks again. It is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not. That's how bad it was. LG will not budge - have it repaired again (great option - costs LG money, me more travel time, and it won't do the job) or do a rebate. The rebate requires me to buy another LG or Goldstar product. Huh? So you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace (they admitted they don't have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new) and then don't stand behind your product. You backend me into another LG or Goldstar product that I would not have otherwise bought. How does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here? Our we so bad as a manufacturer that we can't top this? Their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this. ""You can cal Korea but they won't change their policy"" they said. I will never willingly buy another LG or Goldstar product and I highly recommend you do the same. Shame on you LG - you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me",1

229,"ice bucket review. Received this as a gift.  It is real classy looking but very small. So ok, you have just a few friends over for drinks- evem then I question functionality??- The cover is very difficult to replace securely and it is not insulated, so how well will it work??",1
230,"No fleur-de-lis. These dishes are everything they say they are EXCEPT the embossed pattern does not in any way, shape, or form resemble a fleur-de-lis, but rather looks much like a scorpion or bug, complete with a body and legs. The smaller pattern in between the insects resembles a marijuana leaf. So...if you want to impress guests with bugs and pot leaves on your serveware this is the set for you",1
231,"DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!. I gave this machine 1 star because the carafe does not drip -- and this is important!  However, for a household that brews several pots of coffee a day and likes a good, rich, bold cup of coffee, the Cuisinart Grind & Brew is a poor choice.  The grinder doesn't have the bean capacity for 10 cups (however, the carafe is really closer to 8 or 9 six-oz cups).  WEAK COFFEE.  If you grind a batch then turn it off and grind a second go to make a suitable pot, it is STILL weak.  Somehow the brewing process wastes coffee.  It backs up into the grinder and makes a royal mess.  Of course if you want to brew another pot in an hour or two, the grinder has to be hand-dried after you wash it with a bottle brush to get all of the wasted, caked, wet grounds out of the grinder.  Now here's the real kicker that nearly drove my husband over the edge.  Say you've washed the grinder and it's drying in your drainer so you decide to brew a pot of GROUND coffee, you still have to use the grinder!!!  It won't brew without it in place! so all that condensation flows right back up into the grinder, which stays perpetually WET and begins to pool in all the indentations here and there in the grinding chamber.  It's a mess.  The coffee us terrible -- even if you use plentiful, bold Starbucks coffee!!  Gosh!  We might as well have flushed $150 down our toilet . . .",1
232,"Noisy. This filter does seem to work well, however, I am returning it due to the excessive noise that it makes.  If you look at the other reviews (for the HFD-130) you will see the noise described as ""white noise""; let me explain the noise that it makes a little better than that.  The unit does make a white noise that is associated with the moving fan blades.  However, underlying this noise is a lower pitched motor noise that is more of a whining sound - like a vacuum cleaner.  This noise is less than the white noise on the low setting, about equal to the white noise on medium, and overpowers the white noise on high.  The other quality of the whining noise is that you can hear it from a further distance than the white noise.  So when you have the unit on high, you can hear the whining noise resonating throughout my home, i.e. through the floorboards and through the walls.I think that one of the greatest considerations with an appliance such as this should be noise.  I cannot understand why the Honeywell engineers have not done a better job considering this",1
233,"No manual in the box, no manual on the website. I bought the HM630 yesterday. Today, the unit tells me the filter needs replaced. After one day! So I went to read the manual and then remembered the box didn't even contain a manual. So then I went to the Holmes website listed on the box, and their website doesn't even list this unit as one of their products.VERY impressive, Holmes. Veeery impressive",1
234,"This thing doesn't suck!. The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom",1
235,"Great Machine but very delicate. This is an awesome machine and it looks hot in your kitchen.  However, unless you plan on using it only sparingly, don't bother with it.  I live and breathe espresso, so I used it at least three times a day or more.  It worked perfectly for about a year and then it just stopped working one day - without warning.Id say if you wanna buy it for the looks and plan on using it only once or twice a week - its a great purchase.  Otherwise skip it and buy something like the Rancilio Silvia; which Im planning to purchase to replace my non-working Granos",1

Took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock.  When I ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship.Buy these only if you have a life time to get the,1
238,"Don't waste your money. I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking.  I pushed the manual button and still nothing.  It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute.  It was a complete waste of my money",1
239,"Not worth it. I have owned this unit for 2 years.  The water seems OK and definitely better than from the tap.  However, every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back.  The replacement cartridges are very expensive.  There is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter, and this knob recently has broken off.  We cannot seem to access the company's website to get a replacement part.  I am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether.  I would not buy again.  (Also, I have had lots of problems with their water bottles...leakage, breaking, etc.  I won't buy any product from this company again.",1

241,"Looking for a new vacuum...forget this one!. I bought this vacuum cleaner less than a year ago and it has been in the repair shop more than it has been at my house.  The belt has broken at least 4 or 5 times and the self-propel system keeps breaking down.  When I took it in just last week to be repaired again, the repair shop owner pointed to the back room and said over half of the vacuums they repaired were this model.Actually, when the vacuum works, it does a decent job...although I don't think I would buy a bagless type again.  Emptying the container creates a mess unto itself! So my recommendation is stay away from this Hoover model",1
242,"Hamilton Beach Eclectric coffeemaker, apple. I didn't even use this coffemaker.  The apple color was so ugly (reminded me of the avocado in kitchens of the '50's & 60's) and the pot was so heavy & clunky, I decided to donate this to a charity.  I read the other reviews & everyone loved the color in their kitchen.  Maybe another color would be better but I will not try",1
243,"Compact size, good storage, poor aesthetics and finish. Functionally, this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner.  It is not attractive to look at however.  My walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany, there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish, the varnish is very high gloss, and the knobs are low-grade, mismatched junk.  I believe the build is solid, but only time will tell.Final word....pay the extra money for a hand-crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally.  This just isn't worth $300",1
244,"Very Disappointed. This product had adequate suction while it lasted which was about 4 months.  One day it just stopped working, I can only assume that the motor died",1
245,"When a plus is a negative. My previous Back to Basics model expired in less than two months when the teeth engaging the blade simply stripped. The lightweight model pictured here fared less well, lasting for one smoothie: when I tried to use it a second time, it was, to quote Dickens, ""dead as a door nail.""  If the same happens to this ""Plus"" unit, you'll have on hand more useless items than the blender itself. (The good part is its distribution by Amazon, assuring no-hassle returns and refunds.)It's a nice concept--make your smoothie on the run, and have one less glass to wash.  If you still want to try a small-sized blender, I've had surprising success with the cheap and tiny Hamilton-Beach personal blender",1
246,"Truly Disappointed. I was really excited to try this cage out for my 6 lb male maltese.  It is a perfect size and it seemed really well made.  My dog doesn't really like cages and was able to chew right through the zipper seam.  He is NOT aggressive and does not chew things he shouldn't, so to my surprise about a week after my husband and I bought the cage, we found him out of it.  We were truly disappointed.  It is a cute cage and has a very sturdy frame.  If you are not planning on zippering the cage or your dog does not chew through zippered seams, it is a great cage.....but overall, i was disappointe",1
247,"absolutely uncomfortable. When I got these for my daughter, I was shocked at how rough they were.  She really likes Thomas, so I kept them for a while.  Yet now that we've had them for a time, even she- at 2 1/2 yrs old- says they are scratchy.  They are at the bottom of our sheet rotation and ONLY used when absolutely everything else is dirty. I plan on making some sort of wall hanging craft out of them soon",1
248,"poor execution in design. Seemed like a good idea.  however, the spring-loaded arm is too strong, so it actually squeezes the paper towel roll too hard, so i couldn't remove a sheet.  had to return it.  i suspect they didn't test one out before production and distribution.  i plan on getting a pendulum model next",1
249,"Fantastic concept, but... I pre-ordered this right after I saw it on ""I Want That Tech Toys"" and it finally arrived just after Christmas, after nearly five months of waiting. The first few days had serious set up issues where the water wouldn't drain. My cats were interested in watching it but since the water wouldn't go out they were not interested in using it for its intended purpose. I had it sitting next to their Litter Maid and they wouldn't use the new box. Their excessive use overwhelmed and burned out the Littermaid motor so it had to be thrown out. Now, with just the Cat Genie I hoped they would adapt. They did not - they pee on the floor, poop on the floor. Finally one of the four was willing to use the new box... then it stopped draining and even that one cat would't go near it because it was full of water. I am at my wits end, plugging and unplugging trying to reset it. I have made two attempts to contact the parent company who makes these with no return calls or emails. I am very tech saavy, we have lots of robots around here... roombas, scoobas, spotbots and others so this cat genie was ideal but I guess it isn't ready yet.",1
250,"It leaks!!!!. The reason you should not buy this shaker is because it doesn't do what it should (keep a tight seal).The cocktail shaker looks very nice, I got the blue one.  However, the problem is that the lid does not form a tight enough seal, so what happens is that the liquid leaks out and gets all of your hands.  My remedy has been to put a kitchen towel over it while I use it (not very fun).  Also, condensation has built up in between the plastic insulation and the metal tumbler.  That's not really a big deal to me, but it may be to you",1
251,wrong size. I was very disappointed when I saw this plate. It said salad plate. It is the size of a bread & butter plate. Not a salad plate which was what I wanted. And the pattern is not at pretty as it looks in the picture.,1
252,Don't buy this coffee pot. I got this coffee pot last Christmas and it worked great for about three months. Now it takes 45 min to brew 8 cups and it sounds like I live by an airport. I have cleaned it but that isn't the problem. I did have to buy a new one since I couldn't deal with the noise or waiting so long for a cup of coffee,1
253,"An Experiences User. I am a very experienced user of Innova.  Innova is I guess you can say is the parent company of Ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware.Innova is not know for quality and this product is no different.  There is a 25 year warranty on the Ultrex, I had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off.  You can return the product for another but yes, you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized, you have to pay UPS or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge.The customer service is not world class.  I had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement.  The workmanship is horrible, the product is made in China, however, I've had other things made in China that were of great quality, so I don't know what is up with Innova.I suggest that if you find a product made by Innova, avoid it!  Save yourself the aggrevation!  This product doesn't deserve 1 star",1
254,"Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner a joke!. This thing does nothing!  Aside from the fact that after using it, instructions are to polish it with a soft cloth, even then the jewelry was not clean.  So it put it in my old jar of jewelry cleaner, used the little brush, dried it and went on my way.  Took much less time and did a much better job.  They shouldn't even sell this product!!!! And, I had to spend $10 to send it back. Do yourself a favor and skip this one",1
255,Very cool but didn't last long. I bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and didn't lit on; i didn't matter because they look beautiful underwater...    one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too; i replaced the beams but they stop working days later. it's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium. (unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks),1
256,"Not up to Oneida's usual standards. I just received mine and they look like Oneida seconds.  The edges were poorly finished (for Oneida, though no snags or obvious rough unfinished patches) and quite a few have an off centered Oneida stamp.On the plus side, they are solid and attractively designed.  They're a decent value at Amazon's prices and acceptable for everyday use",1
257,Find another blanket. I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.,1
258,"toxic heat. I bought this in November, 2006 and wanted to use it in my bedroom while I kept the thermostat down in the rest of my apartment to save money.  A plus for this item is its three settings, but the thermostat is very confusing to use.  I can't say if the heater has saved me money or not.  However, a BIG NEGATIVE is that it gives off a lot of fumes.  the brochure says it only does this when its new but that seems to be very untrue.  It smells a little like kerosene combined with a funky musky odor and it emits this constantly.  I found myself getting sick: chills in my hands, feet and legs as well as shortness of breath.  the heat it gives off is very good, a strong radiant heat that heats the whole room (my room is about 12' by 12'), but the fumes are actually a health hazard and I believe this heater should only be used if you are able to ventilate your room while you are heating it (which kind of doesn't make much sense)",1

With a metal fork to turn eggs, they scratch.And though the company claims on their site not to contain Teflon (of course not, Teflon is Dupont's trade name for PTFE), the product is coated with nonstick PTFE - which is known to kill pet birds.

I couldn't tell you if it is durable, because he hasn't played with it enough to actually rip it.It contains two squeakers that scare him.My guess is some dogs would like this toy, the shape is pleasing to dogs, I think my dog just didn't like the texture.I reccommend anything by Fat Cat Inc. in place of this toy",1

It barely picks up even simple dirt and debris, and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds, not minutes.Also, it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into Bank of America and swipe a few mil. Really, its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge. Stupid....stupid...stupid design. The same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together...its like a rubics cube.A true waste of 40 bucks. Don't buy this! It doesn't even look very cool",1

I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.I threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn't last long at all.

This product works well for me (I have a very small one-level house) but getting the HEPA filters that go with it is harder than finding that needle in the haystack. You used to be able to get them at most retail stores--now, Euro-Pro won't even supply them to the vacuum specialty companies.  I've made tons of calls and all they've done is echo my complaints.  The ONLY way I was able to find them, besides on this site, was through Euro-Pro itself.  They try to get you to sign up for their ""filters for life"" program first on their site, which is a ripoff.  If you just order their filters, they don't give you an 800 number to call--I found one in an old filter box--they want you to do it all over the web.  Why?  Because they're in India, at least the ""customer service"" people are.  While waiting on my filters to arrive, I borrowed another model Shark vacuum from someone, and I couldn't even get to the air filter to clean it--the instructions say it should just pop out--ha, ha.  Clearly, Euro-Pro doesn't want you to keep their products for a long time, which is why they stop making the parts easy to get after a few years.  I have only had my vacuum for three years, not thirty.  It should be easier to get filters than this.  Much, much, much easier. I spent a minimum of eight hours trying to get these filters over a few weeks. Next time, I'm buying a Bissell",1

After reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible, the leak was slightly reduced.  The metal jar still poured out liquids from the base.Second thing I noticed:  this blender cannot make a good smoothie.  Even after a couple minutes of blending, there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades (regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie).  For a blender of any price, the DeLonghi does a poor job making smoothies.  For a blender that costs what the DeLonghi does, this performance is totally unjustifiable.But, hey, it does look really good",1
296,"Didn't work. This thing never worked out of the box.. not worth trying to RMA it for the low cost of it, but dont recommend it.",1

302,"NOT worth the price....Much better knives out there!. First of all, let me say, I'm a loyal Amazon customer and do most of my online research for items on Amazon, so when I really like something (or not, in this case) I feel compelled to speak out. I don't like to give negative reviews, but this knife is just simply so-so, nothing special and at this price, it should be SPECIAL. One particular thing is that in all of Rachel Ray's TV shows (and I watched a lot of them) I have never once seen her use this knife!!  What's with that? Why put her name on something she doesn't use?  Cash,maybe? hmmmm That's disappointing. The handle is orange, and feels okay, if a little heavy in the hand. The blade is heavy and just feels too thick to me, and it doesn't cut easily. I have average size hands. I have since purchased a set of four of Wolfgang Puck's knives with a wooden block for less money than the price of this knife and that was the clincher for me. His knives are outstanding! I always reach for Wolfgang's knives now...they are perfectly balanced, very sharp, and I couldn't be happier with them.",1
303,"Cheap junk. I bought one of these can openers today. The mounting screws stripped out even before I got it completely mounted. The screws thread into soft metal tabs instead of nuts, making it impossible to mount securely. I don't know if it would open a can, as I never got that far, but it looks difficult to locate the can properly. It's a piece of cheap Chinese made junk",1

Even on the darkest setting (5), the waffles come out limp as a noodle, and with the insides of the waffles tasting like warmed, but RAW, batter! If your idea of a good waffle is raw batter, you will love this machine. Now I get to re-package it and mail it back. Isn't that always fun? The people who have given this a positive review here need their heads examined! Don't be deceived by them like I was. Believe me, save yourself the expense and the aggravation, and DO NOT BUY this piece of garbage!",1

310,"Unraveled after First Washing :(. I ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button, snap, zipper, catch, or anything else that could possibly have snagged it.It was not nearly as soft as I expected for the price either. It was better than what you'd expect from your standard hotel towel, but it wasn't any softer than my towels from the JC Penny Collection.The redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet",1
311,"No blade pizza cutter. I thought I was ordering a pizza cutter.  When the order arrived I noticed it didn't have a blade, or maybe you call the wooden edge ""a blade""!When you combine the costs of the pizza cutter with the shipping and handling it's the most expensive piece of wood I've ever purchased.I was looking for a real pizza cutter, not a block of wood to hang on the wall",1

313,worst new idea. I bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by Mens Health Magazine. None of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one. Initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots don't line up just right the mug will not work.  I have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently. Stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation,1
314,BAD COFFEEMAKER. Coffeemaker just quit yesterday makes cold coffee now unable too use. got a three year warranty and lasted three months. Biggest waste of money yet. Now call customer service get a busy signal last 15 minutes. never buy another hamilton beach product.,1
315,"Not a good investment :-(. The product description was great and I was looking forward to a cosy and heavenly blanket :-)  To my dismay this product was nothing like that...  It is ultra thin and like a paper thin foam sheet used in packing material ... lol..  It's both funny and disappointing... The thing is not a blanket at all... The sides are cut as if someone did that with a pair of scissors... the sides look real tacky.. This is one of those types of blankets that will not trap your body heat inside.. infact since you can see your hand from under the blanket, the cheap blanket will give way to any body heat emitted and the heat will easily escape from the blanket.The other thing is that this is no twin blanket... Being single I sleep on a twin bed, and its nice and cosy.. got three heavy duty blankets to keep me all warm in the winter... all of them are quality and ultra cosy and heavenly!  So these three blankets are exactly the same size - all by different manufacturers... which tells me that there is a standard size for twin blankets......  Though this blanket is quite a bit smaller in width than my three blankets.  It's so silly... to call such useless things, blankets...Save your money and please invest in something that will enhance your sleeping experience.. after this bad purchase experience I went to a Sears store in close to my home and purchased a nice blanket :-)  and love it",1
316,Not OXO quality. When I thought of OXO I though of great grips.  Nice soft quality weighty feel.  When I got this corkscrew I was shocked to find out that it was flimsy black plastic.  Looks like OXO in the picture but it is nothing more then cheap plastic bits.  OXO degraded their name with this product,1
317,"a waste of money. I had a Hoover Windtunnel Supreme bagged upright vacuum in 2000.  It worked very well until sometime in 2003, when I replaced it.  I have a dog and two cats, so I need a good vacuum.   I replaced it with highly rated vacuum, that also worked well for three years until it started going downhill.   So I got another Hoover Windtunnel Supreme Bagged Upright.This new on is a piece of junk.  I've had it two months, gone through 2 belts, and I'm ready to throw it in the garbage.  It's lighter weight than the last one, and doesn't seem to work as well.  It doesn't even hold together well - for example, the end keeps coming off of the handle as I vacuum.Did I mention it just doesn't work very well?  Because it really doesn't.",1
318,"Just as good as the price !. Pros:1.) Cheap2.) Looks PrettyCons:1.) Polyester - Not good to sleep in. Buy this only if you want to use it for decorating a bedroom/guestroom. Polyester fabric feels rough and coarse and is not at all worthy to sleep on.2.) Less thread countOverall, its just as good as the money it asks for !If you want to have a good sleep, then spend some more money on a 100% cotton comforter.All the comforters from Malibu seem to have the same properties",1
319,"Didn't work at all. One of my cats peed on a pair of leather shoes. I soaked the shoes for a half hour (figured what did I have to lose?), let them dry, they still smelled. I soaked them again, using the remainder of the gallon jug, this time for an hour, they still smell. Good luck with the ""guarantee"" printed on the bottle. I have called customer service 4 times over the past week and was on hold for over 20 minutes each time, and gave up. I e-mailed them three days ago - no answer. So, don't plan on getting your $ back if this doesn't work for you",1
320,"""Stainless"" Steel. Though this item may be a piece of junk, I just wanted to clarify something for everyone. Steel will always rust, even the ""stainless"" steels. However, it is more resistant to rusting so long as you care for the item. For example: Dont leave in a the sink for too long, dont leave it outside in the rain or a puddle of water because it will rust.",1
321,"A Lesson Learned....... Being lost without a timer for everything!, I purchased this to replace one that jumped into the dishpan......  Having a clock and the ability to time three events at once are great features, but the alarm is too soft. I have hearing problems, but even at a distance to 12-15 inches, the alarm is easy to miss.  Even my sharp eared children agree.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.... a lesson learned for me.",1
322,same problem. Bought two spoons and within 2 months both had split along the glue lines.  The spoons were hand washed.  Get spoons but I can't afford to replace them every two months,1
323,Handles and temperature knob cracked and falling off!!. I only have used this about 8 times for just my husband and myself.  I took it out yesterday and the temperature knob fell off in two pieces in my hand.  Then I noticed the handles are all cracked and ready to come apart.  VERY DANGEROUS.  This gets very hot and if lifted it would cause a real problem,1
324,"Nice design, poor materials. I purchased this coffee grinder in July of 2003.  I love the design and the color matches our other teal accented kitchen items perfectly.  It does a decent job of ginding coffee, but after only 5 months, of once a day use, it started to develop vertical stress cracks in the plastic casing around the top.  As of right now (January 2004), more cracks have developed and the initial cracks have become even longer (going down below the interior stainless steel &quot;bowl&quot;).  Because of all the cracks, the lid now fits very loosely, and I'm afraid that with more use, the cracks will continue to extend downward, rendering the entire unit unusable.  The stainless steel cased version may be the way to go, but since we don't have any stainless steel accessories in our kitchen, I will be replacing my grinder with another brand",1
325,"So-so dry vac, not so great wet vac. We bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from Amazon last year, and absolutely love it. After that positive experience, we were looking for something for our kitchen, bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner.Starting with the dry vac part, that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine, but anything Cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back. Which would be fine, but if you lean it back too far, there is a suction filter thing (made for the wet vac part) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue. Anyway, the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well, but if any of you have small children (we have 3 boys under 6), don't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes.Now, onto the wet vac part, which was the main reason we got this. Very disappointing. We used the included cleaner, warm tap water, etc as the directions indicated, and both my wife and I swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started. It doesn't look cleaner, shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean. Spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine. We bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors, and I can honestly say that this machine did not do either.As briefly noted above, if you have children, do not expect clean floors out of this, and I can't recommend this at all. This product may be suitable for people who have no children, no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic; I just know this isn't our house",1
326,"DeLonghi won't stand behind their workmanship!. Although their coffeemakers do an excellent job of making coffee, DeLonghi WILL USE ANY EXCUSE NOT TO HONOR THE WARRANTY IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG! Here's my experience: When I ordered my coffeemaker from DeLonghi, it was ""backordered"" and took over a month to ship. A little over 10 months after I received it, the coffeemaker broke! (The heater coil went out and it would no longer make coffee.) Since it had been over a year since I ORDERED it, they said the one-year warranty was expired, despite the fact I had proof I had received it less than a year before (I still had the shipping confirmation). I explained this numerous times. For a couple of months, the various people I talked to kept telling me they would ""look into it"", but they never called back. Finally, when it actually WAS over a year since I had received the coffeemaker, when I called to check on the status of my warranty claim, they said, ""Your warranty has expired. You've had this coffeemaker over one year. There is nothing we can do."" I highly recommend you find a coffeemaker from a manufacturer that stands behind their product! I have a Cuisinart now, and it is WONDERFUL!",1

329,"replacement filter does not perform like original. The original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms.  This replacement filter, however, does not seem to wick water very well.  It can barely keep a 17x12' room at 30% humidity with the door closed, windows shut and heat turned off.  And it's in the 40s -- not even very cold out.  In fact, it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank I have to flip the filter every hour or so.  I called Hamilton Beach but they said it wasn't their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3M.  Of course, this is the only filter offered for use with this unit",1
330,"Very Disappointing. I had never heard of Bamboo Cutting Boards and was impressed by the pictures and advertisements posted on Amazon.com. In addition, in person the wood grain and various interlaying colors of this item are truly beautiful.  However, I was very disappointed in the quality of the craftsmanship.  Some of the various seams between the wooden pieces in the cutting board had large open gaps while others exposed wood glue that had leaked out and dried.  It also appeared as though during manufacturing some gaps in the wood were filled with glue or sealant, creating an unsightly blemish on the item.  Even more noticeable were 1/2-inch areas located in various spots around both sides of the cutting block that appeared to be rough or un-sanded/unfinished exposed wood. I do not recommend purchasing this item through the internet.",1
331,"These shears don't cut it. The first use wasn't too bad. It cut things well but the lock locks too easily, without something even touching it, so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use. Safety is nice,but that is just annoying.The biggest problem is the coil/spring is NOT stainless-steel so the inside of it rusts, even if you take it apart for each washing. Once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult toclose the shears, making cutting a real pain, literally. I soak the spring regularly in rust remover but I can not use it no more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand.My prior shears lasted for 10 years, but these I need to replace after a couple of months..",1
332,Cheap garbage Not cheap price!!. Buyer beware!! Don't bother buying this. Terrible quality. If you bought one at a local dollar store you would be better off and a lot easier on your wallet.,1
333,"Does not work in extremely dry homes!. I bought this unit because the humidity in my apartment on extremely dry days and nights was 15-20%.  The Air-O-Swiss 7135 was rated top by every web site I visisted and researced before buying this product.  It is also rated to work in rooms up to 600 square feet, and the biggest room in my apartment is less than 500.  Well to summerize:- hygrostat consistently says 25% even though my bedside hygo says 15%.  The best I can get out of this machine is 30% humidity according to my own hygostat, as the one built into the unit does not move past 25%.-  the above situation is in the smallest room in my home, which is 170 square feet, so the 600 square feet rating is totally not true.To close, please be ware that this unit does not work for extremely dry apartments and homes like mine.  The other reviews must be in homes that are already at 30-40% humidity.  This is not worth the money you pay for it.  I will try running it non-stop for a few days to see if it helps, but if not then this unti will be going back.",1
334,"Very unsatisfied. Just bought this thing...filled it up once - worked great - had to fill it up again and it's so awkward to hold - it slipped and cracked completely.

336,"Didn't last long:  BAD service. This was a fine machine until 2 months after the warranty ran out.  Then I began to get a ERR 6 error.  Cleared the thread, still no luck.  I took the machine to a Brother certified service center.  They advised they couldn't find anything wrong, except that it didn't work and could not help any further.  They advised to return it to the manufacturer.  When I called Brother, they advised my only alternative was to take it to another Factory Service Center.  I did, same story.  It appears that neither Brother or their Factory Service Centers care if their products stop working once the warranty runs out.  That type of service I can do without.  This one went into the trash, a $180 lesson in what brand NOT to buy.  I don't yet know what my replacement will be but it will absolutely not be a Brother",1

341,"troublesome. The poaching cups are small. It took several tries to learn to make eggs that didn't spill over; sometimes I had egg white in strings all over the machine when it was done. If you buy smaller eggs it helps.Now that the machine is a year old or so, it has started malfunctioning. The buzzer keeps going off as the eggs are cooking; I think the lid has gotten just warped enough that a seal isn't quite forming? For whatever reason, the machine keeps on thinking it is done, buzzing, and shutting down, so that I have to stand over it pressing down and trying to shift the way the lid fits on. It works well some days and gives me fits other days.I don't know if we put the parts in the dishwasher or if it's just a troublesome little machine; but if you have multiple family members taking turns washing dishes you may not have control over whether the egg machine gets warped.When it works, it's a favorite kitchen gadget--and I'm NOT fond of gadgets",1

343,"BEWARE.  Sharp metal spikes inside the docks!. Firstly, this product is useless as is - the dock will not stay above water.  You must silicone it to your tank for it to remain stable.That being said, it is inappropriate for this usage as well.  It is made of styrofoam which a turtle with claws will rip apart (and will eat the pieces.)  My adult RES broke off the entire corner of the dock and there was a LARGE METAL SPIKE PROTRUDING pointing in the exact direction the turle climbs from.  I suppose this is the inner armature - it is not a blunt-edge metal wire, which would be dangerous enough, but a thick VERY SHARP spike.  I actually broke skin by touching it while trying to photograph it (sending a letter to the company.)I consider myself very lucky that my turtle did not impale himself.  Stay away from this product.  If you would like a ramp, I suggest getting a piece of cork bark and siliconing it to your tank",1

It is also made in Korea unlike the other All Clad products which are made in the USA. Shop around there are better products out there for half the price,1
345,"Bad supplier. I would not buy Sango products from Amazon if I were you.  Their supplier is terrible.  There is nothing wrong with Sango products, it is just that Amazon and the supplier do not care about product quality or customer happiness.The first set that I received had bubbles in the glaze and it was easy to send it back.  However, the second set I received came broken.  Things like this do happen in the mail, but what upset me was the fact that there were wrapped up pieces and notes from a previous customer.  What this told me was that the supplier was sending out already returned broken items and trying to pass them off as new.  I brought this to Amazon's attention twice and all I received was a generic response.  I recommend you buy your Sango products elsewhere",1
346,"RUST on bottom appeared after first use!!!. I was disappointed by this toothbrush holder after putting it to use for just one day - any drops of water that run down the side of the holder or end up around the bottom edge due to splashing/runoff from the bathroom sink immediately seem to trigger the bottom of the holder to rust! I tried to keep the splashing to a minimum but this thing started leaving a rust-ring on my bathroom counter within a couple days. I still use it since it's a nice-looking & easily cleaned toothbrush holder but I keep a coaster under it to protect the sink/counter. I wish I could give it more stars since I love the look & functionality of it but I have to give it only 2 stars since I think making it rust-proof is only common sense for something that sits next to your sink. I wonder if all the steeltek ""stainless-steel"" products rust so easily??",1

There's NO stainless-steel steamer basket included and the instruction manual states that this pressure cooker is NOT dish-washer safe.

I can't believe that I will probably put up with this for years as I use my microwave several times a day.  My husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons.  Seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input.  Like Power buttons in the upper left corner.  Most-used buttons should be large.  maybe in a special color.  I like the web 2.0 look that is developing on user interfaces.  No user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought.  I asked my husband what was the brand name and he said ""Sharp"" so even if cheap I think Sharp ought to protect the brand image.

351,"Too small for a betta. Caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper.In a small bowl like this, the fish's waste will build up rapidly (espcially since there is no filter). This causes suffering (for example, eye and skin irritation), sickness, and even death. You can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently; however, frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish. (Not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper!)In addition, the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly; another source of stress for the fish. You cannot use a heater in a bowl this small.Bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to 80F; there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons.If you'd like to care for a fish, please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can. (Ignore manufacturers websites, since of course they will say their products are great, even crummy products like this one.) Get the largest tank you can afford. If you can't afford a large enough tank, please don't get the fish.",1

Yet it died off at the first time I used it-rather tried to use it. It was on just for 20 mins, not continuously though. I had already emptied the bag for two times and my back was virtually broken when I used it. Anyway, if anyone from the Euro-Pro is reading the reviews on this product, they should recompensate all of us because I believe marketing such a product is kind of abusing customers!

355,Does not work more than 1 foot away. I just got this from Amazon - working on returning there is no range between the PAW and doorbell chime. Even at 2 - 3 feet away with brand new batteries it seems to have issues. I thought it would be more usable than a hanging bell and easier to install with less holes and hardware. The PAW is more like a toy so you have to mount it and since there is no range u have to mount the reciever directly above it. With the range of the one I have it would of made sense to combine the two,1

The entire drawer (left side of hutch) was missing, the hardware was missing, and the assembly instructions were missing. ...

I would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from All-Clad, but the sad truth is that I have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer, and a small fraction of the cost.  After just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food - ick!  I love the uncoated All-Clad, but I will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future",1

Why the two stars? We wanted to love this machine! We wanted it to work! It is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree (a Mr. Coffee!). The clock is nice. The thermal carafe is lovely. Until the BIG LEAK, we made do with its daily dribble and sputter. But really, after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can, we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did. That's why I've bothered to write this review. It is not an inexpensive machine; the quality isn't there. Sorry.",1

374,"Cute, but poor quality. I have to start by saying that this is a review for the sheets only, not the whole set.  But since no one else has yet to review the whole set, I felt compelled to educate buyers on at least half of what they were purchasing. :o)I bought this sheet set for my toddler because they look so adorable, and they are. They're vibrant. But when I first openened the package, I was disappointed to feel how uncomfortable they were.Naturally, I hoped that they would soften up after a few washes...but after 5 washes, they still felt rough. And to add insult to injury, the elastic edge on the bottom sheet started to unravel and create a 4 inch hole.I'm no expert on thread count when it comes to sheets, but I would guess that these are around 100. The weave is so loose that you can see through the sheets and it reminds me of gauze.It's a shame that they are of such poor quality b/c I really do love the pattern. I ended up just making curtains out of mine.Although not advertised in the description here, the tag on my sheets say Dan River and I noticed that this company produces a lot of the cute sheets for Star Wars. So I'd say that there is a good chance that many of the Dan River sheets are made with the same quality, although I don't know for sure",1
375,"Nice as a one season sheet set. I have to admit that I love this set. Especially since I found it hard to find white flannel sheets. Most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen! So when I found these and at this price I was quite happy. They feel great, not the best flannel but nice all the same. But after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore. Later the fitted started getting holes. So since this was rather cheap I am not horribly sad about it. So if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning, this is the set for you",1

Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product.If you decide to purchase Super Bark Free, be sure it's returnable for a full refund if it doesn't live up to its claims. And in the meantime, shop around for a more effective product",1
377,"What was Hoover thinking?  Messy!. The vacuum has great suction.  However, suction is the only good quality about this vacuum.I purchased this vacuum at Sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale.  But I have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one.  The 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter, the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break.  The 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off.This vacuum is hard to push.  You have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting. On hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too!This vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections. The small compartment in the back of the dust cup is (1"" high X 5"" wide X 6"" deep) for the dirt.  The large front section collects the hair, crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home, however dirt and fine particulate dust is what I collect in my vacuum, and Hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter.  You spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet. Today I had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter. Even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out.  Yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up.I have tried Kenmore, Eureka, and Fantom in the past. I plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once I get my Dyson I purchased from HSN",1

It should be noted that a)The pans were NEVER left soaking in water or in the sink b)There was not ANYTHING even the TINIEST bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have ""rubbed off"" rust onto them or anything like that.

It does not have an element that radiates heat so there isn't a lot of heat for the fan to send out.  I would honestly recommend spending a little more and going for a larger unit.

It has too many pieces to clean, and worst of all, the sleeve does not remain securely attached to the the metal steam pipe.  Several times I've had the frother explode off the machine in a cloud burst of half-steamed milk that sprayed all over the kitchen.  I've had various other problems with this complicated design.  In fact, the company provides a detailed, additional page of instructions on how to troubleshoot with the frother sleeve, which suggests to me that the company is already aware that the design is flawed.  I have to ask the question: why not produce a simple, metal frother that doesn't break and require such special care?This is the second Gaggia machine that I have purchased this year (the previous was a full automatic with a faulty sensor), and this is the second Gaggia that has left me disappointed.  I agree that the espresso quality is very good - but I remain underwhelmed for the prices I've paid, given the design flaws I've encountered",1

390,"Aesthetically pleasing, but too heavy. I must say I'm a big fan of Calphalon.  I own several pots and pans from both their tri-ply stainless steel and non-stick contemporary series and I love them and highly recommend them.I bought these knives assuming that their quality in cookware would translate into cutlery.  I ended up returning them after several days... here's why.PROS:Absolutely beautiful knives that are well crafted with very rigid stainless steel (more rigid than Henckels and Wustof).  The Santoku knife is a nice addition.  I loved that the steel construction went all the way to the end of the handle.  The steel provided with the set supposedly actually SHARPENS the knives as opposed to only HONING them.  Who knows.CONS:1. Very heavy.  Compared to the German knives, these are not agile at all and can be painful on the wrists especially when using the very substantive chef's knife.  I thought the weight would add to the cutting ease but it really did not.  On top of that, the weight was unevenly distributed making the knives feel unbalanced.2. Short handles.  As you progress to the smaller knives, the handles got annoying short.  This just compounded the weight issue.3. No sharpness advantage.  I ended up purchasing the Henckels twin cuisine set of knives as they were similar in design (and also has a Santoku in the set!) to the Katana series.  I noticed that even though the ""VG Japanese steel"" was supposed to be even sharper and stronger than the German steel, I felt like the Henckels knives were still sharper and cut through everything with much more ease.4. Slightly harder to clean.  The integrated bolster design makes it slightly hard to clean since any sponge you use against the blade tends to snag on the sharp end of the bolster.  All the other German knives have a rounded bolster.  This is by far the least important con.All in all, I think the Henckels Twin Cuisine knife set is extremely similar in price and design, and additionally does not suffer from the deficiencies of the Katana Series knives",1

392,"2 1/2 Stars ~ Good concept, Poor excecution. Got this tea kettle for a gift recently.  It's discontinued on Amazon but they sell it at Home Goods for $ 24. 99.PROS ~* Asthetically pleasing (looks pretty)* Removable top for wide area to fill with water AND makes it easier to wash* Removable whistle (I can't stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle, so I remove the ""plug"")CONS ~* It'd be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up ""plug"" on the spout instead of the removable one (I'll lose it eventually, the other Le Creuset models have the flip up ""plug"" that opens with a press of the thumb)* The poor design of the spout is dangerous.  No matter how slowly I pour the boiling water (even with the small amount I use, only 4 or 6 ounces at a time), a few tablespoons of water ""blub"" out very quickly - sorry I can't think of a better descriptive word.  The spout opening is WAY too small, but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water, so the first few tablespoons GUSH out.  So when you pour the water, do it as slowly as possible, put the mug on your counter or another surface that won't get ruined when wet, and don't hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the ""blub"" of boiling water will burn",1

It formed tiny lumps before it melted and after it cooled to 85 I poured into molds. It never set fully, most stuck in the molds and others went crumbley. Instructions have you melt and cool to 85 only, nothing about cooling and then reheating to 85 as it says on this site. I also melted some yogurt coating which worked fine other than the fact you could only fill to a certain line although you could keep adding as it melted.

414,"Too flimsy!   Light also not that bright. Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light",1

The reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product.  Among her pet peeves:* things do stick to the product - use a flour cooking spray for better results.* odors do stay with the product* not easy to clean - the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps.* size of the pieces are small* the pieces are so flexible that if you don't place the food neatly in the pan, you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results.* you can slice through the product easily.* guarantee is shakey at best* and so on.....There are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light.And more importantly, I personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis.

I called Oneida and they are willing to replace the pieces that are a problem but the same thing keeps happening.  Oneida said that if you have hard water where you live then this can happen.  I had an oneida set prior to this one that I had for 8 years and this never happened.   I would not recommend this flatware to anyone.  The more they get washed in the dishwasher the more it starts to rust.  Very disappointed and surprised in the poor quality of this flatware",1
428,"I'm Steamed!. I have really enjoyed the quality of all of my other Cuisinart cookware.  Unfortunately, this tea kettle does not belong in the otherwise excellent product line.  The kettle's shape makes it very difficult to pour.  The handle conveys all of the heat of the boiling water, so you are not able to touch the handle without a hot pad.  I have given up using the whistle attachment for two reasons:  first, it is not made of Cuisinart's stainless steel (it appears to be made of plastic with a silver plastic coating), and so it has cracked and peeled from the heat; and second, it is impossible to remove the whistle when the kettle is hot so you are unable to pour your boiling water (often all that comes off when attempting to remove the whistle is the decorative ball on its tip!).  I really wish that I had returned this tea kettle",1

I use my grinder every day and I like a lot of pepper.  I found this grinder to be a pain because of how light the output was-- I had to sit there squeezing for what felt like ages.  In addition, the grind isn't adjustable, although it was supposed to be.  Finally, the handle simply broke off one day.  I didn't drop it or anything.  I guess it's not for serious use.",1

When I first put the stopper in the bottle, it was loose, although when I opened it a few days later, the seal was enough to cause it to break (with a weak pull). It also adds about an inch to the bottle height which could cause storage problems. I recommend a stopper that has a lever on top that fits the stopper to the bottle opening (and also doesn't add as much height).

437,Disappointed. I bought this fryer 3 months ago and was thrilled with it at first. It has all the features I was looking for-- in particular that it was fully washable and it had a drain spout. The only thing I didn't like was that the temperature selections were pre-set and I couldn't vary  the temp to EXACTLY what I wanted. It wasn't that big of a deal though. But after using the machine about a month I started getting an error message on the LED screen and the machine would shut off. I always reset it pretty quickly so I could continue to use it. The messages came more and more often and today I cannot use the machine at all-- it instantly goes to the error message and I cannot use it and I cannot cook my lunch the way I wanted to. I'm very disappointed that this machine didn't even last me 3 whole months.

Neither the Anolon box nor the outer UPS shipping carton showed any damage when I received the skillet.  It wasn't until the the following day, after I threw out the packaging, that I noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly.

The plastic was molded poorly, so mine never connects and can't lock properly. Hence, trying to pick the unit up results in the thing falling apart. I lived with this for a month or so. The bag ran out, so I had to buy a replacement. The bag replacement is so poorly designed that turning the wheel never exerts enough force to pull out any more bag.

468,"Not so hot. Although it is effective as any similar heater, it has some annoying design features.  The display only stays on for a few seconds after changing a setting.  I don't know why it can't stay on all the time.  Like it isn't running on batteries after all.  Its bright red pilot light stays on as long as it's plugged in but there are no indicators to tell you if it is on, off, or on thermostat.  You would have to walk over to it, bend down, and attempt to read the dark display to figure that out (you might need a flashlight).  They foolishly use the same button to start the oscillation and turn it on and off.  To turn it off you have to hold the button down for several seconds (a short tap starts it oscillating).  Fortunately I have found a quicker way to turn it off.  I just tip it enough to engage the tip-over safety switch and it goes right off.  Much quicker than holding down the stupid button.  If you're not easily annoyed, you might like this heater",1

However, this time I was putting together a black bean soup and as I scraped the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, I became aware something had happened.  A day or so later, as I took all the soup out to transfer to a bowl, there on the bottom of this pan was all the enamel coming off in big pieces.  I couldn't believe it!

I read the other reviews of this coffeemaker, plus many other, plus a list by someone named Neil (I believe) and even he recommended anything by Zojirushi over many more recognizable names.  I fell for the ""rave"" reviews.  I ordered.  It arrived two days ago and was taken back to UPS the next day for return.  Complete disappointment - main reason - coffee not hot, and I mean NOT HOT, not even lukewarm (hardly) when cream was added.  Someone had mentioned (and it was in the attending info booklet) about warming up your cup before pouring.  My husband thought this absolutely absurd and said that before he would have to go to so much trouble just to have a nice, hot cup of coffee with his morning paper, he would just do without.  I did like the size, the simplicity of operation,(reason for the two stars) though some features that would have been nice were missing (and I already knew this when ordering) - no automatic shut-off, for one.  The price was excessive (nearly $75.00 with shipping) which was nearly nine dollars to get here and had to pay another nine to send it back.  $18.00 down the drain and still have to look further for a coffeemaker that will actually make HOT coffee.  I am not talking about scalding here, just good and hot, adequate enough to still remain hot after cream is added.  Have been told one of the coffeemakers - Cuisinart Brew General (I believe that is the name, spelling probably wrong) that was ""bad-mouthed"" by this fellow with the list of recommended coffeemakers, would be an excellent choice.  Two people I have found today who have it, and say it produces HOT coffee.

483,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. But it makes coffee. First the bad news -- the Amazon product description is misleading. Well, flat-out wrong, in fact. This coffeemaker doesn't come with a thermal carafe. In reality, the carafe is very thin aluminum, like lightweight metal cookware that you buy for backpacking. So -- not just not thermal, but this sucker gets HOT when it's full of fresh coffee.Also, it doesn't have a ""permanent filter."" It has a standard plastic swing-out filter basket, and comes with a reusable nylon filter. Nothing wrong with that (it's nice to get one packaged with the machine, actually) but the above description of a ""permanent stainless-steel filter basket"" isn't accurate.The water tank maxes out at 28 oz., which is enough for two big (16 oz.) mugs at my house. Since I'm the only coffee drinker, this is fine.On the other hand, it was as inexpensive as it is cheaply made. Despite the ridiculous, deliberately misleading retail price listed (as of March '07 as I write this, it says it retails for $85.99!) I got it for ten bucks plus shipping, and it's worth about that. Add shipping cost, and it was under $20, and it's programmable. It's worth noting that the programmable function turns off the hot plate after two hours, but if you use the coffeemaker manually you have to remember to turn it off yourself so that you don't, I assume, melt the cheap metal carafe.It looks nice on the counter. It makes coffee. For me, it's a perfectly acceptable replacement coffeemaker that I bought on the spur of the moment when my previous machine broke -- but that's all it is, a temporary replacement. In this case, you get what you pay for, and I'm saving my pennies to get a better coffeemaker in a couple of months",1

The whole concept of this toy was great but they should've expanded their ideas a bit more. For the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does. I'm not sure about others but most cats I know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser, maybe even jump up the wall. As opposed to with the Bada Beam that just goes in a circle, reversing its direction every once in awhile. My cat never avoids the laser pointer, when he sees that red light he jumps right up! But with the Bada Beam, he will just sit and stare at it. The whole point is so that you don't have to hold it and let the cats go crazy! NOPE! It's one thing for me to be disappointed, but it's clear that my cat was more disappointed.",1

After receiving it, I changed my mind.  Although it promises to be an easy cleanup with a ""special tool"", it is way too hard to clean up.  The pulp basket contains a ridge that makes it next to impossible to get out all of the little strains of pulp.  The special tool is great for getting out the big stuff, but not the little stuff.  Also, there is a TON of juice left over in the pulp that gets thrown away.  This is a result of the poor design, which filters the juice through the pulp before exiting.  The product had a nice design and looked good on my counter-top, but it did not deliver.  I would recommend buying Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer that is available on other sites",1

By then we were under a time crunch so I talked to customer service but there was no way Target would expedite shipping the correct item to arrive in time.  I had to order the item from another supplier and pay for 2 day delivery.In the meantime, the online pathway for getting a shipping label to return the wrong item lets me spend time putting all the information in but then shuttles me to a ""Try again"" screen.  I try half a dozen or more times and give up.  An hour later I try again with the same dead end.  I email customer service to just send a label by email but have yet to receive a response.  The next day I try again with the same dead end.  I have wasted a lot of time for something I don't even want.  I think I will let my credit card company know to not pay, and let the supplier ship me a return label when they get around to it.Can you tell I am not impressed with the 'service'",1

As soon as I set it up and turned it on, I noticed a loud cracking sound coming from the unit, about every 10 seconds or so. I looked inside the unit and a visible blue spark could be seen.  It appeared that either the product had a problem with a fuse or a bad connection inside the unit. Luckily, I was home when this happened- what if the spark had caused a fire? I returned the product immediately and have since bought another air purifier.  This one is not worth the money and is a huge safety hazard!",1

I am so disappointed by the quality of construction that it's going right back in the box and back to the merchant.  The door is not square with the frame and jiggles back and forth on its hinges, the pushbuttons are cheap chrome-plated plastic with dimples in the middle from a shoddy molding process, and the control panel label is stick-on vinyl that doesn't fit properly and is already beginning to peel up.  The stainless steel cabinet is so thin, I can see dents in the side where the screws go in.  I'm surprised Farberware has put their name on such a piece of junk",1

It was very loud, so much that it scares the dickens out of the cats, but it worked well until three months ago.That's when its suction was working less and less. I kept thinking, ""Wow, I have to vacuum more often, maybe the cats are shedding,"" or ""I can't believe how dirty we've been lately."" As it turns out, the vacuum wasn't really picking up items so much as it was either redistributing them around the carpet, or collecting them in the nozzle. As soon as I'd turn it off to store it, things came out all over the place.I'm frustrated to have to buy yet another vacuum in less than a year's time.   No more Dirt Devils for me",1

512,"Didn't work for me, but your mileage may vary. I bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor's mutt.  The offending dog is often left on the neighbor's porch, where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by.Before ordering, I had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect.  In my case, the neighbor's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine.  Unfortunately, this was not ""too close for comfort"" as far as the dog was concerned.Having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices, I was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working.  Alas, it did not.  Some dogs just don't hear them.  In my case, it was probably due at least in part to the distance.My suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target.  If it doesn't work, go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what I did).  By the way, you don't need an RA (AKA RMA) number to return the device.  Just send it to the company along with your receipt, and a note saying that you would like a refund (not an exchange).(...)  I sympathize with anyone having this problem, and wish you all the best of luck.  No one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason, and the argument that ""dogs bark"" simply does not hold any water",1

515,"Hate this coffeemaker. I've had this coffeemaker for two weeks. I bought it because I had an old Mr. Coffee that worked fine, but was white and stained.  I liked that this was black and looked sleek.  The very second time I used it, the off button stuck, so you can no longer turn off the machine, but have to wait for it to turn itself off.  Also, EVERY pot has grounds in it.  I'm using the filters that came with it, and have never even filled it to capacity, and I can't figure out why there are ALWAYS grounds in my coffee.

521,"Nice product but doesn't fit as advertised. I bought this double boiler specifically for my 2 1/2qt Calphalon Professional Saucepan thinking it would fit together nicely as it was advertised ""fits all Calphalon Professional and Commercial 2 1/2qt saucepans"".  Wrong.  Not only is there a decent sized gap around the edges where the double boiler pan should snuggly meet the saucepan, but the bottom of the double boiler sits directly on the bottom of the saucepan, not allowing for any water barrier, and essentially, defeating the purpose of using a double boiler.  I'm very disappointed.  The product itself is well made and feels quite durable and sturdy but it was mismatched with my saucepan. I mistakenly threw out the packaging before realizing this and am now unable to return it....anyone need a double boiler pan and want to take a gamble that it will fit your saucepan?",1

524,"Worthless trash. The item arrived fine and intact, but upon opening the box I found myself staring at what I can only assume is someone's sick and twisted joke.  I spent 45 minutes trying to ""assemble"" the rack, with the side pegs falling out on me every time I tried to put another piece in place.  I finally got down to the bottom and the last side and noticed the piece meant for the bottom is curved in a way that makes it impossible to put in place.  I'd attempt to bend it straight but it seems about as brittle as dead tree bark.  I finally just figured with a bottom that brittle it would be all of a week before it was broken anyway and threw it in the trash, which is where it belongs I feel",1
525,"A piece of junk. I'm astonished at the good reviews this appliance has accrued, the primary reason that I bought it. It's possible that mine was a dud but just about everything was wrong with it. Once you plug the appliance in, the red light is supposed to go on. Mine never did. The appliance smoked so heavily that the smoke alarm went off in the apartment. The manual warns of ""slight smoke and odor"" upon first use. The smoking never stopped. Since I had already taken the trouble and prepared a waffle mix, I decided to remain undaunted. The green light is supposed to go on when the waffle/sandwich maker is pre-heated. Mine did not go on. 20 minutes later, with smoke billowing all around I decided that the green light was not about to give me the go ahead and I should assume that the appliance had pre-heated. Somewhat daunted but still determined (with the family now desperate for breakfast) I decided to lay on the mixture. No lights to tell me when I could expect results, no automatic shut-off switch, so 2 minutes later I opened the lid and peered inside. Nada. Nothing. Still runny. I shut the contraption and waited again. I lifted the lid on and off several times over a period of 10 minutes. Finally the waffles looked done so I tried to prise them off. Sorry! The waffle maker seemed too fond of its waffles to give them up.  I took a sharp knife to them and and tried to yank them off. I was rewarded with waffle shreds. I tried to lift off the waffle pan entirely so I could attack it in a more convenient location. Instead, it attacked me. What looks like safety handles on the sides are not safety handles at all. OUCH! Burns! Yeah, if I wasn't so dignified, I'd be sueing a particular company. Bruised, hurting and irritated, I was still not about to give up. I allowed the pans to cool. I washed them out. I doused them (literally) with cooking spray. I tried again. This time it worked. The waffles tasted fine except by now it was lunch and I'd already depleted  the mixture in failed attempts. It still took about 10 mins to bake 2 waffles...  I'm returning the appliance to Amazon today. I'd love to pay more and get a really high-end waffle/sandwich maker but there seems to be nothing in the market. The way to go is to buy separate gadgets methinks.",1
526,"Why?. Why would you use this item when any type of ball works?  Tennis balls are my choice, and they can even be spritzed with some fragrance",1
527,"Poor Quality. The pitcher is made from poor quality materials. We have two pitchers and have never washed them in the dishwasher. In less than a year, both pitchers cracked along the seam that runs from the spout down the side of the pitcher. If we attempt to use them, tea immediately leaks all over the counter. Since other pitchers are not compatible with the machine, our ice tea maker is useless. We have owned two previous Mr. Coffee Ice Tea models in the past ten years. The pitchers lasted for several years before eventually cracking. Mr. Coffee chose to use inferior materials with this model. I am very disappointed in the quality and will never trust their company again. I am now searching for an ice tea maker that uses quality materials",1
528,"Disappointment. I've had two of these now, and they both had one serious flaw: the trumpeted ""brew and pause"" feature DOES NOT WORK.  Pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it weren't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up.Also, it's hard not to spill some water on the heating plate, either during filling or brewing, creating a consequent sizzling sound that adds a lot of ambience -- if you live in a steak house.Considering how many other coffee makers are available out there, these flaws make this machine a mistake.Too bad, because some things are done quite nicely: the controls are good and easy to set, and the overall styling is sleek, euro-cool, and compact.  Unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps, the water filters do about as much as a rain dance.Pass on this one",1
529,"The ""Everything Sticks"" Griddle. I bought this griddle under the impression that it was non-stick - it is everything but that.  I only cook with butter (no sprays), but that does not matter.  Even with butter the eggs stick every time.  Even pancakes stick.  This is the worst grill I have ever used",1
530,"defective unit returned. I was very disappointed with this machine. My brand new X5 leaked water from the first day. Talked to the company's US service center (don't bother email, she will just tell you to call and it is a one person operation); service center person said it was probably a gasket and that she would send a replacment, but they were on backorder. Makes you think they are having other problems besides me! Also, I found the product manual to be poor (why does it take THREE manuals, plus 1 photocopied insert to find the information you need to set up?). The crema was dark, but that may have had more to do with the leakage of water.It is a pretty machine, but nothing else was pleasing about it.Update: Six weeks later, the company sent a replacement washer for me to repair the machine with. Of course, I had long since returned it to Amazon, who quickly credited my card.",1
531,"Try before you buy. This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee.That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives",1

533,"Loud and obnoxious. After returning my first L'equip because the blade assembly broke, my second blender showed up after a long wait. Like the first one, it is obnoxiously loud and doesn't do a good job of mixing anything but liquids. It has a hard time with bananas. To me, it sounds like it's broken and I feel like it probably will soon. The RPM meter is just an electrical current meter for the motor, so it doesn't accurately count RPMs--it's just for show. Maybe I got unlucky twice, but otherwise, I can't see what all the 4 stars are about",1

It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap).  However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes.  It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart.

542,"Terrible Packaging!!!!. The item itself was lovely and of good quality, the problem was most definitely the poor packaging. The beautiful metal cradle that is included rattled around and dented and even chipped the wooden bowl multiple times. I ordered this product twice even giving the reason for my return of the first salad bowl. The second one I received was packaged even worse. This was very inconvenient since it was to be a Christmas gift. I suspected it the second time so I asked the UPS guy to stay til I looked at the item itself. Lo and behold it was once again damaged and I sent it on its way on the spot. Anyone ordering this product I advise you to do the same! This situation forced me to do what I was trying to avoid, last minute holiday rush traffic jams everywhere shopping",1
543,"Assault on the Environment!. This hamper is okay, but Amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it.  I ordered four, and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse.  How did they arrive?  In four giant shipping boxes; each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags!  It took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags.  I live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce, and this really an insult to me and to the environment.  There is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper.  According to the packing list, the shipping cost on each was $6, which means that due to Supersaver, Amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of $5 per hamper.

548,"Avoid this one. My mother-in-law bought this to make coffee for visitors. It worked fine at first but, after one or two months of use, started to experience water leaks of increasing severity. At first there were drips outside of the carafe. Then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints. We put the whole machine on a metal tray--to make clean-up easier. Finally it got so bad that, fearing an encounter with boiling hot water and/or the risk of an electrical shock, we stopped using it.In the end, I was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket (it's a circular one-piece with a tiny hole in the middle) from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug. I then inserted a filter, coffee, and poured in hot water from a stove-top kettle. While this sounds ridiculous, it's a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine.My recommendation: avoid this machine. It's disturbing that Black and Decker would produce a product so dangerous and lacking in quality",1

I heard every excuse from they were back-ordered to my order was never received. Friends told me just to go buy a new one because it was the principle of the matter that made me persevere and wait for the recalled part.When the food comes up and simmers, the lid bounces around on top and spews steam, creating quite a mess. I have to wedge a toothpick between the lid and the pot to prevent this from happening. It needs some sort of venting system.The cooking pot itself is rough on the the bottom and has scratched the living daylights out of my stainless steel sink.On the bright side, it does actually cook the food",1

The only way we've been able to unclog the hose is to use water to flush it, which really isn't a good idea, but it's the only way we've been able to get it functional again.  As well, we've had problems with the carpet powerhead and the small upholstery components of the machine--the beater brush does not turn on for some odd reason, but only sometimes.  Another rater stated their machine was ""moody"", and they are correct, as sometimes these two pieces will work, and sometimes they will not.  And the retractable cord?  Forget it retracting after about a dozen uses.  It's a piece of trash and I agree with the rater who stated, ""Hoover should be ashamed of themselves!"".",1

561,Poor Quality. We bought this chair/ottoman about six months ago.  It looks quite nice but we find it pretty uncomfortable and the quality is fairly poor.  The fabric doesn't hold up well - the cushion looks pretty saggy and the fabric is stretched already.  It filled a gap in our living room furniture set-up after we moved into our first house but we're looking at paying some additional money for a hardier piece of furniture and moving this up to our bedroom.It's okay for the price - but nothing to write home about.  We've gotten better quality furniture from Target,1
562,"Terrible can opener. This is the worse can opener I have ever bought.  It has failed four out of 6 times I have used it!!

563,"Don't buy it. I loved the design so decided to buy it, 4 yes 4 coffee makers later in one year, I have given up on getting another one. All of the four have had problems with the electronics.  The coffee will brew and then instead of going to warming, the machine shuts off and and starts blinking as if it is in the timed setting, the clock itself stops competely and the coffe gets cold. The machine is locked in that mode and the only way to get it back out is to unplug it and reset time, timer.  One of the four just completely died after doing the routine once.  At first I could not believe that we got that many lemons so I bought a surge protecter for the outlet, that did not stop it from going into the same routine so I do not believe the cause was other than poor quality.  The warranty is for one year but you have to send the machine to them which involves a shipping expense so beware of that also. There is also a problem with the handle breaking and it does leak ( I would put up with the leak if the thing would just work otherwise",1

The kind of good quality cottons that you get these days is amazing, this blanket is no where near to it.Second, the honeycomb pattern is not well woven, it gets stuck in finger and toe nails and can come off easily.Would never buy this blanket agai",1

The white is a slightly blue-ish white - not at all creamy (if you've been looking at a lot of white dishes you'll appreciate the distinction).  The problem is that the manufacturer or distributor doesn't pack them with enough care.  I ordered two sets to try them out before putting them on my wedding registry. Both arrived with broken bowls.  Then I ordered replacements and one of those arrived broken.  So, after calculating that I'd have to field up to 32 boxes to get 8 intact place settings, I gave up.

580,"Not a true Wusthof! Sharpens into a butter knife!. I should have listened to the reviews! I just received it today and was very excited. But that ended after it dulled my knife.First of all, the instructions sound easy...run your knife across the two ceramic wheels. Several times until your knife it sharp. And wala, your knives are sharp!Not the case for me. I have the Wustof Grand Prix II knives. I was still practicing how to use my honing steel and didn't want to continue putting my knives through my torture training. So I thought I could use this ceramic wheel until I got the hand of the honing steel. I gripped the piece as told, and ran it through with very gentle pressure. Pulling my knife through it was heartbreaking! You could hear the knife resisiting the pull. You'll hear a ""screeching"" sound and NO the ceramic wheels do not move when you are pulling it. The knife just runs on top of where the two wheels connect and you pull. Yes, your knife might scuddle and jump as you pull, it is resisting the sharpener. NO matter how light you pull through!! I never dishwash my knives or let them airdry so you can imagine my dismay. I just thought that is normal. So I stopped running my chef's knife through this and instead, tried my smaller and easily replaceable paring knife. Same thing! Upon closer inspection, you could see curved scratches along the side of the blade! And little knicks along the blade. It made my paring knife dull, after only 3 runs! Very disappointed. The wheels even look like they are about to fall of the piece! The two wheel screws are so loose that with enough pressure for your knife, I am convince it would eventually fall off. Do not buy this! You might as well just run your knife along your steel kitchen sink! ... You'll probably get a sharper edge than this junk! Buy this only if you are stubborn (like I was), and ignored all the reviews and if you have want to junk your good Wusthofs for the super dull supermarket knives. Then go ahead, have fun destroying your knives! Wusthof should be ashamed of themselves to put their quality known name on this piece of JUNK! Now I have to send my knives to Wusthof for sharpening!

It's hard when it's dry but you can get enough grip that it's not to bad, but when it's wet you can't get a grip and it is so hard to get off that it's not worth using.

My second impression is that they might not work as well as I thought they did.I recently bought a water distiller and I have been experimenting with different sources of water in it.  I have used hot water directly from the tap, cold water directly from the tap, and Brita filtered water in the distiller.  The Brita filtered water left the most residue in the distiller, which is very disconcerting.The filters let out small amounts of carbon all the time into the top of their proprietry resevoir.  In the directions, it says to slowly add water to the filtering well, which is what I do, but it still leaches at least thirty little pieces of carbon in the prefiltered water.  I want clean water, not water with small pieces of carbon floating in the filling well.I have always wanted to believe the filters were working, but now am very skeptical.",1

Especially if it's made out of food.  :)  I put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest.  The problem with this toy is that it's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing.  The shape is putting them off.  She later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw, but got so little out of it (a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward) that she lost interest - which is saying a lot, since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb.Finally, I took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs - instand results.  They are working away at them right now.  I think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don't break into pieces easily if they do at all.  Some dogs love this!  Not mine, apparently.So if anyone wants to try it with their dogs, email me.  I have one, never been chewed!  Maybe your dog will like it more than mine.  Five bucks!  ;",1

590,"Not what I expected. I have been looking for one of these for a couple of weeks.  For the price, I thought it would work great.  First, It was the size of a salt shaker (did not read description well enough).  Second, upon first use while trying to apply a coating of powdered sugar on my funnel cake, I thought I was going to throw my shoulder out.  The sugar just will not come out of the fine mesh in the lid.  I had higher hopes for this.  Unfortunately, It is now packaged for a return journey back to Amazon and I am continuing my quest for the perfect funnel cake shaker",1
591,"Good idea, poor engineering. This is a really cool concept, poorly executed.  The clear sleeve slides up and down on an aluminum cylinder.  The top of the cylinder is a rubber gasket that seals the sleeve, thus preventing leakage between the sleeve and the cylinder.  All of that works fine.The problem is that at the bottom of the aluminum cylinder is a plastic ring of a larger diameter than the cylinder.  This ring stops the sleeve from sliding below the top of the cylinder, and also acts as a foot so you can stand the measuring cup.  Unfortunately, the ring is made from a fairly hard plastic, which can become brittle and crack.  But it doesn't break away cleanly - so you're left with a measuring cup that won't stand up straight.  That might be fine if you're measuring things and dumping them straight into a bowl, but if you have to sit the thing down while it's full, forget it",1

Potatoes and most foods used with this tool are oval shaped and do not stand up on end without slicing them.  Once you have gotten the slicer over the food, you have to press it through the slicer sections manually.  It is a better idea to get the box style cutter for about the same cost which is easier to use, has a shaped press to push the food through the blades and dishwasher safe too!

Boy was I surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as I used to have a sixx litter European and a whole chicken fits just fine. Anyway, I can't recommend this, because of the material and because of the size.

Were a zero star rating available, this product wouldn't even deserve the string of uncolored stars!I purchased it, thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic ""freebie"" grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago. After many refills, that all-plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the ""gears"", the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper.So I order this one -- it's attractive, low/mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out -- and guess what? I'm still using the plastic worn-out grinder! This MIU grinder was a total waste of money and I just can't bear to listen to it squeal when I attempt to use it. Its adjustement is loose enough, that's not the problem.   What good's a lifetime warranty against wearing out if I'm not going to use the grinder at all?Now I'm stuck with it, unless I want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order, so basically, I may could get a few bucks back. Which is probably what I'll do because this grinder isn't worth 2 cents! I wouldn't even give the thing away.Maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person.

Turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out.  Perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work; unfortunately I can't figure out what that adjustment would be.  Based on other reviews, I'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue.

So before you buy into the hype and purchase an item you'll eventually discard (if you love your dog, that is) you should know that dogs hate this device. It feels totally unnatural to them. Its so-called ""scientific"" design is based on the way a supposed alpha wolf enforces his authority by aggressively gripping a subordinate around the muzzle with his teeth. (Nice, huh?) Since we now know that the alpha theory is false, the rationale behind this torture device for dogs is equally bogus. (Wild wolf packs do not form dominance hierarchies or spend time trying to show each other who's boss by grabbing each other around the snout; such behaviors are only produced when wolves are forced to form unnatural packs while living in captivity.) A device that mimics a totally unnatural act of aggression cannot be considered positive.As a dog trainer, and just as a human being who loves dogs and hates to see them being mistreated, I cannot stress strongly enough that this device should not be used on any dog, ever.So what do you do to keep your dog from pulling? Dogs don't really pull on the leash so much as they get pulled on by things in the environment that stimulate and attract their instincts.

Unfortunately, this model doesn't work that way...at least, not the one I received.I started with a partial roll, and it was obvious this wouldn't work, so I put in an extra-large roll of top quality (very thick roll) paper towels, and still, they don't come close to reaching the spring-loaded arm.This arm is no more effective at preventing a number of sheets from pulling off the roll than the old wooden one I had with no arm at all.  I'm very disappointed.  Before deciding on this model, I had viewed some very similar models that were higher in price...maybe this is a case of ""you get what you pay for"".If you are looking for a paper towel holder that looks nice, and are not concerned about ""function""...it may be worth the price.  If you are looking for one that looks nice AND can offer you an easy one-sheet-at-a-time-with-one-hand quick pull, I suggest you look for a different model.  This unit won't do that job",1
621,"I really wanted to love this!. I bought this at a store, and thought it was such a great deal. And it was, until I lit the candles. The candles are made of such crappy wax, that they dissolved within the first hour or so of burning. I gave one to my coworker, and it melted down and burned a hole in his desk.

When I took it out of the bag at home, I noticed a chip on the edge and a crack starting to run the length of the side. (The item was not broken when I purchased it. It must've broken when my daughter dropped it on the driveway.)  The plastic is hard, not flexible. Very disappointed in this KitchenAid product",1

624,"Too Small. I have no idea where they came up with 3 cups on this because it will only take about 8 oz. of water. They must mean demi-tasse cups.

We did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread, setting a timer for 1 minute, pressing cancel, reversing the bread, and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again.

After just opening these they seem ""disposable"" and thin. They are also very noisy each and every time you touch them. Forget about moving your head about on these. IF they do in fact help people with allergies then they are a great product, but I was really looking for some nice soft, washable pillow covers and these are not it. They remind me of the blue disposable shoe covers that doctors wear before going into surgery. Also, they do not look like the picture shown, they are darker (almost yellow) and striped.",1
642,"Nice Look, Horrible Performance. I was originally looking for the Bosch Turbo Jet vac but found out that Bosch is no longer making the Turbo Jet under their name but they are now making the Turbo Jet for Vax. I purchased mine at Best Buy. I really like the looks and the features however this vacuum does an extremely horrible job on carpets. The brush roll assembly unit automatically adjusts to the height of the carpet however this is one if the major flaws I noticed that hurts it. When you push forward on the vacuum, the brush assembly tilts up toward the air preventing the brush rollers from making contact with the carpet. There is no way you can manually adjust the height of the rollers so it will make contact with the carpet. You also cannot tell the carpet is vacuumed after numerous runs over the same area due to the tilt angle of the rollers. The emissions is also bad. The vacuum does not emit a ""fresh"" air smell but instead emits the smell of plastic and carpet. The filter does a horrilble job emitting clean air. The last item that I think hurts this model is the hose unit. It is an akward design that is hard to use because the hose length is short and hard to pull which makes the vacuum fall forward at times. I returned the vacuum to a different Best Buy than the one I originally purchased at. The rep at the returns counter informed me that they have only been carrying Vax's for only a few months but they have had an extremely high return rate on Vax compared to their other brands. I walked over to the vacuum section after I was done with the return to replace it with the Eureka 4870 which is one of Consumer Report's top three vacs and beats the heck out of Dyson's. There must of been at least 7 used Vax's on the floor being sold as returns. The Eureka is amazing and blows away the Vax at one hundred dollars less.",1
643,"Great Machine- ** NO Support ** Its the service after the sale that counts. I confess, I like Starbucks. I like to have my cappuccino made for me. I also like to make my own on occaision.This machine worked well for a while and then it seemed to be clogged after a couple of months of not being used. There were two available options for service. One company in my whole state who was 2 hours away and the manufacturers rep in NY. I chose NY. I didn't get it out until after the year was up, although I had gotten a number at 10-11 months.They charged me $70 to fix the machine, claiming that --I-- did something to one of the hoses.Gaggia Esspresso is a great machine, but don't expect service if something goes wrong. I laid out over $200 for the machine which I rarely used. Then another $70-$80 bucks to get it fixed when it should have been covered by warranty.Next time I'll buy another brand. I won't reccommend any other one, because I don't want you to think I work for a different brand. I don't",1
644,"Small and fragile. I bought this item brand new and in hot pink colored (caught my eye). Flashy, small & cool looking! However, it contains 1 LED light which is bright but not wide spread. So when reading it lights up only the center of the page. You will have to constantly reposition it to keep from straining your eyes.  The constant bending and reposition will affect the fragile wiring on this thing.  About 10-15 uses after buying this product, I noticed a flikering (very annoying).  It slowly worsens the more I used it. In fact, I put the thing away and haven't used it again b/c of the annoyance. Thank goodness I didn't pay much for it. Value for the money is about a ""7"" because you get what you pay for.  Spend the money and try something else with more than 1 LED in it.

645,"Not Scientific, and Not Positive. The Gentle Leader is advertised as a scientifically designed, positive training device. It's neither. So before you buy into the hype and purchase an item you'll eventually discard (if you love your dog, that is) you should know that dogs hate this device. It feels totally unnatural to them. Its so-called ""scientific"" design is based on the way a supposed alpha wolf enforces his authority by aggressively gripping a subordinate around the muzzle with his teeth. (Nice, huh?) Since we now know that the alpha theory is false, the rationale behind this torture device for dogs is equally bogus. (Wild wolf packs do not form dominance hierarchies or spend time trying to show each other who's boss by grabbing each other around the snout; such behaviors are only produced when wolves are forced to form unnatural packs while living in captivity.) A device that mimics a totally unnatural act of aggression cannot be considered positive.As a dog trainer, and just as a human being who loves dogs and hates to see them being mistreated, I cannot stress strongly enough that this device should not be used on any dog, ever.So what do you do to keep your dog from pulling? Dogs don't really pull on the leash so much as they get pulled on by things in the environment that stimulate and attract their instincts. So the trick to training a dog NOT to pull is to play games that will make YOU more interesting and more appealing to his instincts than the things in the environment are.",1

I'd be paying for the mug threefold if I did and probably would find missing glaze on the replacement. I wasted my money. The store that sells this mug via Amazon didn't check the merchandise prior to sending it.The box it arrived in was in a larger box with packing foam.

649,"Oxo finally messes up. I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4"" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8"" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door",1

The top beans are coarsely grinded and the bottom beans are Turkey-Coffee-Fine grinded. No matter how hard you shake during the grinding process, it doesn't help. Coffee still comes out that way. 2]. You cannot grind many at a time. Putting too many beans in the grinder will only worsen the outcome. 3]. As previous posters said, it is very difficult and messy to 'pour' out the coffee (if you can call it pour). I use brush, spoon, folks, chopsticks, and everything in between to take the coffee out. But there is ALWAYS something left behind. 4]. The machine cannot take grinning time continuously anything longer than 20 minutes. If you work it this hard, it simply stops work. You have to wait for 10 minutes to have it work again.Rethink about buying this grinder",1

669,"Bought it, tried it, returned it. One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the ""flip it"" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the ""dirty water"" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.

678,Poor design. I assumed because this is Cuisinart that this would be a great product and worth the $50.00. It has turned out to be a total waste of money.The design is poor because there are no vent holes in the top of the popper so it fills with condensation which in turn makes the popcorn soggy. Im pretty ingenious so I thought that if I drilled a few holes myself in the top this would take care of the problem. It did not help at all. I tried several types of kernels to see if that would help the situation and it did not. I use coconut oil always and did not change that. I think because the surface area of the popper is much smaller then other poppers that contributes to the problem. I never had a problem with the traditional dome top poppers and im going back to that style.,1

680,Are u a deep sleeper?. O.k. I bought this type of product in the past but it was a COTTON material - it works perfect.  I tried to save a few bucks and ordered this cheaper version and the first night I had it on it sounds like your sleeping on trash bags or newspapers like my girlfriend says.The product works as intended.  Quality is good. Zipper is strong. But I just hope your a sound DEEP sleeper or you'll be awaken everytime you move your head.  Just pay nearly double more for the COTTON version - I wish I had this time around!!,1
681,"Against a wall. This piece definitely isn't what I had hoped for.  However, it was easy to put together, and it is sturdy.  You pretty much have to have this piece up against a wall, as there is no back piece on the main frame to hide the back of the drawer.  &#60;br /&#62;The allen wrench it came with for assembly became 'rounded out' before I could finish with all the hex screws.

Why would they produce an item that is so ugly, especially when their ad shows a lovely color combination?  Do not order from these sellers without clarifying exactly what you will receive",1

704,Item is Not as Described!. I ordered two of these pans.  One for myself and one for my sister.  We DID NOT RECEIVE A STAINLESS PAN! We received an aluminum pan with a non-stick black coating on the interior.  The pans we received were from the MC2 collection.  Amazon sent me a new pan but I received another MC2 pan.  So now I have to return two pans and my sister must return one.  We are both collecting the 3-ply All-Clad stainless cookware.  I am very dissapointed.  Amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan,1
705,Do a test run. I bought this machine and a Dyson the same day. This one I bought for our lower level family room. After assembly I found it was very hard to operate and heavy!I now see why they store models are put so high up out of the consumers reach. The upolstry tool is worthless. I find the dust and debis collects around the filter until the machine will absolutely clog up and stop. the Dyson? Worth every penny and I should have bought 2.,1
706,Find another blanket. I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.,1
707,"very poor quality. I have used Wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness.  But I sincerely regret having bought these sheets.  I purchased one set, and, after the 2nd wash, there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little ""balls"" felt scratchy).  My husband asked me why we were using the ""old"" sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn!  I was so suprised that I called Wamsutta directly, and the very nice lady there assured me that I must have gotten a defective set, because that simply ""doesn't happen with their sheets"".  So I exchanged them with an identical pair.  And the end of the story is that I am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing.  What a disappointment.  Absolutely do not recommend, and am now very wary of all Wamsutta products",1
708,"Not as good as I expected. We bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name. We have been using it for about 4 months now. It cooks good rice. However, the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said. We've got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason. And the rice was in ""keep warm"" mode at all times. In addition, if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the ""keep warm"" mode for a day, the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy. So, you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout. I haven't tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice. If I were to decide all over again, I would stay away from this rice cooker. I thought I've bought a top-notched product, now I regret that I spent this much on a rice cooker",1
709,"Very Disappointed. I was all excited that I could put any solution i want in it and that it had a scrubber, but when i got it.  It was so hard to put together.  Then the cleaner i put in started to leak. Then the handle part kept on coming apart.  Then it didn't look right.  The mop pads are a joke, they don't just come off when you turn the knob which i can't even do that.  It does not take any mop pads because the swiffer wet jet mop pads are my fave and I had to put velro on the bottom so that they would work on it. And most of all the thing is so heavy.  You have to have some upper body streanth just to move it. The scrubber head is no were near how big it look on Tv.  It was a very big dissapointment not to mention it was my Xmas present to my self.  Black and Decker should stick to power tools and leave the mops up to swiffer.  I love my Swiffer wet Jet.  Best Mop I have ever used.  Wish they would make it so i could use any cleaning solution that i wanted though",1
710,"Dangerous Product. I've had two Hamilton Beach products. The first was Brew Master, which we wanted because the coffee is dispensed through a coffee carafe at the top of the machine. However, the carafe is plastic with seams and after 4 months began to leak all over the counter. Hamilton Beach replaced the carafe, but the new one leaked again after 4 months. We then demanded a Stay or Go Thermal Coffeemaker. I had it for two or three weeks and then as I was washing it out with hot water and a bottle sponge, the glass vacuum liner blew up with a bang! Glass shards scattered all over the sink and kitchen floor. I was lucky not to have gotten shards in my eyes. Please look out for this one! I'm only buying stainless steel carafes from now on",1

712,"Are these defective products?. I have a few pieces of the Wilton Armetale Reggae line, which I purchased from a department store and which I enjoy.  So I purchased two of these petite trays from Amazon, and they arrived looking like defective products, both of them.  I expected the petite trays to have a smooth, bright shiny surface (like my others).  Rather, both trays are dull gray and the surface is the texture of an orange peel!  In addition, the carved design around the edges should be filled with black ink (or whatever that is), but portions of the carvings are not even colored.  In short, I was shocked and disappointed in the quality of this product.  I wonder if Amazon is selling defective goods that didn't pass the muster for a department store.",1
713,"It's Junk. I had this toaster for under 3 years when I came home one day and it smoked and died. I have to agree that it didn't toast evenly but at least it looked cool and worked. Now, Kitchen Aid wants me to pay $52 for a pro-rated replacement (which is supposed to be Half Price)and I can buy it here for $63.  I always thought people paid more for Kitchen Aid because of the reliability factor. A one year warranty on a $100 TOASTER makes no sense. I wanted something better than the $9.99 drugstore models and got a mediocre (though cool looking) toaster that lasted less than 3 years. I am VERY dissatisfied and will not buy another Kitchen Aid product.",1
714,"Too small for a betta. Caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper.In a small bowl like this, the fish's waste will build up rapidly (espcially since there is no filter). This causes suffering (for example, eye and skin irritation), sickness, and even death. You can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently; however, frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish. (Not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper!)In addition, the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly; another source of stress for the fish. You cannot use a heater in a bowl this small.Bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to 80F; there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons.If you'd like to care for a fish, please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can. (Ignore manufacturers websites, since of course they will say their products are great, even crummy products like this one.) Get the largest tank you can afford. If you can't afford a large enough tank, please don't get the fish.",1
715,Overpriced Garbage!. I find it more than a bit ridiculous that Pur charges 40 dollars for their product and 20 - 25 dollars for their replacement filters.  I have owned 3 Pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use.  Why?  Because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time.  Tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse.  Removing and reinstalling the unit does not help.  I have become so frustrated by Pur water products that I will never again purchase anything made by them.  I just installed a Brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the Brita is more reasonably priced at up to 15 dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this over-priced piece of junk at all costs,1
716,Rice sticks. The pan doesn't have a non-stick coating so the rice sticks (go figure). Not a bad brand from what I hear - I just prefer a cooker with a non stick coating,1

720,"Look elsewhere if you plan to make fries. I found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill:1.) Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids.  Getting them out is a real pain, you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them.  Just a mess.2.) If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone.  Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction.3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself.  I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously.  Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating.I guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes.  For me, I've decided to get one of those Vollcraft units.  It's on order",1
721,"Don't bother!. Don't waste your time.  I bought these for a birthday gift for my mother because they matched her bathroom perfectly.  Believe it or not, her bday was december 12th.  They still haven't even been shipped.  Don't waste your time it's not worth it",1

723,Filtration System Problem. The power filtration system (motor) burns out in about 1 year.  Eclipse does not sell the system as a separate accessory so you can't replace the item without buying a whole new aquarium system,1

However, as other reviewers noted, almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day. I wasn't intending to use the delay feature very often so I didn't bother to return it. Now, just short of a year after I received it, it suddenly started working, so I'm shopping for a replacement. I might try another Mr. Coffee model with better reviews, but not this one",1
725,Not for hardwood floors!. I bought this vacuum and it was fine on carpet (though a bit noisy.)  It was awful on hardwood floors - it blew the dust everywhere.  Stay away if you plan on using it on anything besides carpet,1
726,Split in 6 weeks. This cutting board developed a split only 6 weeks after I got it.  It has had proper care and minimal use.  Don't buy it.  Shipping was timely - no problem there,1
727,Not worth even a penny - TORTILLA REMAINS UNCOOKED IN THE INSIDE. I read the review for this product on Amazon. Lindsey who is one of the 2 reviewers of this product actually had posted a video of the product usage and I was very much convinced by that. I thought the product is good and ordered it immediately. The product arrived in 4-5 days and was in good condition.The most important problem with the roti maker is1. the roti/tortilla is not cooked properly. It remains very much uncooked. Even though you see it puff and everything from the inside it remains uncooked which actually causes a lot of acidity problems.2. Also such an uncooked tortilla when left for a few minutes becomes very dry and difficult to eat. You have to eat the tortilla immediately within 10-15 minutes of the making.Just imagine if you are making 5-7 tortillas the first one will be come dry and difficult to chew.3. The product works as described but the tortillas are not at all good for health since they remain uncooked in the inside,1
728,"You get what you pay for!. I bought this item because it seemed to be the right size for my family and the price was right.  As I've been using it, I'm finding that even though it comes with a dough blade, it doesn't knead bread dough well at all.  The dough builds up under the blade and pops the blade up, stopping the kneading action and allowing the motor to run at a very right rate.  This overheats the motor within a matter of seconds.Second, with the chopping blade I've found that unless the items being chopped are of a dry nature, the machine simply pastes the food together and whirls the unchopped food around in a circle above the blade (dried fruit, for example).  The food has no chance to reach the blade at all.Finally, the 10 cup capacity is a deceptive label.  The actual liquid maximum level is about 4 cups, but if you put  more in the processor after the liquid (as in flour or other ingredients), the liquid will come out onto the counter through the center hole.  The blades do not seal the center opening, so to say that this machine holds 10 cups is quite misleading.  When making salsa, I can only make small batches at a time or the salsa spills over through the inside of the workings and ends up on the counter and plugging up the blades.Be advised, there is one speed and one speed only.  The pulse feature is not a true pulse, but just a quick on and then off of the one speed.  It takes several seconds for the pulse to wind down, just the same as it takes the main speed to stop.I will continue to use this machine until it breaks because I already paid for it, but I will not buy another one.  I expect that the leakage through the center of the bowl will cause enough internal damage that I'll be in the market for another processor in a short amount of time.",1
729,"Supplemental Use Only. I use this vacuum to supplement my Dyson as I have 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 children.  It works well on wood floors and even my basement floors where I  keep my cats' litter boxes. However, the cord is short and it does not work very well on carpet. Sometimes I'll vacuum closet spaces or use it on our stairs; however, I would not recommend using this as your main source for sweeping up after your pets.  My Dyson is a miracle worker compared to this, and the customer service department for Dyson is much more efficient. When one of my children broke my Dyson hose, I called the customer service department and they sent me another hose at no charge.  The Shark filter costs nearly $18 to replace, and because the Shark is a small vacuum, it does not take long before the filter needs to be replaced if you have pets who shed a lot.  I have even rinsed the filter, but it still bears replacing.   It's great for sweeping up small jobs, but if you are looking for something to suction up a large space or after pets and children, keep looking",1
730,"Innova Dutch Oven. Have purchased the 5 QT version of this Dutch Oven. During the second use of it, the bottom layer developed a bubble, separated from there, making this utensil totally useless. I am now trying out the warranty and see if there really is an exchange for it",1

If it is too small (fruity pebbles) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere! I definetly would not buy this product again. At one point I even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away. The time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter",1

The paperback one does not provide much light at all, though the page is readable. Just not what I was expecting. But the worst part is the annoying and very distinct wavy pattern on the pages -- it's like an overlay of a printed pattern that covers the entire page.

My husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus, no more pinched fingers.  I would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around.

At least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out, but I'm afraid of the morning when I try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck. (We leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in. When she gets a little older, we will leave her in her crate all day.) We could still use the zippers on the top, but we don't like those since the dog can't get in and out at her leisure.Although in general it's a nice crate, I probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers--hence the two stars.

806,"Stoped working after 1.5 years. Wished it lasted longer. My wife got this Cuisinart Classic Toaster oven as a wedding gift. We liked the appearance and had it on our registry. We used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well. Toast was perfect, and the oven cooked nice and hot. We broiled meats and made all kind of things in it. We found it hard to clean. We would take the baking pan/and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those, but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven.Then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter. I glued it back on with super glue. It broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so I had to fix this plastic foot a few times.Then another problem arose. The toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start. So to make toast we just used the un-timed bake function, but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast. Still we lived with it.Then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working. So it does not bake. I think I knew this was going to happen because I would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever I turned the dial to bake for a while.So therefore I think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last. I would have expected better quality. Considering how long we have been making toaster ovens, I think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls.So like other reviews say, it does cook well and evenly, but it is hard to clean and does not last. If I were to have rated the product before the problems started I would have given it 4 stars. I wish that Amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality, because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products.We are now looking into T-Fall Convection Toaster oven, but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts.______________Since writing my review above I tried to fix my oven to no avail, but I have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke.My recommendations are as follows. Since I know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this ""Classic"" model product can over time get dirty and stop working, I recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops, rice cookers, deep fryers, pressure cookers, or kitchen sinks. Especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease.I recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls, which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location. This might make the unit last longer.The newer Cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem I had. Or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways. Maybe 1.5 years is average life, or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction. Reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products. From the reviews and my observations above, I think the Krups models and the improved Cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me.",1

I used it about 2 weeks ago and it still has water in it. I called Conair customer service and they told me you have to use all the water by steaming it out. There is a small plastic cap device and that's the only means of putting water in or taking it out. It's the same type of cap used on pool flotation devices. I'm returning this because of the water reservoir problem. It needs to be redesigned.

The whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring.  Even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat, the water would still jump from the spout.

It was only after persistent calling that they finally shipped the percolator to us and it arrived in worse condition.  It took them four months to return the percolator to us.  They refused to replace the percolator because we owned it for more than 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful and understanding and assisted us with a refund.We unfortunately own two of these percolators and when the lid broke on the second one, I had to contact Electra Craft, again.  They were able to provide the part, a simple stainless steel lid, for $25.00 plus shipping and handling!  I'm sure their other replacement parts are overpriced as well",1

They both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch. The 1.9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button.  Also it is the worst stainless steel I have ever seen. It stains instantly and for ever. I had another Zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic.

The good news is that the red border color that I chose did not bleed in the washer.  Further, they did not shrink at all.

It has no clock, no timer, no automatic turnoff (It will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off.

The spices don't stay put on the carousel either, they constantly fall off. I know you are suppose to be able to attach them under the counter, perhaps that would be better.

843,"Completely Wrong Material. As a serious amateur woodworker who has also studied the design and building of wooden boats, let me say that beechwood is by far one of the inferior materials one could choose for making wooden spoons.  Olivewood is by far the superior material for this sort of common yet critical kitchen tool. Should you doubt this, please visit the kitchens of France, Italy and Spain to see what's stirring the pot.Additionally, fabricating the spoon by gluing multiple pieces together is a lesson in engineering failure. It violates the most basic principles of woodworking.  Wood, because it is made by nature and not man is not uniform.  Wood not only expands and contracts as it heats and cools, but also as it draws up moisture and dries.  Multiple pieces equals multiple rates of expanding and contracting, working against the glued joint.While Oxo makes and sells some very fine kitchen tools (I have a vegetable peeler by them that's the best I've ever owned and it's about a decade old), this is sure not among them.A product to avoid",1
844,"Don't get this one. I've had an old coffee maker for a long time that makes good coffee but I thought I was ready for something even better.  I am disappointed with this one.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with a KitchenAid product, but sure enough, I did.  The design is attractive and I like that you don't have to purchase paper filters.  However, I have two problems with it: 1) The coffee isn't hot enough. I like a very hot cup of coffee because I put milk in it which cools it down a little.  My old coffee maker made very hot coffee so it didn't matter how much milk I put in, it was still hot.  Not so with this one.  The coffee was luke warm after I put my usual amount of milk in.  This is my main complaint and I'll probably have to return it for this reason.  2) Next problem is that I set the automatic timer so I could wake up to a fresh brewed cup of coffee.  I set it according to the manual instructions and I think I did it correctly.  When I woke up this morning, no coffee!!  What a disappointment.

After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one whose had these problems. I didn't pay for the thing, but if you're planning on it, my suggestion is DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM.

I love every other item I've tried that carries the OXO name, but this one is a miserable failure. My main complaint is that when you line the screw up with the cork, and the wings are down, there's nowhere to grab for stability when turning the knob on the top. You have to kind of poke your fingers between where the wings meet and squeeze. Once you do get it going, half the time it only goes part of the way in and you end up with a half-removed, or worse - broken - cork.Terrible terrible terrible.

Better than my Electrolux...The bad:The hose and extension wands are proprietory, that is, don't expect to use your old crevise and brush attachments with all of that superior suction.  You can't attach the crevice tool at the end of one of the wands.  You need to attach the crevice tool to order to put on the brush.    Gimicky.Furthermore, the wands FLY apart unless you JAM them in HARD.The unit lacks a beater-bar.  DON'T expect this to be of ANY value on carpeting.The on/off switch is small and could be positioned better.  No turning this guy on/off with your foot.The bagless design is old-school.  It uses the same permanent coffee filter design that's been around for years and years, and you can see it clog up in no time.  The superior suction does compensate for that, but you'd think that after Dyson had solved the problem one way, others would be soon to follow.  Not the case here.But the real bug is that the RELEASE of the dirt compartment is part of THE HANDLE.  Be REAL careful picking this guy up or the dirt will go flying all over (and down the stairs!).  Who would think someone would pick the thing up by the handle?HOWEVER, I should say that the suction IS very good and if you don't need carpet cleaning, will never want to use your own cleaning attachments and use it under limited circumstances, it's not a bad deal for the price.

You really can't drink coffee from the mugs which come with this coffeemaker, unless the lids are off the mug... a definite design defect which defeats the purpose of a travel mug.  It is a very simple oversight: there is no &quot;vent&quot; hole in the mug's lid, so that coffee barely dribbles out of the sipping hole, even when the mug is full, and even if you tilt the mug as high as if you were drinking the last drops from the bottom of the mug.  It is a very frustrating experience.  Please also consider that the two cups may not fill up evenly as the coffee brews; one may slightly overflow while the other mug is not full.  Then there is the instruction book.  The English is fine, but does it really make sense to instruct the user to heat up the mugs first with hot water, and then to instruct the user to measure cold water into the same mug to fill the reservoir?  Of course, the user can figure his way around that, but the only way to use these mugs would be to drill an extra pinhole in each mug's lid for venting, or just use the mug around the house, without the lid.  The mug is comfortable to hold, but the thermal value is not too good, even when preheated with boiling water. I regret having made this purchase",1

Was happy with this toaster until I had it for about 4 months.At that time the lever started acting up by not staying down.Sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down. Not what I expect from a $70 toaster. Well, I have finally given up (2 months later) and am sending it back to Hamilton Beach since too much time has passed to send it to Amazon. They are sending me a new one, which I am not sure I am happy about. Might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven.........",1

The stupid pieces don't fit together right and so if you move it,  you have to pick it up from the base or it falls apart.   AND the switch gets stuck pretty much all the time so that it's really hard to turn it.  I'm the kind of person who enjoys fixing things so I've taken it apart and tried to fix it and its still rotten.  The second lamp is just completely broken now after only 6 weeks.

As everyone else mentions, the drawers get stuck and do not glide and then when you try to pull them out, the cheap knobs fall off.  On top of this we try to call the manufacturer listed on the brochure (techniwood) and the phone rings and rings and then disconnects you.  This product is a joke and it is appalling that Target would sell this after all the bad reviews.  We are too busy to waste hours putting something together that doesn't even work.  We're so mad that I don't think we will ever shop at Target again!!! &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If Target really cares about good customer service and customer relations -- they would get rid of this product and manufacturer before they further tarnish their brand image.

897,"Hmmmm... This is cute and kitschy, but too small and overpriced. They aren't kidding around putting *mini* in the name of this item. It's way too big to make individual servings of cake with, and yet not nearly large enough to use up anywhere near one full sized cake's batter. You would need at least four or five of these to use up the typical cake's batter. For that price, you can buy a full sized bear cake pan and have money left over",1
898,"Broke in a few weeks. I wanted this to work, since I have a house full of unglazed, porous, beige ceramic tile floors with white grout (no, it wasn't my idea). It would be a full-time job just trying to stay ahead of the ground-in dirt that rapidly shows up. And the Scooba did work, at least on the superficial dirt, the first time I used it. Unfortunately, it failed on two counts: it couldn't get out the ground-in dirt; and it broke within a few weeks. To be fair, not much else--short of getting down on my hands and knees and attacking the floor with a scrub brush--gets up the dirt either. But the clincher is that after only a few uses, the Scooba's cover stuck closed and couldn't be reopened without a big struggle. Then getting it reclosed again proved almost impossible. Add this fight to the normal hassle of dealing with all the fiddly little parts in the device, and it just became unusable. Oh, and when it did work, it tended to leak spots of dirty water and leave occasional black ""skid marks"" on the floor",1

They say it will be the end of April before I will receive it. I should cancel, but I'm in no hurry.

Unlike many people it seems, I've never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker -- it's still sturdy for me after about 8 uses.However, the fact that I've owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself. This waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles. I've NEVER  been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles I've had in restaurants.After trying over half a dozen different recipes, I realized that it wasn't my ingredients -- it was the waffle maker. This waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be -- crispy on the outside, chewy and moist on the outside.Instead, no matter what recipe I used, or how long I cooked the waffles for, I would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness (if they had any to begin with!) within moments of leaving the waffle maker.The model doesn't burn the waffles, the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking, and overall the waffle maker is nice looking. But that's all it has going for it. I've learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances, you get what you pay for.",1
901,"Terrible performance. I have this filter only for about 3 months and it is already leaking on the seams. I crazy glued it and it works while I'm waiting for a new system from Aquafana.

I bought this toaster to replace my cheap $10 Toastmaster, which held up for more than 10 years [it was still working when I tossed it in favor of this name-brand toaster].  The sliding shelf that holds the bread in place is made of a very thin, soft and flimsy steel.  After only 2 years of use, the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism; and it could not be fixed.  The shelf is hooked onto the slider by 2 small prongs that ultimately broke off.  I am surprised that KitchenAid would sell a piece of junk like this",1

It is fine for keeping warm during the night but I want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does.  It is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well.  Not worth the money at all,1

907,"Poorly and cheaply manufactured...possibly a fire hazzard. I received this unit the first week of November 2006.  By Valentines day it was toast (no pun intended).At first it worked fine.  I used it to warm the end of our big living room near the front door where it is was almost always cold.  I set the thermostat at about 3/4 maximum and left it to work. It was also completely quiet as advertised.Then, sometime in January, I noticed that the On/Off knob was turning brown near the edges--as if discolored by excessive heat.  I turned it off to investigate.  Then turned it on again.  Nothing. The unit was dead.  After repeatedly turning it off and on I noticed sparking underneath the switch.  After repeatedly spinning the switch between off/on it would finally come back on and would stay on for 2 or 3 days until it failed again.After about 10 days of this I unplugged it out of fear for my family's safety. Now it waits in my garage until I can take a trip to the dump and dispose of it.  WHAT A GIANT HASSLE FOR A 55 DOLLAR HEATER! And don't doubt for a second that Honeywell COUNTS on people not wanting to hassle with returns.Another example of an electronic device made as cheaply as possible with little or no regard for quality or safety.It will be a cold day in you-know-what before I purchase anything else from Honeywell.

A few weeks ago, I received the DeLonghi EC701 Espresso Maker in the mail.  After 3 (yes only 3) uses, the lever that controls the steam knob broke off.  Just ripped right off.

I got in touch with the VP I had been dealing with (once I found his number), and he is much more responsive -- promised to send me a new ""factory tested model"" today.But, can all the problems I've had with all the DeLonghi espresso makers be just a coincidence?  I don't think so.  The quality just isn't there.  Buy from another manufacturer if you want one that will last.

929,"Expensive Mistake!. The Venta-Airwasher may be good as a humidifier in countries like Germany where it is extremely cold in winter and the heating stays on 24 hours round the clock, thus there is a continuous need to replace the replenished humidity in the air. But here in San Francisco the weather is mild and we have plenty of humidity in the air due to fog and there is no need to keep heating on 24 hours. If one airs one's apartment on a regular basis, one would have sufficient humidity in doors. What we need here is a good solid air-purifier to clean the allergens, dust, etc from the air.The problem with the Airwasher is that it has no separate button to turn off the humidifier section when the room gets saturated with humidity. Secondly, there is no thermostat built in to check and turn off the machine when the humidity reaches the optimum level in the room. Because both humidifier and air cleaner are one, you can't separate the two. Thus if you keep on running the machine after saturation point, you'll get mold all over the walls and clothes. Even my clothes in my wardrobe were wet. I had to stop using the machine. For the past two weeks I could hardly find clothes to wear that were dry. Thirdly, what they don't tell you on their web site and publicity brochures is that this machine requires an expensive chemical substance added to the water chamber on a regular basis otherwise it won't clean the air. But even then, this machine is more of a humidifier than an air cleaner. After two weeks of use I noticed almost no residue in the water chamber, i.e. it did not clean the air at all. I felt the change that air was getting cleaner once I operated the new Sharper Image Hybrid GP Germicidal Air Purifier. I am glad that I bought two different machines to try. Now I know.By the way, the Venta-Airwasher has not been tested by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM)or the US Environmental Protection Agency or the http://www.cadr.org/ for Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). When I called the company in Illinois and asked why, I was told that their technology is different than the competition that's why. Well, if you believe in that excuse go and buy this machine and see it for yourself. The machine is made of plastic and is very basic.",1

I originally went to the store to buy another Vornado heater that received good reviews on Amazon, however the store only had the DVH in stock and it was on sale, so I went with the DVH, I was excited about bringing it home to heat the living room when I watched TV and my bedroom at night.  Well I tested the unit last night in my bedroom ( about 150-200sqft) and it was very disapointing.  I live in CA and the temp in my house is around 60 degrees between Dec-Feb, I wanted a heater to heat up my bedroom at night so I could sleep comfortably and I place it in  in the bathroom in the morning so I can get out of the shower and not freeze to death.  This unit's performance was horrible!  I set the DVH on High and set the temp to 72 degrees before I went to sleep, throughout the night  the room still felt cold, in the morning I looked at the DVH and it states that the room temp was around 63 degrees!  The heater hardly changed the temp of the room the whole night!  I then  adjusted the temp to 90 degrees and placed the unit in the bathroom, by the end of my shower the room temp was only registering 65 degrees!! I left it on for another hour to test and when I came back the room temp hardly changed, maybe only by a few degrees!!...the heat coming from the DVH was not that hot and the fan did not seem that strong.  Needless to say I am returning this heater today!  It seems that the quality control at Vornado is not consistent on this heater, some people rave about this heater, yet many others have similar negative experiences like mine.  I would recommend staying away from this heater and spend your hard earned money on something better!  Hope this review helps",1

942,"NOT dishwasher safe. A drawback of Calphalon's anodized alumninum is that it cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher.  But stainless steel is dishwasher safe, and Amazon's product description claims that Calphalon's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe.  But if you check out www.calphalon.com and look at the description of their stainless line, it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent.  So it is ""dishwasher safe"" but you can't use dishwasher detergent.",1
943,"Never got it. I ordered this item and was told it would take several weeks for delivery, then I received an e-mail a few weeks later that it was going to take even longer....so I cancelled the order.   I'm sure it would have been a good machine, but I went with the larger 7-cup model and I'm happy I did.",1
944,"not all of us are chimps...this is a lousy coffee maker. I have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping....while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee, if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it, it will overflow....very frustrating as we like strong coffee. Because ours has overflowed so many times, the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it won't hold water....I'll never buy this frogware again",1
945,"Stay Away!. I had researched this product for juicing ability and power.  I ended up buying this one and after using it *twice* the motor just shut off.  I returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement.  I decided to try juicing carrots and celery, and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again.  I might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it.  If you are juicing small things, like berries, with larger vegetables/fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade.  I know I read these bad reviews and said, &quot;oh that won't happen to me&quot;... but it did.  I hope you choose a different juicer",1

947,"Very disappointing. After reading the enthusiastic reviews by other customers, I decided to buy this one.  Too bad.Who picked out these colors...they are so dull!  The white is boring, the greenish-gray and black(supposed to be blue)is dreary like a rainy day.  They smell like industrial laundry detergent.  Even the plate is not useable since it looks like it has drips of old candle wax on it",1
948,"Not a Good experience - No stars. I do not even rate this one star, but the website does not go any lower.We used this product only once before we had to throw it in the garbage can.  It was not very sturdy and bent after normal use.   Would not buy another one",1
949,"Not very waterproof. I know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer, but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside. I took out the battery and found water in the compartment.I give it as many as two stars because until the water got in, it did work as advertised. And seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing, I'm wondering if I just had a bad o-ring.Now, I'm off to find a better thermometer",1
950,"Disappointing. I looked forward to this combo slicer/press, but it is difficult to use, and if you put more than one clove of garlic in, you have to manipulate the ""press"" part to actually go into the space it is designed for.  Clean up was not easy.",1
951,"Delivery ruined bookcase. What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn.  It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane!  The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape.I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition",1
952,"Inexpensive Chinois. I returned this item. I was looking for a very fine strainer while this was actually a pierced metal strainer, making it too coarse for my needs. Otherwise the unit was of good quality. The holes are much finer than a typical collander, so it could meet someone else's needs better than mine",1
953,"Rip-off. Beware of this ironing board.  It is nothing special, kind of rickety, and the shipping charges are almost as much as the board, which I missed becuase I was ordering a lot of things at once, and I was shocked when I got the bill, but I guess it's too bulky to return easily, so I just lose, but you are warned..",1
954,"Don't use dark fountains. Petmate makes a great fountain, but their black model should be discontinued.  It is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it.  When I went to wash this fountain, like I usually do every couple of weeks, there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it.  I think the pump motor might have been leaking (I'm not really sure). If I had their white fountain I would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away",1
955,"Not a good one. I bought this board along with another brand.  This one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink.  It also warped within one month of my purchasing it.  The wood has also splintered.  Not my idea of a good cutting board.  I would not recommend it to my friends, nor would I purchase it as a gift",1
956,don't do it!!!!!. it's a little confusing to use and it's very easy to stop the wrong timer running because it doesn't automatically switch to the time going off.  But the worst is it's whisper quiet.  I bought this item for a professional bakery and the noise level is high.  If your running your home mixer and the timer goes off unless your right by it you won't here a thing.,1
957,"Waste of Time. We bought one of these for Christmas and it went back within 2 days.  After trying twice, it took me over an hour to ""clean"" my kitchen floors.  Some spots I had to go over 7 or 8 times - and even then it didn't clean all of it up.  Plus you have to go sooooo sloooowwwww.  And it is loud.  This machine loses suction at the slightest quick movement and you have to turn it off and back on again.  Also, the water it does pick up is dirty so you have to handle it with your hands to dump it out.  I have a 2 year old and infant - I don't have time for this ridiculous contraption.  Try a steam mop instead, like the Reliable Steamboy.  They're cheaper, faster (I can have my kitchen done in less than 5 minutes) and leave your floors ""white-sock"" clean and sanitized - without cleaners or chemicals",1
958,"Not entirely stainless steel interior. I was seeking an electric kettle specifically without any plastic in contact with the heated water (due to dioxins released from heated plastics) and all the kettles at my local store were entirely plastic (drinking heated plastic steeped water everyday is insane!  I can't believe these kinds of products are even sold.)  So I came to amazon, found this (supposedly) stainless steel one which seemed generally liked and not too cheap, and lo and behold inside is a plastic bolt, leading to the outside water level gauge!  What a brilliant piece of engineering!  Ruin the entire design by tacking on a useless feature (I already know a good way of finding out the water level: LOOK INSIDE.  Do I need to keep track of the water level as its boiling?  Thank you thats very informative that the water level did not change the entire time the water was boiling.  Here I'm pouring some out now, I am very curious to know whether the water level changed!  (nameless epitath)).  Now I am spending tomorrow at work lunch break TAKING THIS USELESS THING BACK and mailing it away, rather than drinking delicious invigorating tea.  Thanks Chef's Choice International",1
959,"Decent job, but lacks in quality. I'm a student in college, and when my first hamper ripped, I decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper. My roommate rarely does his laundry, so he has huge loads, but his hamper manages to carry it all. I saw the Whitney Design hamper online, which looked nearly identical to my roommate's hamper, so I bought it.When the hamper arrived, I put my clothes in it, and prepared to do laundry. The shoulder strap ripped right off. I didn't even fill up the hamper all the way, as is shown in the picture. Amazon sent me a replacement, but now I am afraid of using the shoulder strap again, and I have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires. This hamper may be able to function, but not well. And for a college student, this is definitely not sturdy enough",1

I thought it may have been the popcorn seeds so I bought some new ones and tried again.  Same thing!  What a disappointment! 20 minutes of popping to get less than 15 half popped and/or burnt pieces.  In the same timeframe I was able to take out my old $10.00 popper (Walmart special)and pop 3 large bowls, melt the butter and disperse to the 15 teengers waiting in movieroom.

I would like to point out that if you go to the Calphalon web site, this is the lid listed as fitting the 8-inch saute pan.The lid is usable, but doesn't seat well to get any sort of seal on the pan.  It's unfortunate, as its an attractive, well made lid, but for my purposes its useless so I am sending it back.I also have the 10-inch stainless steel lid, which fits the 10-inch saute pan perfectly.  I'm not sure why Calphalon didn't take more care designing this one",1

I never got an email and now as the remaining items have been delivered - if I need one then I will end up paying shipping too.

That is why it got a 2...otherwise it would have receive a 0.I DO love the look of that pitcher...but every one I have seen leaks after just a month or two...it leaks from the bottom seal and that is what makes it worthless.  I thought that I could just replace it and get a new one and it would be ok...it did the same thing....3 times in a row...good thing I only paid for it once.  I have a friend that replaced hers after the same issue and her second one did the same thing.  I gave up on this and looking for another picture.ATTN PUR Company!!!!

On the higher settings the entire thing vibrates making a sound you can hear on the floor below, even when it is placed on a carpeted floor. I am very disappointed with this humidifier, so much so that I might just throw it away and get a different one. I plan on never buying Vornado again.",1

977,"Beautiful Blanket with Unfortunate Controller Problem. We purchased the blanket because we felt it was superior in quality. Since it costs at least double what common blankets cost, it seemed likely that the company had done it right. Unfortunately, the first blanket controller started giving an E3 error within two weeks.

We exchanged the blanket hoping the replacement would function properly.After three weeks a new controller began displaying the E3 error.When we plugged the other side's controller in, it worked. We tried tocontact the manufacturer to request a new controller and to see it theyhad addressed the issue with a new design but it was impossible to reach them. Bottom line is we returned the second blanket and gave up.Seems like the blanket is high quality and the electronics in the controller are not",1

For food and feathers it seems to pick up about half.  Also, I've only had this sweeper 6 months and the battery slowly died and I always fully discharged and then charged the battery. I would suggest getting anopther sweeper that has suction and not just a revolving brush",1

As I vacuumed, the vibration of the machine caused the knob to drift to other settings. It was impossible to properly vacuum a bare floor since the knob drifted to the carpet settings. Hopefully this is a problem with this particular item and not a design flaw. The manufacturer plans to test the machine and determine if I am entitled to another vacuum cleaner.",1

I am finally throwing mine out to the garbage since I have had it for a while and the coating at the inside bottom of the kettle is coming apart and I have been boiling ""contaminated"" water since a while...I just noticed one day that there was this stuff floating on top of the water....I wonder what kind of chemicals I have been putting in my body???",1

And trust me, I did not misuse this shoe tree in any way.  It was used for only about 6 pair of regular shoes and sandals at any one time.  There's no way it could have held 18 & even lasted as long as it did.  So, looks can be deceiving.  This product may appear good online, but it does not do what it is supposed to do & is just not worth it.",1
993,"Doesn't do its job, and makes a big mess. I had high hopes for this little gadget, being a fan of grilled sandwiches. Unfortunately, one experience was all it took to convince me that this grill isn't the way to go.I tried to make two grilled ham and cheese sandwiches. Within about 30 seconds of the grilling, it was pouring cheese out all sides of the grill (and no, before you wonder I didn't use a lot of cheese). I didn't even let it finish the cooking cycle because the cheese was getting underneath the grill and I didn't want it near the cord.When I opened the unit I got two sandwiches that needed to be separated from one another (and cut into halves) using a steak knife, and even that was a pain. The sandwiches themselves, which started as standard store-bought bread, were now mashed into what looked more like pita bread (hollow, thin, and a little tough). The edges were burned black; just generally not a good sandwich.As opposed to cleaning the liquid cheese off, this device just went in the trash. I can't recommend this even over just a standard non-stick griddle",1
994,"Good for making a mushy mess. I have a mini-cuisinart and a full sized one, but since I received this herb processor as a gift, I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, after a day of trying to chop herbs and mince garlic with it, I'd rather spend the extra time setting up and cleaning the mini-cuisinart. I found that most of the time, this herb processor just mashes everything up, or crushes it, no matter what blade I use. Juices from the herbs or garlic just leak out, weakening their overall flavor and limiting their usefulness. If I need to quickly chop some herbs, I'd rather just do it by hand or by cuisinart",1

Well, the recharging base is not ""smart"" so you have to drain out the # of uses before putting it back on the base. The battery has memory so if by accident you put it back on the base, the life span of the battery is shortened.

I could see that was going to happen before I even tried it.  It's just a flimsy thin piece of sheet metal.  Anyone who has shucked raw oysters knows how much torque it takes and how rigid the blade needs to be.  Apparently these guys don't know anything about that.  Shame on &quot;OXO/Good Grips&quot; for calling this thing an oyster knife,1
1001,Not Worth the Money. I bought this thinking that it would work better than scooping kitty litter into a small trash bag and tying it off and then placing it in the trash.  I was WRONG.  This does not hold much waste and takes up un-necessary space.  If you want to buy something for your soiled kitty litter get a diaper genie and throw your trash bags of waste in that.  I have three cats and have to empty this Litter keeper at least every other day.  I wish I never bought it,1

But it kept turning itself off until my husband figured out that you could stand over it, pushing the cover down to keep it going.  It wasn't because we had not put the top on properly--it needed the extra pressure.  I don't know if it was a defect in our unit or in the design but I suspect the design.And the grind settings were way off.  We had to use the finest setting all the time and even then, the grind was a mix of crumbs and flakes.  Sad! You might as well have a $19 blade grinder.After dropping it off at the post office we went to Starbucks and bought their burr grinder for $88.

1005,"Does what it claims, but takes forever. This product does what it claims.  I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well.  The downside of the product is the size.  It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it.  They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more.  I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator.  I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal.  It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat",1

1031,"stay away from this humidifier. This product seemed to have been designed by someone who had never used a humidifier before. The water tank is nearly impossible to fill; there's nothing to hold on to once the tank is upside down, and the opposite end is sloped so you can't rest it against the bottom of your bathtub while it fills. Once it's full, a juggling act is required in order to screw on the tank lid, since you can't set the tank down anywhere. After trying twice and only succeeding in spilling water all over myself and the bathroom, I left this task for my husband to take care of, as he has very large hands and was able to fill the tank more easily, although he too complained that the tank was so poorly designed.The tank capacity is too small; to keep my bedroom at a good humidity level, we have to refill the tank twice a day. Still, the thing did what it was meant to do--humidified the room--until after three weeks the full tank leaked all over the wood floor and area rug. We thought the top must not have been screwed on correctly, but it happened again, warping the wood floor. Leaving the full tank in the bathtub, it didn't leak at all, which made us think that something had gone wrong with the base.I didn't waste my time trying to get this thing fixed. I returned it",1

I really like its compact size, the ability to choose grind and to just press the button so I could fill my coffee maker with water while it ground.

However, after about six months of daily use, the plastic which holds the metal cup and blades to the body broke, rendering the grinder useless.  I was very disappointed.

1046,"Barely Acceptable. This toaster oven is nicely styled on its exterior, but its pleasures end there.The box loudly trumpets ""Stainless Steel"" in its ad copy, and it's true that some is used on the appliance.  It's on the top of the outer shell- just where it will catch the most kitchen grease and dirt and be hardest to keep clean, with painted metal and plastic everywhere else. Inside, stainless is not used at ALL- the rack is cheap chrome-plate, and the crumb tray and baking pan are that weird silicone-finish ""non-stick"" over steel.  This material cannot be scrubbed, because to do so will breach the silicone coating, allowing the steel underneath to rust.  I did this accidentally with a plastic-mesh Teflon scrubber- the coating is obviously very fragile.The feel of the controls is shaky and vague; the knobs wobble a bit, and their detents are not very positive, so you don't get a satisfying ""click"" feel that tells you that you've reached a given setting. The timer must be used for all functions; though it has a ""stay on"" setting, there is no way to avoid its use as there is on other toaster ovens.  My guess is that this timer is going to wear out faster than the ones on other units I've had.Toasting performance is not great; each slice is unevenly browned, and there is a lot of variation between slices in front and rear. Baking performance is okay, but unlike my former Munsey toaster oven, this bulky toaster oven will not take a 9"" round Pyrex pie plate- it touches the glass door. I'm concerned that the hot pie plate might create a hot spot that could crack the glass door, so I don't use this unit for some of the minor baking jobs my former unit excelled at.This unit might be okay for someone who has never had a large toaster oven before, but of all that I've owned or used, this one has been the biggest disappointment.  I'm especially taken aback at the squandering of stainless steel as a decorative element outside, when it- or something else that is both rustproof and easy to clean- is so sorely needed inside to contribute to the longevity of the appliance",1

1052,"Teflon Bonding Failure. Within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off. This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect.This is my third (and final) bread machine. The first two were Breadman Ultimates. I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average, pretty much every morning.The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. This was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond).I bought an new Breadman Ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. This time I took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down, no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed, making the machine useless. Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman.At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one.Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect.I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate:1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much.2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense.3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs.4) The programmability options are very limited:- You can't control the knockdown time between risings.- You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings.- You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle.- When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones.- And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a ""safety feature"" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion.For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations.At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology.All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination.A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution.I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology. It's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution",1

Sometimes we would get one beep & it would just stop. We tried to place the transmitter in three different locations today and each gave poor results. There were areas between flags placed 6 feet apart that we never heard a beep and could just keep on walking. I am more than willing to spend the time training my dog but I could not even set the boundaries.

1066,"Works, but safety concerns. As others have noted, the outer case gets very hot. I decided to take it apart to understand why. The removable stoneware sits in an inner aluminum pot surrounded by the outer metal case. The pot and case are held together by a screw, spacer, washers, and nuts through the bottom of the pot. A lip around the top of the pot wraps around the top edge of the case, and 3 legs under the pot contact the bottom of the case. The heating element wraps around the bottom of the sides of the pot. The handles and temp control are attached to the outer housing. There are several metal-to-metal contact points between the pot and outer housing. The screw, legs of the pot, and upper lip conduct heat from the pot to the outer housing. Since the base is metal and does not have insulated feet, I recommend placing the unit on a heat-resistant surface away from combustables, flammables, and exposed skin when in use.The handles and control knob feel sturdy, but time will tell whether they will crack from the heat. The switch body is also plastic and is mounted very close to the heating element. The inner wiring is wrapped in insulated fabric sleeves, but they are in contact with the housing.The 3ft power cord is permanently attached and is unusually stiff. I have to form it into shape before plugging it in, and I don't coil it up between uses.The package I received from Amazon did not include the 200 page recipe book. There were some recipes in the owner's guide and a couple of recipes on the box. A 4-page slow cooker accessory catalog was included showing cookbooks, travel bags, bread/cake bake pan, meat rack, dust cover, liner bags for sale.UPDATE: The outer case was recalled by the manufacturer because of several cases of cracked handles.

Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman.At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one.Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect.I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate:1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much.2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense.3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs.4) The programmability options are very limited:- You can't control the knockdown time between risings.- You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings.- You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle.- When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones.- And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a ""safety feature"" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion.For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations.At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology.All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination.A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution.I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology. It's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution",1

My husband and I tested the device before placing it on our dog (if it beeps when the sensors are run over a rough surface, it's supposed to be working)  and waited to see what the dog's reaction would be.  For about an hour he didn't bark at all, but every now and then the collar would beep, then he'd shake his head and scratch at the collar, as if it were irritating.  We thought he was just getting used to the feel of the collar.  About 90 minutes after we placed the collar on the dog, he was munching on a rawhide toy not barking, growling or anything, when he leapt into the air about 3 feet, yelped and started crying and frantically running around. We chased him to try to hold him and take the collar off. But before we could catch him he was shocked again because he jumped into the air a second time and yelped.  We finally caught him and took the collar off. The instructions say the dog's first reaction to the shock will be the strongest, and we expected he would have some discomfort and be surprised but the dog WAS NOT BARKING when he was shocked.",1

1107,"hard to clean. In my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems. My main beef is it's too hard to clean. A few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up. It has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank. Soaking in vinegar doesn't do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled. The (phosporic-acid based) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing. And there's the hitch! You can't reach parts of the element, not even with a toothbrush. Why they couldn't center it just a little further away from the edge of the ""wall"" is beyond my comprehension.

1139,"DO NOT BUY. I previously reviewed this product and had nothing but great things to say about it.  My opinion has now changed, after owning it for a few months I have had nothing but problems.  The first thing to break was the self propel.  Then the on and off switch quit working, it just stays on, to turn it off you have to unplug it.  Now, it keeps throwing the circuit breaker to my house when you plug it in(brand new house).  It is still under warranty, but Hoover says that I have to take it in, and they will only pay the bill if it is their fault.  I don't want  to take the chance in what they preceive is their fault.  This vacuum cleaner should be recalled, I can not imagine it is very safe if it will not even turn off.  I just threw away alot of money, and now have to go buy a new vacuum cleaner",1

For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again",1

1143,"My continuing crusade against gizmos:. There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get",1

It's way overpriced in my opinion but they are onto a very good idea.First, I have had it for a couple of weeks and it's pretty flat now.  The coils are only in the very center of the pillow, and at times you do notice them there, but not in a bad way, just noticable.  The problem is the fluff they add to the pillow must be the cheapest possible nothing.  I imagine I will have a really strange looking square blob surrounded by a moat of flat fabric pretty soon.At first, it was really comfy. I think that if they either put high quality fluff around it, or better yet put coils through the entire thing, with higher ones in the center, this would be outstanding, beyond all other pillows!  But as it is, it's not worth the price yet.If you have tons of money to burn, go ahead and try it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone get two to sleep on at once, they would be awkward and they would be falling off the sides of eachother.  You could use a regular pillow below this one, but then you are back into the same pillow finding - switching game we all want to avoid.I would have given three stars if it were a lot cheaper, but after going flat after only a few weeks, and the price, I had to give it two",1

As it nears being done the liquid spatters out the air hole all over my countertop. What a mess! I threw away the packing materials or I would probably return it.

1170,"This can't even grind pre-ground hamburger!. This product is terrible. It's the only thing that I've ever returned to Amazon because it simply dosen't work.I bought it because I bought a small pate terrine, and I was looking for something to grind small amounts of chicken livers, pork and so on. I was dubious -- it seemed to kind of cheesy. But I thought that as long as it basically worked, it was fine.I put in some chicken breasts for a pate recipe, and those were fine. But the, I put in some pork. It squished up in the machine and couldn't come out. It got stuck and I had to remove the mincing plate. I tried the larger plate. The same thing happened. Essentially, any meat with even a small amount of fat can't be ground in this machine. It has only a small, not very sharp grinder blade element. Given that the meat you'd tend to grind would be for the likes of sausages, pates and for hamburger, it makes this machine useless. I actually had some hamburger in my fridge. Just for fun, I tried putting that through the machine. It also didn't work on that -- and it was ALREADY ground!!I thought, OK, I'll try it for some pasta. Maybe that will redeem it enough to keep it. No way. The engineering on a playdoh machine is better. The dough comes out and immediately tangles with whatever comes out of it. It also just gets stuck and refuses to move through the machine. There's no way to make any kind of ""strands"" of pasta. I tried three separate pasta recipes. I am a culinary school graduate, and a professional cook -- i know how to make pasta. This machine just doesn't work. Then, I went to clean it up. It took 40 minutes, using a skewer and Q-tips to get the pasta out of the little holes.The suction cup device that is supposed to hold it onto a counter works only temporarily. It seems sturdy, but then you start to crank and it comes right off. The sausage funnel is way too small to actually use for sausage.It sort of works for nuts, but then, I can use a coffee grinder for that.Take my advice -- get the right machine for the job. Get a cast iron meat grinder; they sell them on Amazon. Get a separate pasta machine, the stainless steel kind that breaks the pasta down into sheets of thickness. If you want to make baby food, get a good quality food mill.I think this is the most disappointed I've been in a product in a long time -- and I didn't expect much! Stay away from this product",1

When I received this item I immediatley knew that something would be wrong.The box it was packaged in and delivered in was open and torn up.Not open like someone opened it I mean it was sent in a box with no bottom and no side, just taped together with styrofoam.I opened it and thought well it maybe ok, this is a big item to send. The right front wheel is off balance from the rest so the whole machine wobbles, the back panel had puncture marks in it and was off level from the rest of the machine. I thought jeez what have I bought. So I thought well I will hook it up and use it,see how it does. It ran beautifully and cleaned my dishes cleaner than I have ever seen them. At that point I thought well the damage is in the back and the wheel doesn not cause it to wobble while it is running so I will just be grateful I finally have a dishwasher. As I was unhooking it from the sink the ball bearings that hold the connector piece in place fell out and down my sink. So I spent 2 days trying to call the company and get a replacement piece or something. NOTHING NO ANSWER AT ALL....Even during the times they SAy they are in the office there is still no answer. So I searched online and in stores for this piece. NOWHERE!!! Danby is not even registered at Sears or Maytag ar any big dishwasher supplier for that matter. HELL all of the actual plumbing repair stores did not have the piece I needed. I was told over and over again, no one really uses that hook up anymore ma'am, or ""Wow what an ancient piece"". So I went online and had to order a $90.00 hose and hook up from GE. Once it came in I realized it was not compatble with this Danby dishwasher. So I spent another week trying to call Danby and still NO ANSWER. Finally my husband cut the tubes from the dishwasher and used hose clamps and metal nipples to piece the dishwasher hoses and the new GE hookup together. I did have to go out and buy a new adapter for my sink as the Danby one does not work with the GE. But now the dishwasher works and it still cleans beautifully. The GE hookup is made with little plastic nudules that cannot fall out instead of ball bearings which if you are not careful will fall down your sink. So I would have liked to give this product a 1 or even a 0 based on customer service (NONE) and the way that the item was packaged and the way it arrived so damaged, BUT the dishwasher does slean so very well. You dont even have to rinse the plates before you put them in and they still come out sparkly. So all in all I WOULD NEVER EVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. If you add up the cost of the dishwasher and shipping, plus all the money it took to repair it, I could have gotten a much higher quality dishwasher with no problems at all for less than what this dishwasher cost me in the  end.",1

One of the two dogs appeared interested, but quickly became confused and just stood in the middle of the circle looking at me quizzically. Maybe a really simple-minded pet will like this, but mine aren't interested. I tried putting the device on the floor, a shelf, the coffee table, and other locations looking for a way to get the critters to take interest.

However, on top of being poorly engineered, it is poorly built.  Maybe that's an up-side.  I can't wait for mine to break.  It comes dangerously close everytime I need to interact with it.

I hope you will listen and not waste your hard earned money",1
1195,"Worst grinder I've ever used. --and I've used a LOT of grinders. VERY badly designed, and the ""custom"" thing is a gimmick and a sham: it's a standard rotary grinder. They just added flashing lights and extra buttons, and made it look bulkier. Every day was a misery dealing with this thing: it's designed so that you have no choice but to spill grinds all over the place when you use it",1
1196,Dead Flowers. Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday.  Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun.  My father tried to contact them and nobody responded.  I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund.I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist,1
1197,"TINY Bookstand. After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs.  Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was.  This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back.  Any of my school books are not stably supported.    I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages.  Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00).  Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you.",1
1198,Overpriced. This item is really overprice for a piece of wood with slots.Cheaply made in China. You can buy the 19 slot version for $39.95 on Amazon,1
1199,Poor Design. Evidently the people at Krups didn't try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market. The caraffe is hard to take out and put back in. It scrapes the lid every time. They say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer? You need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee. You never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe. Also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups. I'm sure this is the last Krup's product I will buy.,1
1200,"Not Durable. I'm currently looking for another crate pan for my dogs wire Midwest crate.  The plastic pan is not durable at all.  The first crack appeared when my dog (Boxer) was only 5 months old.  Now she is 18 months and the pan has several cracks in it.  Luckily she doesn't have any accidents while being crated!!  I'm just now replacing it because the local pet stores in my area, including Petsmart, doesn't carry them in their store.  I'm told everywhere I go to check online.  In my opinion the crate pans are way too expensive to have to keep replacing them",1
1201,Rigal GR250 Griddle. I would not recommend buying this griddle...the non-stick surface burned through the first time I used it making pancakes at 375 degrees...I tried treating the surface again with additional oil before cooking pancakes again at 350 degrees...the surface deteriorated even further and the third time I made pancakes they stuck badly to the surface and I gave up...I am going back to my cast iron griddle,1
1202,"Product 5 STARS, Packing -3 STARS, Hassle -1 STAR. Great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken. Amazon, how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn't pack them well enough for shipping?Amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an Amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go. Any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic. I've received two of those lovely surprises, the first set I ordered and the replacement set. Oh boy, I give up!The canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them. Just imagine the UPS guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard. THEY BREAK!Amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement (in this case) so it's like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage. Are you feeling lucky??? If so then roll the dice",1

I searched soley for ""Electric blankets"" and when this came up over and over, I thought I would try it for the price.  It is NOT electric, but that is the category I found it in--and still find it in.  ""Queen size, electric blankets only.""  Other than that, it is way too expensive for a nonelectric blanket--and probably way too inexpensive had it been electric!  I just don't want anyone else to be mistaken.  It may work out, but I did not need another regular blanket and it is not very soft.  Good luck shopping",1
1207,"Not loud enough to get your attention. I have sold a number of this style timer made by KitchenAid in Pink , Black and White. Almost every buyer complained. All complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room, have a fan on or are listening to the TV or radio. Replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either. If you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the Red, Black, Blue, White or Tangerine ones that are entitled Digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of KitchenAid timers.",1

I had questions and had a very difficult time finding a service company who knew anything about this Haier machine. I called customer service over five times and had to have corporate refer me to a company in Indiana. Nobody I knew has had a combo, and it has been frustrating dealing with the company. I also did not know I could not return this product. I honestly regret getting this machine; it is pricey and not worth it. I was looking forward to the space saving option, but I rather have no machine than face the hassles and headaches. I read a few negative reviews and do not look forward to the troubles ahead.",1

With 3 indoor cats and a cat allergy, I needed something that would get the fur off the furniture easily.  This does NOT do it.Like everyone else, I was sure something was wrong with mine because the brushes stopped every time I put the attachment on my sofa.  I finally went and bought a Eureka Power Paw ($20) that actually works the way the Mini Turbine tool is supposed to and fits on my Dyson!  Don't spend the money on this - go by the Power Paw",1

1216,"Very deceptive listing. I wish I had read the other review before I bought this item. The listing is very deceptive on all of these strainer products as they indicate the length of the item (who cares!?!) rather than the diameter of the strainer. Needless to say I am not a happy puppy! I wanted an 11"" strainer and got a 5"" strainer! How disappointing",1
1217,"Fantastic. Don't buy this fan, unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed.  Also, if it has green lights(like my blizzard fan did), it will light up a dark room at night.

I just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser, but a month later (3 months after original purchase), the thing is spewing soap non-stop.  Wasted lots of soap this way.  Changing the batteries didn't help.  Soap just flows out until there's none left.  To maintain some customer satisfaction, Sharper Image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control",1
1223,"leaky, unstable steamer. It looks fancy in the picture.  The panel is actually hard to read.  The steam penetrates through the panel and thus make it blurry and leaks/steams out.  It has an unstable base.  Bought three.  Opened one.  Returned three",1

The trouble is that they are folded so tightly in their ""bag"" they actually stretch (apparently permanently).  They will not lay flat on a hardwood floor -- even after a week or two.  One is under a relatively lightweight handmade rug, but the other is under a very dense and heavy (~ 150 lb) handmade rug; both have ""mountains"" that don't go away and are a tripping hazard.I have a cheaper pad from a department store rug shop that has been perfect for 10 years (under another rug) -- we brought it home ""rolled"" and it has been smooth and wrinkle-free from day one.

Just know what you're getting and you won't be disappointed.",1
1232,"buy a different brand - 1 star is too many for this one. Dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them.  The device I received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity, some don't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them.  I had a chance to try a different brand years ago and I know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison.  If you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten.  There you go, suicide by dog, that's a good use for it.  May be it is just quality control, you might get lucky,  if not then you might have to deal with a seller that won't return calls or e-mail, like i did.  So you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad.  Go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones.

However, the quality of the materials ""Egyptian Cotton"" is far less satisfactory.

1241,"Nice Unit But.... The Rival Slicer (Model 1060C) is a generally well designed unit.   I say generally because there appears, in my unqualified opinion, to be one major design and/or manufacturing flaw associated with the product.The first unit I received had a broken speed control knob that prevented any speed adjustment.  This unit was exchanged (thank you Amazon for making that process painlessly easy) for another.  This second unit also had a broken speed control knob, the failure point being identical to the first.  The stem on the speed control knob is either woefully under designed or it is being forced into the wrong position (it has a detent) during assembly.  This is really too bad since the unit looks like it would do the job for which it is intended quite well.What's good about this product:- heavy-duty construction (parts I expected to be plastic are made from cast aluminum)- heavy-duty, thick stainless steel blade - removable for cleaning- angled slicing surface- tray to catch the slices of what ever- cuts up to 5/8"" slices- integrated cutting boardWhat's not so good about this product:- There are rubber suction cups on the four bottom corners to protect the surface the unit is sitting on and hold it in place while it's being used.  This would be a great feature except that the suction cups stick to the surface and pull out of the unit when it is lifted up.- the speed control knob as stated above (and sole reason for number 1 rating)",1

We had to use Barkeeper's friend to clean all the rust out. We've tried to clean and dry the knives immediatly after every use - real pain in the #*@ - but once in a while one will be forgotten for couple hours and then rust immediatly forms. Once, when someone else was helping clean up, one went into the dishwasher. It didn't only have rust all over but the blade edge rusted away! Now the knife has jagged edge!!!

1253,"Dogs will pay attention to this..but.. it requires effort from owners.  Bought this to help control our Sheltie's barking behavior.  When we first tried it, he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from.  We noticed that this alone wouldn't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'No' or 'Quiet'. This  meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much.  They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands.  So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here.Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either.  My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean.  Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order.My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention.My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself.

After receiving my second teapot, it was cracked in the exact same spot. I returned the product and complained with no response.

1256,"Poor Ergonomics. The unit works well.  Nevertheless, it is poorly designed. I don't mean that it doesn't look good-it's really beautiful.  The problem arises when filling/refilling the tank.  The tank must be removed from the base, turned upside down, (before turning it over the mist outlet cap must be removed and put aside) the water tank cap (with the demineralization cartridge attached) removed and put aside before it can be filled.  While it's in the upside-down position for refilling it must be held firmly since the top (now on the bottom) is not flat. After replacing the tank cap the now full tank must be turned right side up and reinstalled onto the base.It's not a user friendly task.  There a very good chance that when refilling the tank you will drip water on the path from wherever it's kept to where it's filled and, again on the return to the base unit.Incidentally, the unit should not be placed on the floor.  It's supposed to be placed in an elevated position on a table or bench - to avoid the mist staining the floor.It's too bad that the guys who designed this probably never used one in their own home.  If they did it would probably have the filer cap on the top.  That simple change would make the unit much more user friendly.Incidentally, the product is described as  ""3.5 Gal."". I don't know what that refers to.  The actual tank capacity is much less than that (about 2 1/2 gallons). It's probably an estimate of how much water it will put out as mist in 24 hours.

First the amount of fluid that it can hold is pathetic compared to the old Cuisinart. The Kitchenaid leaked like a sieve via the gap between the lid and the bowl.

The cup and saucer were much thicker than I would have expected for a china teacup!  It also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer.  I sent it back as I could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup",1

1269,"Not a winner. First off, this machine LOOKS great.  But unfortunately, that's where the attraction ends. You see, I too used a little Krups $45 espresso machine for years. But it was a heck of a lot easier to use, and made consistently better espresso/cappucinno than this dog.  Here's a brief synopsis.The reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days.  I'm constantly refilling it.  After making an espresso, the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end, making a mess of the whole machine.  The steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam.  The lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion. And positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome.Did I mention the thing leaks? Now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino............... it doesn't",1
1270,"Strange deposits and other malfunctions. We bought this stand mixer in September 2006, and from the first time we used it we noticed a silvery-gray deposit on the batter when it was scraped from the bowl (both bowls).  Thinking it was some coating on the new bowls, we washed and scrubbed them thoroughly--still same thing.  We thought it may be some oil coming from the motor and escaping from where the beaters are mounted, but that doesnt seem to be the case.  About the 4th time we used it the center beater jammed and cannot be removed--it is abiut 1/3"" from being locked in place and wont budge.  While struggling to remove it, some grayish powder came falling out--maybe that's where the deposits are from.  Anyway, I wish we hadnt bought this product and would advise you to find another option",1

Either it doesn't spin at all or it almost blows the spray attachment off the top.4) The pump gets clogged up with gunge. And yes - I followed all instructions very carefully, changed the water frequently and washed out the device.5) The sprouts are hard to harvest as their leaves and roots get stuck in the trays.Definitely get into sprouting - it's great!

1274,"I disagree with Jackie on this one!  Stay Away from Cerama Bryte!. I bought Cerama Bryte and their Stainless Steel Cleaner with all the gadgets and bought in bulk 6 bottles of each.  I paid for the whole shipment over $97 with shipping.The Cerama Bryte does not work at all on taking the spots or the overflow of the water when your boiling potatoes and it boils on to the cooktop.  This was a real waste of good money.  The stainless steel cleaner is just ok.  I was willing to spend the money for a real good cleaner to keep my very expensive new Italian made stainless steel range with the sealed ceramic cooktop that cost me over $2250 US.After I found that the Cerama Bryte did not give me good results I started searching the internet for other ways to clean the ceramic stovetop without scratching or damaging it.  Here is my recommendation:By a can of Bar Keepers Friend (non-abrasive cleaning powder for about $1.19 a can) and the Mr. Clean Magic erasers.  Wet your ceramic cooktop with a little water and put a couple of teaspoons of the Bar Keepers Friend powder.  Put a little bit of water on your Mr. Clean magic eraser and then lightly rub all the powder and water with the eraser.  After a couple of minutes wipe off the paste with a sponge and get it so it is nearly clean.  Finish off with Windex Streak-Free and a paper towel and you have a beautiful clean ceramic cooktop just like it was new.So I have my cleaning cabinet full of this cerama bryte cleaner, treated wipes, stainless steel cleaner and treated wipes as well and I am going to give it to anyone who wants to pick it up.  If not gone in the next month it is all going out with the trash for pickup.Worst cleaning product I have ever used is Cerama Bryte",1

The short attachment was too short and the long attachment was way too long so I had to cut it.  The pump is not strong enough to pull the water up through the attachment no matter how much I cut it and even with it off, the pump had major problems.  The product just did not perform as the manufacturer or other customers had testified to.  It was way loud and kept up my kids atnight who slept in the next room.  I was not impressed and changed back to the free filter that came with the tank - the Tetra Whisper brand",1
1279,"A Big Disappointment. We ordered one of these from Amazon, but when they were out of stock for several weeks, we decided to get it elsewhere. We kept it for only 2 days before we realized it was a big mistake, and sent it back. We have had a series of less expensive espresso machines for about 10 years now. Our first few were the cheapo steam models, and then we moved up to a low-end Briel pump-type. It worked okay but started to leak after a few years, so we decided to try another brand.Our main complaint about the Gaggia Espresso is that we could not get decent crema out of it at all, and it was way too hard to use. It comes with a little rubber disc called a ""Perfect Crema"", which you are supposed to insert in the portafilter under the filter basket to make crema. Well, with that disc in place, it was next to impossible to make the portafilter go into the machine because the filter basket would not push down far enough into the portafilter holder. We finally jammed it in once after a huge amount of effort, and got decent crema, but the next time, after we had removed it to clean it (quite a procedure in itself to pry it out), we couldn't get it back in again. Without that disc it makes okay-tasting coffee, but no crema at all. It certainly did not seem worth the effort to us to attempt this hassle every time we make espresso (which we do at least twice a day), since you are supposed to remove and clean the crema disc after each use.I also agree with the person who said the construction is kind of cheap. The first one we got arrived with the plastic water tank shattered, which makes me wonder how long it would last in daily use and regular cleaning.We ultimately got a Krups XP 4000 (I believe this is a new model), which is the same price as the Gaggia Espresso. So far (after about a week) we are quite happy with the Krups. It's much simpler to use, and makes excellent espresso.Incidentally, I don't want to mention the exact name of the company where we got the machine we returned, since it might not be permitted by Amazon, but you will see this place advertised all over the web for selling espresso makers. They have a pretty good web site, but I wouldn't recommend dealing with them, as they have been very slow in crediting our account for the returned machine.",1

It had everything I was looking for, and I was astonished it didn't sell for twice as much - definitely a professional quality build on the outside.HOWEVER, Breville must have poor quality control.  After 20 minutes on the grill, chicken filets were still white, not a bit of browning anywhere.  I had it on sear (420 degrees).  So, I took my candy thermometer and placed it between the two grill plates, closed the lid, and let is sit for 20 minutes.  The temperature was 220 degrees rather than the 420 degrees it says it cooks at.  Needless to say, unless you want to grill or boil water, nothing is going to cook.This was my first Breville product and will be my last.  Obviously quality control is not a concern otherwise they would have caught that this machine has thermostat problems.  It's a shame such a finely built, heavy machine (cosmetically) can't heat any hotter than an aquarium heater.  I was very disappointed.  I am returning it this weekend",1

As to my experience: I don't have memory of mine ever working properly. I bought this a few years ago, and had it in storage, not having need for it at that time.

I decided that I didn't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so I'm returning it - it's not worth the risk. I can't figure out if it's coming from the ""stainless steel"" bulb  (that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass & the bulb.

I make one for her almost every morning befoe I go to work. I had been using these egg rings, which you lay down on a hot frying pan. They work sorta ok. But egg always leaks out because either no frying pan in completly flat, or the rings are not. I have not ever figured it out. Then along comes this pan. Seems to be the perfect size for the pefect round egg. And really, it is! The egg cooks up fine, especially if you keep the flame on low, which on most gas burners give you a flame ring the size of the bottom of the pan. This also seems to be just the right amount of btu's for proper cooking. Turning the egg over is a problem, but not a huge one. Best option is to let the egg do 90% of it's cooking on the first side, then use your smallest spatula to turn it over for the last 10 or 15 seconds of cooking. There is one fatal flaw to this pan. It is the handle! For starters, it is of an almost useless shape, too wide and too flat to hold comfortably, were the second problem not evident-the handle gets just about as hot as the pan! Now the makers have seen fit to afix a goofy egg character on the end of the handle, I suppose to insulate your hand from it's cooking temperature surface , but alas, it gets just about as hot as well. Having said all that, I still use the pan every day because it is the only one of it's size I have been able to find.

The other half of the time, it does not vacuum up the dirty water, so it leaves the floor dirtier than before I ""cleaned"" it.

I bit the bullet, spent way more money than I wanted to, and ordered this toaster. I like the way it looks and I like that it doesn't 'pop-up', you can check the toast anytime that you want and return it to toasting with the cool lever.  However, I wish I returned it. It is slow, it is a pain to plug in before each use (must be unplugged when not being used), and worse of all :  it does NOT toast evenly!  Top is burnt, bottom is not even toasted at all, or one slice is done perfect and the other slice is like it was never put into the toaster. This toaster would be a waste of money at $9.99, it should be illegal to charge $200. for it.  That said, Amazon's price of 200. was a better deal than William Sanoma's at 299., but I am still sooooo disappointed in this purchase.  Upon re-reading the other reviews I find that the people that purchased 'refurbished' models seem more pleased with their purchase.

The overall exterior construction is pleasant, with a nice appearance and a few sheet metal screws located to easily allow access to the mechanism. Unfortunately, the mechanism itself is set up such that it indicates gross amounts reasonably well, but fine amounts poorly. For example, if you want to quickly see if you have about 2 pounds of potatoes, the scale is great for that. On the other hand, if you have 8 ounces of grain on the scale and you'd like to add another ounce, you won't know until you've added too much and the indicator finally overcomes the built-in friction necessary to move, at which point it will show that you've added a few ounces. There's also a kink in the mechanism at 2.5 lbs which the unit has to overcome, again blocking fine gradients from being measured in that area to an even greater extent than around other points on the scale. Overall, not a unit I'd recommend.",1

Of course, the magnets fall off when you're not even close to the rack.

1306,"Good, but horrendously expensive. I will give one thing to the Litter Locker: it works, and works well.  Odor is controlled better than any other system that I have tried.  BUT, it is also horrendously expensive, and I suspect that is no accident.  Overall, it is probably not worth it unless you have lots of excess cash to get rid of.The cheapest price I found online for litter locker refill cartridges was $8 (but many places were as much as $14!).  This will last you two weeks with a single cat of average size.  So let us do the math:  $8 every other week is 26 cartridges per year, plus the $30 cost of the locker itself gives us a MINIMUM of $238 for your first year, and $208 for every year thereafter.  Unfortunately, I have 2 cats, and the litter locker is going to cost me $446 in one year!  Or, I should more accurately say it will NOT cost me that much, because I refuse to pay that much.Obviously these guys have a racket going.  The locker could easily be designed with twice the capacity, and the refill cartridges could certainly be sold for much less.  But this is the same old gimmick that razor companies have been playing for years: get a consumer to buy their particular razor, then charge a premium for the replacement blades.  The profit is made on the blades, not the razor itself.  Likewise with the litter locker: the companys profit lies with the exorbitantly priced refill cartridges",1

What's better than a toy that mops floors?  Trouble is, the unit did not function ... would not spray the cleaning solution after about 3 feet of travel.  I called iRobot Customer Service and they had me squirting water into valves and passageways trying to flush out the system.  No luck.  I visited a Scooba internet discussion forum board and read all the posts, and discovered that I was not alone.  It would seem that a pretty high percentage of machines do not function right out of the box.Being unable to get the machine to work, I paid to send the unit back to iRobot, and they sent a new one.  THE NEW UNIT DID NOT PERFORM EITHER.  Again, called iRobot Customer Service and they had me squirting water into valves and passages, cleaning this, adjusting that ... all to no avail.  This time iRobot emailed me a UPS shipping label to send the unit back.  I made sure that the customer service agent understood that I expected to receive a functional unit this time.  It must work right out of the box.  No excuses.The THIRD machine arrived at it too did not function properly.  It would dry up after about 3-6 feet of travel.  I visited the web discussion forum again and did A LOT of reading.  I have performed many checks and flushes with this unit, finally discovering that the clean water tank does not vent properly (forms a vacuum after a little water is pumped out) and no cleaning solution will flow.  Today I left the clean tank filler cap off when I started the machine and it seems to be working just fine.When it works, it works great.My issue is why should I have to engineer workaround solutions for this machine's shortcomings?  IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT A $300 MACHINE FUNCTION PROPERLY STRIAGHT OUT OF THE BOX?  I don't have to do carbureator adjustments on my new car.  I didn't have to engineer repairs on my new central vacuum system when it was installed.  New should mean ""perfectly functional"", shouldn't it?By the way, DON'T ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON.  If you get frustrated with the Scooba and want to return the machine, you won't be able to after 30 days.  Read the Amazon return policy!  My suggestion: order from Hammacher Schlemmer.  You'll pay a little more, but they have a lifetime return policy, no questions asked.  (So what is ""lifetime"" for a Scooba? Hammacher gives the Scooba 4-years).

I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light",1

Plus, thehole that the pegs fit into the bottom piece was not drilled in enough so he also had to drill a wider hole.  Not to happy with the poor job they did on manufacturing these tables.  Maybe we just got a bad one I dont know, but it sure was difficult to match up pieces with the holes!  And putting the baskets together, thats another story!!  Very frustrating!  Table looks great in my home just a pain in the bum to assemble!!  For all you single woman out there, FORGET IT!!!!",1

The reset never functioned @ all, heating element failed - essentially a total meltdown.  Called DeLonghi, they requested I send the unit to a service center in New Mexico which I did.  A month later, no unit, no response from service center",1

It doesn't fit togehter right because the dimesnions of the cheap card board don't line up to where its supposed to snap together.I'd rather suggest lighting a 10 dollar bill on fire.  At least you will be more entertained by watching the bill burn then you will be by trying to put this thing together and then throwing it in the trash can afterwards.Hopefully, one day companies will give us decent DVD storage.  However, don't give your money to this company trying to rape the consumer with their extremely over-priced junk",1
1319,Coffee Mug not so great. I ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof.  The coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when I tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me.  It is a very frustrating mug to drink from.  The only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot.,1

I checked the temperature with my old candy thermometer (with the mercury) and it said it was over 390 F.  So, I took out the other one and tried to make another batch of toffee.  This time I used both this thermometer and my old candy one.  Again, this digital thermometer was always low.  So, I am returning the both of these digital thermometers.  Maybe they work well for meat but I don't want to risk it!  I am very disappointed",1

There's no room to use a spatula, so you'd better like the eggs cooked through - you can't flip for over easy, and the egg white is too deep to do sunny-side up. Also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip, so you have to use a potholder. Plus, it's so small that it won't fit any normal-sized burner - another burn risk to your fingers",1

The typical grease splatters and other messy situations you'll find in a kitchen make them look bad pretty quickly.  Plus, as other reviewers have mentioned, the plastic liner/seal is worthless.  Don't plan to use these as functional canisters -- they're decoration only.  After a year, I threw them away.  What a shame, especially because they seemed so good at the beginning",1

It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up",1

The lid didn't fit because the pot was out of round, but I could squeeze the pot back into shape - now that's thin metal!

Then I tried the 9oz setting with again two pods (as is suggested for a ""strong"" cup of coffee). Swill. I am not blaming the folgers pods (I dont think) because I have had good cups of folgers from my old auto drip, but something is awry. I will be returning this immediately and stopping off at starbucks to cleanse that horrible taste from my mouth. I guess I got what I piad for",1

For the first couple of months, i had no problems with it, but recently, i've noticed QUITE frequently that the light would not come on, or turn off.  Upon closer inspection of the timer, i noticed that the time was not moving.  i would go to bed at night, with it set to 1130, and in the morning, it was still 1130 pm - hadn't moved AT ALL.  i would fix the time and the light would come on, and when i would get home from work, i would check it again, and guess what?  it was still 8 am, sometimes it would have made it to noon, or some other afternoon hour, but it's never the right time.  i realize it only costs $7, but my recommendation is to go with a different brand...preferably one that works!",1

Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a ""blue juice special"". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar.

Once they are in place on the bed you can't move them!  Try lifting them when you change the sheets!!!  But, you probably bought them due to a bad back, neck or shoulders and now you have to lift these weights to make the bed!  What was I thinking?  I was lucky I didn't wind up in traction from lifting these things.  My husband refused to use it after a few weeks, said he couldn't get comfortable and was unable to move it easily (they weigh a ton!)  I hung in there longer but wound up using a regular pillow on top of it just to be able to adjust it without having to get a crane to lift it.  We honestly didn't feel any better sleeping on it and having to deal with the weight of them was not worth any benefits we might have derived.  No one mentions this issue in their reviews, I have to wonder if they all have maid service",1

The block that came with my 15 piece set was pretty nice, and I ordered this block to house the additional knives that I bought. It appears to be the same design, but the quality control is awfull. Several glue joints were split open when I recieved the block, and the finish was not quite up to par. Given the low cost, I chose to glue and clamp the block into submission, rather than to send it back, but you  might be better off buying a more expensive block to start with",1

In other words, if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so (according to the thermometer reading) in less 2 minutes and stop. If you do not use this functionality, but instead let the heater run for some time (5-10 minutes) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees. The thermometer is probably in the wrong location. Did Honeywell do any kind of testing before putting this model on the market ?",1

When compared to a generic grinder, this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds. I've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them. With this grinder you'll always get a huge variation in the grind. Some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish. The oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable, you'll have trouble turning it. Not recommended",1

But when I switch it from on to off, it shouldn't ding also!4.  The on/off light indicator is impossible to see unless you're in pitch darkness.   Seems like a hazard to me.5.

1354,"Probably not suitable for household use... As other reviewers had pointed out, you have to clean this vacuum pretty often. The vacuum is not good at handling lint and small particles, and I happen to have a lot of those in my apartment. What happens is that lint would clog the preliminary filter made of a metallic net, and fine dust ends up clogging HEPA filter. These dirt have no where to go but to stay on the filter, which have very small surface area, so overall the performance is worse than a bagged vacuum cleaner, which at least have a large surface area to trap the dirt.The HEPA filter is also difficult to clean. They claim you can ""tap"" it, but in reality I find myself having to bang it against a hard surface. It is the only way to make dirt come off. Banging it also causes dust to fly all over the place. Inhaling the fine dust trapped by HEPA could be fatal.In my case, trying to vacuum a 200 sq ft. carpeted room usually takes me 1 hour because I have to clean it every 20 seconds of use; otherwise the motor would overheat. The dust bin would still be nearly empty. It has been that way since the very first time I used it",1

I bought these a couple months ago. they are a very good looking set of bottle stoppers but it has only been a couple months with minimal use and I have already noticed major problems.  The first issue is that they do not fit italian bottles of wine, the bottle stoppers will not even go in with force so if you drink mostly or all italian wine you will have no use for these.  The second issue is that of bottles that they do fight it is not a tight fit.  If you put it in the bottle and not move the bottle at all it will not drip but if you rock it back and forth once even lightly a little wine will drip out.  The third issue is with the plating, they seem to be chrome plated but the chrome plating starts to come off after one use.  I used it for a week, when I took it out of the bottle I relized it was either rusted or small amounts of the plating came off, I hand washed it and realized it was permanent.

The rake gets stuck with even very little waste in the box and you have to help it along with either your hand or your foot.  The rake doesn't reach the bottom of the box and I usually have 3/4 of an inch of dried clumped litter stuck to the bottom that I have to scrape out.  I cleaned the box completely out this morning, emptied, cleaned inside and out, dried thoroughly and put all fresh litter in and the rake got stuck with nothing to move. (No, the box isn't overfull of litter either).  After doing research, as soon as this dies (and I suspect it will be very very soon) I'm going to spend the $$ on the Litter Robot.  My fully automatic Litter Mate isn't bad but the rake does require regular cleaning and after a year, it's starting to show it's age and not run as well.

I have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere I move it. The main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace.

The internal grinder works well. Its loud so using it early in the am for that first pot is not feasible unless you want to use it a an alarm clock.  The grinder always ends up damp so you  constantly need to dry it off. It would have been a better system if they made the grinder insert optional for brewing coffee. If you try to leave the grinder out of the system it beeps at you and won't do anything. I assume it is safety feature but it is annoying to clean a damp grinder when you don't use it. The best feature is the carafe. You put the top on and that's it. You pour a cup without having to adjust the top and end up spilling hot coffee on you or the counter. It is a little cumbersome getting the last cup out of carafe but  a minor complaint. If it dies again I will get it replaced under warranty if the warranty is done I will not get the exact replacement.

When I called customer service, they explained that the only time the reset light will come on is if there's no water left in the resevoir or if there is a mineral build up on the heating element.  I explained that I had just bought the system less than an hour ago so there's no chance that there is a build up of any kind and that the tank is full.

So, instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece, I will return this to the store as defective and get the money back.

1383,Don't bother with this model. Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower.I also couldn't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. Even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise. Not just me but my husband too so it's not a case of super human hearing on my part :-)Yes the timer option is very nice. This was actually why I purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking. But what good is the timer function if the microphone can't pick up the barking?So read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units. Unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else.,1

On top of that, whenever you have to go back a stage, you have to buy a new system, due to the fact that you have to cut out the bottom as they progress in stages.

I've gone through a half/loaf of bread testing it and I am not happy. I appreciate the reviews on Amazon and checked here to see the comments on this product.

There's only two grill height settings and you cant easily change heights when the grill is hot and cooking (the grill surface itself flips over to cause the height change). There is a door provided to stoke the coals that appears to be a needless feature. The hibachi's feet are not insulated and can get pretty hot, so beware of placement on high-value surfaces. The draft door is heavy and easily separates from the body. The heavy door already tagged me once on the foot as I was emptying the BBQ of ash. Really?, I'd give it a 5 out of 10 for usefullness as compared to other hibachis that I've used in the past.

I have never had this happen with any other Hoover electric broom, so I called Hoover and they said that this model is only meant to be used 20 MINUTES PER WEEK and only for quick pickups. No where does their literature say this on the box or in the manual inside the box. This product is a completely useless item if you want to use it on a daily basis. I purchased it for bare floors, not carpet, yet it has a rolling brush for carpet use.

The sound level, however, is more like a coffee grinder than a 'silent' fountain. We checked all the applicable trouble-shooting tips, such as making sure the pump was properly secured to the bottom on its suction cups, and also making sure there was sufficient water in the system for the pump to function properly. Still, quite loud. The cat reacted to it like it was a killer robot from space. Returned it and got the Drinkwell, which also has some pump noise, but it is well masked by the sound of the splashing water, which seems to appeal to the kitty, rather than repelling her.",1

1406,"NOT ""Scientific"" -- NOT a Positive Training Tool. Before you buy into the hype and purchase an item you'll eventually discard (if you love your dog, that is) you should know that dogs hate this device. It feels totally unnatural to them. Its so-called ""scientific"" design is based on the way a supposed alpha wolf enforces his authority by aggressively gripping a subordinate around the muzzle with his teeth. (Nice, huh?) Since we now know that the alpha theory is false, the rationale behind this torture device for dogs is equally bogus. (Wild wolf packs do not form dominance hierarchies or spend time trying to show each other who's boss by grabbing each other around the snout; such behaviors are only produced when wolves are forced to form unnatural packs while living in captivity.) A device that mimics a totally unnatural act of aggression cannot be considered positive.As a dog trainer, and just as a human being who loves dogs and hates to see them being mistreated, I cannot stress strongly enough that this device should not be used on any dog, ever.So what do you do to keep your dog from pulling? Dogs don't really pull on the leash so much as they get pulled on by things in the environment that stimulate and attract their instincts. So the trick to training a dog NOT to pull is to play games that will make YOU more interesting and more appealing to his instincts than the things in the environment are.",1

1409,"It would have been so easy for them to do much better!. This cooker makes wonderful rice.  I don't find it especially slow--slightly slower than cooking on the stove, but not much.  The rice has great texture and flavour.  The product is not particularly difficult to clean.  An excellent nonstick pot means you get the rice skin in your food rather than having it stick to the pot, but in some circles the skin is a delicacy.  Basically, not bad.But the electronics are pathetic.  Given how easily Sanyo could have done better, I'm harsh in my criticism:First: there is no audible notice when your rice is done.  It cooks for a while and then it stops.  It only counts down the last ten minutes (it does not know initially how long the rice will take because, presumably, more rice takes longer and it has to sense how much rice there is (which it does quite well)).  But this means that you can't even reliably set a kitchen timer!  Not that you should have to--there's quite a sophisticated computer in there, and it would add no complexity and little hardware to make it beep!  But no, you just have to watch the unit.Second: there is a nice ""steam"" feature, but it is not possible to use that with a timer.  The manual helpfully advises that you time steaming by hand, which is difficult because while the machine knows when the water starts to boil, it doesn't tell you!  You have to watch or listen for steam.  At least the ""slow cook"" feature lets you time things (in increments of a half hour; think all-day stew).Third, I'm partial to 24-hour clocks, but I'm used to 12-hour clocks.  This unit has neither: it mostly follows 12-hour conventions, but noon is 0:00, not 12:00.  This is more logical (a numbering system that goes from 0 to 12- rather than from 1 to 13- as is the convention) but I've done double-takes a few times because 0:00 is midnight in the 24-hour world.  Why Sanyo thought it a good idea to use _neither_ of the standard clock formats, but rather invent their own, is a mystery.Fourth (only for the somewhat absent-minded): the unit does not shut off when you open the lid.  When your rice is cooked the unit enters ""keep warm"" mode, which is great, but even when the lid is opened and the bowl removed the unit stays in that mode until I start to wonder why my kitchen feels warm.  The ""keep warm"" light is probably more obvious if you're not as tall as I am, and I suppose some people will serve some rice, close the unit, eat, go back for more rice...  at least an audible warning that the unit is still on upon lid open/close would be nice.Fifth: The control panel resets to its default (""white rice"") after each use.  There's a battery backup for the clock and I leave mine plugged in anyway, so the machine could easily remember the last thing you did (I almost always cook brown rice), but it doesn't.Sixth: of course a holster for the provided spatula wouldn't be a bad idea, but that's minor.In summary: it makes very good rice, but Sanyo cut many stupidly trivial corners",1

The written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old Vornado models that are the best electric heaters I've ever had.  The VH2 has major flaws.  It's single fan speed is way too fast, causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater.  The fan cannot be slowed down.  The thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals; thereby wasting energy I believe.  Finally, the thermostat is set so that when at the highest (hottest) setting it doesn't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees F.I've had the heater &lt;1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as I have an alternative brand in my home",1

This thing screams like a banshee! It is indeed light, and reasonably powerful, but it literally hurts my ears to use it in small rooms. It does not roar, it emits a relatively high pitched scream. I have had big, small, and medium size vacuums, and this thing easily is louder than all of them. I haev a 2 1/2 horsepower Shop Vac which is much quieter than this vacuum.2. Wheels barely extend below the bottom of the vacuum, so it requires a bit of effort to roll over anything but very short carpet. Wheeling from room to room, say over hardwood while tipping the vacuum back, also cannot really be done.3. The filter is hard to clean, as it has a flange that extends down over maybe 1/3 of one side.

Well, I was shocked to discover that  inside the faucet mount and on both water mouths there was red stuff growing.I called Brita and was told that it is not the product, SINCE IT IS NOT EVEN DESIGNED TO FILTER OUT BACTERIA, it must be the water. Long story short: Brita still pushes it product on people who doesn't know better.This product is poorly designed and drains bad, therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it. Since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one.IF you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out. Neither did I, you have to be a chemist to understand the lingo.Stay away since this product may be harmfull to your health by its poor quality.",1
1440,"Piece of Junk. I purchased this when it first came out on the market thought it would be great for just one cup of coffee in the morning. Purchased the cappicino pods from the home cafe website and wanted to try those, they didnt fit. The top of the machine after you put in the pod wouldnt shut. Called customer service and was told yes they knew there was a problem and there engineers were working on it, took my name and number and said they would get back to me when they had it fixed.  That's been over a year ago.  My question, why sell the pods online or even the coffeemaker if they knew there was a problem???  Now all my coffeemaker does is leak all over the place.  This is going into the trash today, dont waste your money on this coffeemaker, spend a little more and get something you know will work",1

1443,"Didn't work for me, but your mileage may vary. I bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor's mutt.  The offending dog is often left on the neighbor's porch, where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by.Before ordering, I had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect.  In my case, the neighbor's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine.  Unfortunately, this was not ""too close for comfort"" as far as the dog was concerned.Having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices, I was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working.  Alas, it did not.  Some dogs just don't hear them.  In my case, it was probably due at least in part to the distance.My suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target.  If it doesn't work, go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what I did).  By the way, you don't need an RA (AKA RMA) number to return the device.  Just send it to the company along with your receipt, and a note saying that you would like a refund (not an exchange).(...)  I sympathize with anyone having this problem, and wish you all the best of luck.  No one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason, and the argument that ""dogs bark"" simply does not hold any water",1

1445,"bsrk control collar for small dogs. We bought the PetSafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much.  It is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 Maltese.  This particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won't work.  Unfortunately, because it's rigid, it slides up a dog's neck very easily.  I have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can't slide.  Even when I can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides, it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position.  A shrug, a shake, or simply walking a few steps is all it takes.  This is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs, is not going to work.  It should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight, it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member, this is NOT a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems.  The dog now has another negative association to the person.  Consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying.F. Quall",1

1453,"Okay for occasion home use, hard to clean, unsanitary. My wife and I do a lot of volunteering catering for the local elementary school.  We also direct our school PTA's hospitality services.  That requires large amounts of food prep on a monthly basis for all the events requiring food.This Rival slicer was relatively cheap and did a good first job, making quick work on items that need to be sliced thin.  It's good for the less skilled cooks out there who aren't skilled with a knife, as well as for even good chefs that need to do large volume tasks with common items like luncheon meat, ham, or other cold cuts.But it's certainly no commercial Hobart slicer, and it won't produce the same quality of results.  The blade is quickly dulled if attempting to slice a semi-frozen roast to produce thin raw beef for say, Philly Cheese Steak or for Vietnamese Noodles.  Also, the design catches meat underneath which festers unless you disassemble the entire under carriage and remove the gunk underneath and disenfect.I debated whether to give this product 2 or 3 stars, and while it does come in handy for occasional home use, I'm experienced with a knife and have decent knives and professional sharpening equipment.  In the time it takes to break this out and slice and do the clean up, I can out-produce this by hand about 2:1.  But that still would warrant 3 stars in my book, but I had to lower the rating to 1-star because of the residue and trapped meat and sinews that the undercarriage causes.  I don't know who designed it, but being a very highly trained in mechanical engineering, this seems like classic idiotic American slap-together design and get it out in the low-end marketplace to stupid comsumers who don't know any better.  Rival is basically asking for a lawsuit, not because people will cut themselves in this case, but because the undercarriage traps stuff and to remove it, you really have to remove components that aren't user serviceable and even then, it's still hard to clean.  Ever since the first use, I've diligently disassembled the under carriage, exposing some electrical wiring, and cleaned out the residue left by the slicing process.And yes, the gears are plastic as another reviewer noticed.  If you use your slicer often, the blade dulls quickly, and the motor will work harder and this will damage the gears sooner.What happens if you're less mechanically inclined and don't clean the slicer like I do?  Well, we had only one ant problem last summer in the house and it was because they found the mostly cleaned slicer boxed and placed on a rack, then found the residue and proceeded to invite a million sister ants to come in and feast on it.  Try as we might to disassemble and clean it, more residue kept coming out and the ants would not relent and kept attacking the slicer.  I ended up doing a nearly full disassembly and submersive cleaning of the slicer components (except for motor) and to repackage the slicer in knew plastic with Windex spray on the exterior of the box to neutralize the formic acid of the ants.As a scientist, engineer and volunteer cook, I'd recommend that people stay away from this product, unless they like to disassemble the whole thing and then spend an hour wiping and disenfecting the thing after each use.",1

My experience was the same as another reviewer of the Lentek PC16 who noted that the unit only works on the ""Audible"" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ""Ultrasonic"" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc.This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality.

1483,"Filters Look New Unit Says Replace Them. I purchased a Brita after being a devout pitcher system user for years. I'd had a faucet system from Pur a few years back and it leaked. I was hesitant to go the faucet route again. I figured I'd pay extra for this most expensive Brita model, assuming mechanical integrity.Here's my overview:The installation (to the sink) was easy. The unit has not leaked at all. This is great.The filter installation is easy. The battery installation was also easy.I have owned the system for 4 months and replaced 2 filters. The Aquaview display in BJs shows a clearly worn filter needing replacement. This worn filter is shown through the Aquaview window. My own filters look as clean as the day I installed them at the point when the unit indicates yellow and red LED lights. This , by Brita's own definition, is when you replace your filter.The cost of these filters is $25 a whack. I would not mind this price if I felt the filter's proverbial time was up. I'm feeling that I'm replacing good filters. I taste test the water each day. The tap water defintely tastes worse than the Brita water. Noticeable. This gives me confidence the unit is working. The Aquaview feature is supposed to be away to say--Hey look my filter is really dirty, it's capturing the contaminants I'd drink. My town's water is dirty. If you leave sheets wet in the washer, you will get a brown tinge.Why are my filters clean in the Brita unit after two months. The LED says change the filter (RED Light). The aquaview shows me a clean filter to the naked eye. The price of use for these filters is $150 per year, with this red light going off every two months like a clock alarm. Brita is there a chance that the filter is still good, even with your LED light on? Can you let consumers in on this? I realize many contaminants may not make your filter elements dirty, but then why make something called an Aquaview filter, if the view shows  a clean filter and I'm throwing away a clean filter.So fellow consumers, beware! The proof is not in the pudding. Taste alone does not insure that harmful contaminants are not reaching me---this means the system may not be working even on week one. The LED light system, at least in my household, does not correlate even slightly with the naked eye  Aquaview condition. My filters look like they could go another month or two without dirtying. This may be testimony to a really good filter. The taste test does not correlate with the Red Light. The water, even with a replace indicator, and a clean view indicator, still tastes better than tap and equivalent to the filter being a day or two old. I would say my filter is still good and Brita has me over replacing good filters but we're dealing with the world of microbial contaminants---who are they to go liberal on filter conservation. On the other hand it's a big hit to consumers and environment to be throwing these units away good.So.......beware on this machine. You will probably, even with a dirty view, find yourself replacing filters sooner than the manufacturer describes. You may find yourself like me and  another reviewer on this site, with LED lights going off and filters not looking dirty. I am curious about the New Jersey person who claims they have not changed it yet, seemed like about 6 months. This is disconcerting because the LED light is a timer or volume control and would go off regardless of your Aquaview filters visual condition. 6 months on a filter seems too long though and I'd conjecture you're getting some bad stuff in your tap.Brita please provide much greater detail on your website (which doesn't work tonight for registration or support email.Regards",1

This filter was a nightmare to set up, and it is probably my fault.See, I got ths filter for the 2 aquatic turtles that I have.Anyone who has turtles knows that one does not want to have the entire tank filled as though they were keeing fish. Turtles need to be able to get out.I started looking at canister filters ecause of a blog entry on the fluval canister filter. I researched and researched looking for more informatio on alternate filters, after all the xP2 was less expensive an for most posts, it was a toss on who had the better product. so I got it.4 hours later dealing with priming I finally have a system that isnt working quite right but at least its doing something. Modifications were done using the excess hosing on the intake to conince the pump motor that there is more pressure.So I guess there is a moral to this story, this is not the filter you are looking for if you have any need to have the tank less than all the way full. and if you make it work like I did (heck spending 130 on the set up-- it does not come with addional media like ceramics like the fluval does-- you better believe i made it work!) it is not silent. you hear all sorts of air popping noises, but this is the quietet i've gotten it so i'm quitting whle im ahead.happy tank keeping",1

This one began to do the same after being used only two or three times and died completely on the fourth clean up. The container was never really full so it was not a case of overload on either unit...at least not user overload. My best guess as to what is wrong with this product is that they put some great filters on a cheap motor. The motor isn't strong enough to pull the dirt through the filter and quickly burns out.

Unfortunately, the Amazon shipping department seems to have difficulty packing delicate items: The first shipment included a couple of heavy books which shifted during mailing and broke the glasses. The replacement box had the glasses jammed against one corner with air packing around three sides. Those arrived broken, also. Guess we'll purchase the glasses at a wine shop! Love Amazon and this is the first time we've had a shipping problem with you!",1

1491,"Totally Worthless. I bought this vac to replace an older Dirt Devil stick vac that I had for about ten years.  I really liked the old one and thought I was getting a more powerful version of the it. The new one is more powerful alright, but all the power is situated in one tiny section of the floor brush.  If you don't aim that section right onto what you are trying to pick up - forget it!I agree with some of the other reviewers on the noise level.  It's so noisy I feel I should be wearing ear plugs.  Also, I can't figure out what's with all the air that blows around while you're trying to focus on your one little area.  I think that's where all the power goes.  Dust, debris and hair blow all over the room.I'm going this weekend to buy a new stick vacuum that works.  Maybe I can sell this one in a garage sale.My advice to others is DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!  I only rated it with one star because I had no other option",1
1492,"Extremely stupid control logic. This heater works reasonably well, it's not too noisy on the LOW setting, but it's electronic control is designed extremely bad. First of all it has three operational modes: LOW, HIGH and AUTO. Low uses half of its heating power and runs the fan on a slower and quieter speed. High - uses full power and is the noisiest. Thermostat setting/operation is not available nether under low nor under high mode.On Auto mode you can set the desired temperature and the heater will do a reasonably good job of maintaining the set temperature, but - when it's on Auto mode the heater runs on it's full power and becomes noisy.There is no way to make use of the thermostat with the low heating power.I think that most people would actually want to use Auto mode with the low power, especially if they use the heater in a bedroom, but some genius at DeLonghi decided to save a few cents by not providing this option.The heater also 'forgets' your last Auto temperature setting after you switch it off and defaults to 75, so every time you switch it on again you have to adjust temperature - pretty annoying IMO. In spite of the fact that I got it pretty cheap (under 40), it's going back.",1

1498,"Great pottery, ruined expectations by Macy's. We love Fiesta Ware pottery.  This is a quality product made of tough clay with well matched durable glaze. Because of this and its famous assortment of sumptious colors, I will buy it every time.  However, when buying this product from Macy's I found the following to be true:1.) Items or colors listed as in stock and shipping (the pizza plate for example)get listed as backordered after you purchase and languish for months before the order is inexplicably canceled.2.) Items that are seconds quality being sold as first quality. On average, 10% of our orders included slay slubs, glaze missing in spots and other imperfections.3.) Range of products severely limited4.) Color choice from available range severly limited.So, in short, buy Fiesta Ware. A quality product, made in the United States, of charming beauty--but reconsider Macy's as your Amazon supplier",1

The temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees....",1

Some of the reviews said it was poorly made but I wasn't looking for a high quality product just something functional that would last a year or so. It lasted 3 weeks and then just stopped working.  Initially when we wound it it would keep going even if no pressure on it so you had to rewind every time you used it. Then it just stopped. Of course by then the 30 days to return had passed.

As with every other sheet set I have purchased for the deep mattress, the fitted sheet does fit OK. However, if one wants to tuck in the flat sheet on one side of the mattress, there is hardly any sheet left to cover the bed! I guess that deep mattress sheet sets will always be ""short-sided"" on the flat sheet until manufacturers begin making an oversize flat sheet, too. I am, none the less, disappointed",1

Man I must be in heaven. Not only that but it breaks easily, does this thing have no limit? So I bought this great video center around a year ago.... And what happens it breaks. I had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap. It looks like you're in a baby kids room. Similar to those play centers in day cares or McDonalds. Man that is lame.... I just love having children decor in my house, and it has to be $80. If I were you.... I would just let my systems, TV, and CDs sit in some tubberware. Believe me it would be 50X safer!",1
1505,"The Ford Pinto of coffee makers... When you first get the BrewStation it works great.  It's really convenient.  I bought one for my Mom last Christmas (2005) and she loved it.  One day I walked into the kitchen and noticed coffee all over the counter around the BrewStation.  I whiped it up and didn't give it another thought.  But the next day I went back and there was coffee all over the counter again.  It was then I noticed that the spout had developed a leak.  My Mom said she hadn't a clue what was wrong with it, so we cleaned it and sit it on the dining room table for about 2 months unused.  Yesterday, I went back to it and figured it was probably the gasket around the spout.  I found the replacement gasket that came with it and replaced it.  I then cleaned it off and placed it back on the counter and filled it with water.  I ran it with just plain water to see if it would leak and at first it didn't.  Then after it got up to about 6 cups it began dripping again.  Bummer...So I left it sitting there and put a paper towl under it and when I went back about 20 minutes later the paper towel was soaked.The bottom line is the BrewStation my be convenient and have great features, but you would be better buying a $10 traditional coffee maker at your local Dollar Store.",1

It does not have a glass thermal lining (I should have known to look for that feature before I purchased this product.)After a half hour in the server, the coffee is lukewarm and I have to reheat it in the microwave.Secondly, the screw-on top has some features that seem to serve no purpose - a button on top that I assume is intended to release the vacuum so the coffee can be poured out.  It doesn't work, you have to loosen the lid itself. Also, the lid comes apart into several pieces for cleaning I guess.  But it collects coffee inside the hollow lid and then that coffee dribbles all over the place.",1

In order to open a can you have to tilt the can just right under the ""locater post"" and even then the one I have opens a can maybe only 1 out of 20 tries.  Maybe I got a lemon, but in any event, its not even worth returning it after considering shipping, etc.  I'll just buy another brand and eat this one.  Do yourself a favor - pass on this product",1

Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly",1

I have four area carpets, two 8x10s and two 3x5s. The apartment collects its fair share of dust, but since it's just me, there is minimal traffic. My Swiffer electric broom that I got at the grocery store does a marvelous job of keeping everything clean and tidy. I've even used the Swiffer on the carpets, but because it doesn't slide easily over the carpets (I have to remove the dust cloth and essentially get down on the carpet on my hands and knees to manually run it over the carpet surface), I decided to buy a separate stick vacuum that could do a better job. Well, I wish I had heeded the negative reviews on this product. It is very loud indeed, louder than my old Bissell traditional carpet vacuum which long ago became so clogged that it is no longer functional. The noise really is painful to the ears. It blows dust and dirt away rather than sucking it up. You do have to vacuum over and over on the same spot to get it to pick anything up. Same thing on my hardwoods, linoleum and tile - it just blows everything around. Apart from the noise, this seems like an easily fixed design flaw. Guess I will be sticking with the Swiffer for now",1

When I look at some of the positive reviews of this product, I wonder what these people were comparing these towels against.  Martex makes a VERY large cross-section of towels found in most all stores under a multitude of brand names.  This particular line seems to be a low-end one and one that uses Supima cotton fibers that are not as fine as good Egyptian cotton ones. The cotton loops on this towel are small, not nearly as fine as good Egyptian cotton and the towel itself doesn't have a good heft/fluffiness to it (seems thin and for lack of a better word, ""Wal-Marty"".  If you want a great quality product for the same price, search for the ""Famous Maker Washcloth 2-Pack"" made by GRAND PATRICIAN, right here on Amazon.  I ordered both brands at the same time and the difference between the two is like night and day. Make sure that the Grand Patrician ones mention ""100% Egyptian fine extra-long staple cotton"" in the description. That is your assurance that you are getting the finer line product, not yet another low-end line product such as this Martex Altier.  This is important since the actual brand/contents of the ""Famous Maker"" towel products can change with time.  Also, the list price on the Grand Patrician is noted as being lower than that for this Martex product but don't let that fool you. I still gave the Martex 2-stars since it is not a bad value in and by itself.  But it is an atrocious choice if you also have the option of the Egyptian cotton Grand Patrician ones from Amazon at the same price",1

1561,"Batteries and DC Adapter don't mix!  Clip destroys books. The design for using the DC adapter with this little light is extremely poor.  It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter.  But, it must not have been very big.  I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case.  These were brand new batteries.  There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them.  This is bad.  Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.Then, after I cleaned it all up, it worked for about a week w/o the batteries installed.  Then the LEDs started flickering.  The next day, it was dead.  To see if it had to do with the battery leak, I took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head.  But something on the little circuit board must have blown.The other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book.  I found this a problem with soft cover books, at least.  Putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better.I had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions.  I've gone through many Zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out.  This one is beyond my ability and I'm done giving Zelco my money.  They are a nice idea, but have no durability.  If they were cheaper, it might not be such a big deal, but for their price I would like to see them be far more durable",1

I keep the sponge moist and it still sits in the small area where the litter box is; for the most part, I don't notice any smells, but I'm not sure if that is due to the Smellkiller or because I use A&H Baking Soda Kitty Litter, a 2nd litter with crystals, AND the A&H litter box deodorizer powder.I suppose it works ok, but I wouldn't buy another one, and I don't think it works the miracles claimed in other reviews. Also, mine didn't stay on the wall either...came crashing down only 1 day after I put it up. Now it just sits on top of the litter box",1

Amazon replaced it with another one that still did not work, the cap kept popping off when I pressed meat into the tube. I returned that one too and gave up after that. If you can afford to pay $40, then go get yourself a real jerky gun.Pros: Cheap, cleans easily. Comes with a variety of spice packets in the box.Cons: Cheap, flaky mechanism, capacity is only 1/2 pound, must refill often (two fills per dehydrator tray)Advise, if you use the cure that comes in the package, use only 3/4 of the quantity, the prepackaged amounts tend to make the meat too salt",1

It cooked fairly evenly, offered convection speed, and looked attractive in chrome.Unfortunately--like many reviewers on Rival's sister unit (the TO600)--we started experiencing problems with the control knobs getting stuck. In our case it was the all important timer knob which would freeze while COOKING AND COUNTING DOWN. The unit is fairly quiet and if you aren't paying close attention (and who is during the morning rush?) then suddenly your 4-minute bagel has been broiling for 15-minutes and is nearly on fire! Given the other reviews on Rival countertop ovens this is obviously not a problem isolated to just our unit.Rival did make a digital touchpad version of this oven but it has been discontinued. And even if it were available--a call to Rival revealed that they were only willing to replace our unit with the exact same model. No thanks! Taking the recommendation of a major consumer magazine, we've purchased a Cuisinart TOB-175 with DIGITAL timer and would highly recommend it",1

The water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses.I'm sending both units back and buying another brand.If they had worked properly, I'm not sure I would have like them even then.  The design of this unit is ""odd"".  I've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird.  If you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew, the grounds and steam explode all over.  I also suspect that the thermostat is broken.  It allows the water to boil--which does not make tasty coffee.Overall, I hate this unit.  I'm going back to shopping",1

Now, 10 years later, I can tell you that all the pans I barely used, are still fine, look good. The pans I used daily (the fry pans) are absolute messes. I cook with egg whites a lot, so I think that having something so hard to get off really had taken a toll on the pans.At $60 (the current price) I would consider how much you use cookware. I must replace my frypan now and have a ""non-coordinated"" set. Do your research on non-stick finishes before making the investment.In all fairness, my favorite pot is the stockpot and I use it many times per week for stews, spaghetti, manwhiches, and it still looks great",1
1587,"Flawed design. I have watched Emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter.  I just dismissed it as part of Emeril's shtick until I bought this machine for myself.  The first time I tried to use it with any liquid ingredients (making mayonnaise), it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl.  The top is just flawed in its design, as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl.  I suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that KA did, much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews (e. g. Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated).In any case, this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry (they blow through the badly designed joint as well) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter, the outside of the bowl, the bottom of the machine, and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do.  I will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the Cuisinart I have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard.",1

After much research I invested in the Tranquil Moments Sound Therapy System.  Although I loved it and the quality of the sound, I would not recommend it.  The light is very bright, so I always had to keep it covered with a washcloth.  About once a week or so, it turned itself off in the middle of the night (and no, I hadn't selected the sleep timer).  Recently, it died for good.  I'd only had it for 10 months.  Too late for me, I then found a couple of reviews on other sites that mentioned the same problem of the unit turning itself off",1

1600,"OK for miscellaneous knives, not for the GOOD stuff!. I also have to echo the comments of other reviewers when saying if you have inexpensive, common cutlery this sharpener will work OK.  If you have Chef's Quality cutlery don't bring it near this machine.  It leaves a rough edge no matter which stone you use and simply isn't meant for good quality knives.  If you paid a couple of hundred dollars or more for your set of kitchen knives, get them professionally sharpened.  If you have run-of-the-mill cutlery this machine will do OK",1
1601,"Okay, but not great. I tested this out as soon as I got it and was not thrilled with the results.  The steamer barely took the wrinkles out of a satin shirt after I used almost the entire container of water.  The product might work better on cotton or a sturdier fabric.  In a pinch, if you have the time to go over the garment numerous times this item is for you.  From what I have read this is one of the best of the travel garment steamers.  Maybe my expectation were a little to high.Pros-Easy to use-price (same product at Sharper Image for lots more)Cons-Helped but didn't get all the wrinkles out",1

It was working fine initially until I started using my Capresso beans, which were delivered to me just last week (made use of the Amazon rebate offer).  The machine seems stuck and there is no longer a clear stream of brewed coffee.  Instead, the coffee came out in droplets literally and the amount also dwindled.  The machine kept requesting that its tap be turned on.  I've stopped using it altogether and have emailed the Capresso customer service for assistance yesterday.  There's no point calling the toll-free number since I'm never home during office hours to go through the process.  This should not happen since the beans ought to be compatible in the first instance.Other than that, I must say the machine is simple to use and very convenient.

They said they would take it for repairs, but $25 for shipping across country is unacceptable. Avoid this unit",1

Long story short: Brita still pushes it product on people who doesn't know better.This product is poorly designed and drains bad, therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it. Since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one.IF you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out.

We ordered a set of Turquoise Candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with &quot;straight candle&quot; results.  Even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product.  Specifically, the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles.  We were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better.  We are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations.  Fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform, a kind of &quot;softer&quot; look in the color application around the rims on plates, for example, and the piece will still look beautiful.  We don't want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our Fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces",1

1614,"If you want excellent, rich cappucino, do NOT get this. I'm an espresso/cappucino only drinker, and have owned a variety of machines over the past 20 years. I've had this one for less than a week and it's going back to the store for refund. After having read all of the reviews, here is exactly what is correct and what to expect (p.s. if you're not a cappucino conniseur, please don't bother writing a review):Pros:1 - built like an absolute tank. Beautiful style and construction (this does not mean excellent engineering... just means not 'flimsy'). The thing weighs like 40 pounds). 100% durable.2 - short wait time for water to get hot. Like this really matters compared to a boiler-type machine (this is thermoblock). A boiler takes what, 7 minutes and this one takes 4? Are you that much in a rush for a cup? Takes 20 minutes at Starbucks.Cons:1 - I have a $1,100 Pavoni, the best boiler/manual pump machines in the world. You can't come close with the Breville. At best with fine ground espresso I can get slightly rich coffee while the machine pumps for 5 minutes.2 - The filters stink. The double-wall on them is only there because the machine does not produce enough pressure/temperature. The filters leave a soupy mess and not a dry puck (a puck is indicative of a boiler system). Makes you want to drill holes in the bottom of the filters (as is, there's only a single pinhole that gets clogged).3 - What steam? When you first switch to steam mode, it spits out a nice 2-3 second stream of water. And whatever you call the air pithing out you can put your hand up to for a bit without scalding. You're better off making foam using your lungs and a straw, then nuking it in a microwave. It hardly produces any foam.4 - The hot plate on top is not a hot plate. It's a luke-warm plate. My heating pad for my back is warmer.Overall, if you're an inexperieced cappucino maker who thinks Dunkin' Donuts hung the moon, get this machine. Otherwise it will end up being returned or being a workshop anvil",1

It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.I had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries.

A few inches from the nozzle, I can hold my hand in the steam.  Directly under the nozzle, I cannot, but I was under the assumption that the steam was significantly more powerful that this.Now that I am resigned to the fact that I have to keep this unit, I tried it on my shower, and it is not all that impressive there either.

The lid is slightly too large and if used on a non-stick pan will damage the non-stick surface since it sits on that instead of the lip of the pan.  So, I have returned it.

1622,Filter Coffe is Good Espresso is not so. I have previously owned a separate Krups Espresso machine and it made great espresso. This one doesn't. The problem is the amount of coffee you have to put in to make an espresso they say 2-4 cups but if you make two you cant compact the coffee unless your making for four so no crema ever :(.

Specifically, this toaster is Made in China. So don't think because it has the DeLonghi name it is actually made in Italy or the EU. It's *designed* in Italy is all. Chinese manufacturing is often a good deal for the manufacturer and a bad deal for the customer. I would say that this is one of those cases.The toaster is suprisingly light as others have mentioned. The fit of the parts where the sides meet the center part of the assembly is not tight - one of the first things I noticed was  a gap of varying width on both sides. It's a small gap don't get me wrong, but with the name and the price I was very disappointed. The manufacturing further showed its sub-standard quality when after a few months it stopped working after I cleaned out the crumb tray. I was careful not to get it wet or in any way abuse the unit, but it simply wouldn't toast any more. I ended up going out to get a less expensive product with a similar appearance - so far so good.It will be a long time before I buy anything from DeLonghi again..",1
1624,"Deceptive Picture. Like other customers, I too thought I was getting a crate, and not a divider.  The image for this product is extremely deceptive, as it shows a crate with no divider.  I feel that the picture should be removed, so the product can be represented accurately",1

Although microfiber mops are relatively new, major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs. In order to standout from all the competition, five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops. Google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews. Fortunately the ""reviews"" were fabricated about a month ago so, hopefully, not too many customers have been deceived. My experience has been that most reviewers give, helpful honest reviews.",1

Two weeks later, I did not have a utensil holder and I had received no further communication from the company.  I plan to return the item and dispute the charge on my credit card.

Got this because of cat litter issue on a carpet, don't want to lug around the vacuum, thought this was the answer.Picks up a little, but it is so amazingly noisy, which if i'm gonna be that loud, might as well get a real vacuum cleaner.I am guessing that Bissell has sold out along with alot of the old standard companies in America and moved to Mexico, and this would explain why the products are sub par, i mean you can't take a customer service issue if you don't know the language, so Bissell , i am here to help you out today!

1635,"Very small for a pair of kitchen scissors!. The description claims that these scissors are good for use in the kitchen but I think that needs some clarification.  The cutting edge of the blades is only about an inch and a half long!  The ""Torque engineering"" that is referred to can surely only mean that the handles are longer than the blades and so providing a gain due to leverage - other than that there is nothing really different compared to 'regular' scissors.  When the description refers to chicken bones does it really mean just chicken ribs and cartlidge? The pivot is a simple rivet - pretty basic (and cheap) for a relatively expensive pair of scissors.  Such a simple rivet also means that you can't take the blades apart.  The scissors do work OK as regular scissors i.e. for cutting paper, plastic packaging etc. but no more so than any other reasonably well made, and possibly less expensive, design",1

The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it.  The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty.  so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on.  So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great.  Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do",1

1646,"Not Stainless or Straight-Through. I bought this grinder for my wife who likes extra fine grind and she was tired of holding the button on our current burr grinder and wanted an automatic shutoff. The straight-through sounded good as our current Salton grinder would accumulate grinds on the side shoot and had to be cleaned regularly. Stainless sounded even better.When I received the grinder I looked at the parts and it looked like any other grinder. The stainless part is the BACK COVER and has nothing to do with performance. Then I pulled out the grind container and found that not only is it not straight through but has an extra bent tube that routes the grinds out the side of the grinder and down into the the container. If the direct side outlet clogs, this will clog even more.I never even tried it, but sent it back. Total misrepresentation by Capresso",1

From Day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time I was vacuuming on hardwood. If I accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb, the belt broke. I took to buying lots of extra belts whenever I went to the store. The other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason. I promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute I turned the vacuum on. I say: NO MORE. I am now determined to buy the best vacuum EVER. I don't care how much it costs!! The only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch; and it is pretty powerful. But that's it. Changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers, I frequently run over the cord. Something just wasn't designed right there... You've been warned",1

The comfortable handle made holding the slicer a dream, but the dream ended quickly.  The wire broke halfway through the first slice!  Unlike my old slicer, this one does not have a screw on the side to re-attach the existing wire, adjust the tension or replace a broken wire.   Oxo's web site says they guarantee satisfaction, so I am going to see if I can actually get it replaced without paying more in shipping than I saved by buying this slicer rather than the fancier one",1

The trouble is that when you try to adjust to say, 70-85 degrees the sensitivity of the thermostat becomes extreme and you can never get it right. It'll either stay on all the time or never come on until you get to around 65F.  It also smells rather nasty",1

It was also very heavy to maneuver around. The solution reservoir was too small and had to be refilled often. Cleaning the tanks takes a very long time. The attachments are useless since hose is not long enough the machine needs to be repositioned frequently to be near the area you want to clean. There was also leaking water on the floor every time after turning the vacuum off. Finally, it saved me no time at all. It took longer to do the floor with this vacuum than it would have if I used a broom and mop",1

I tried it on two different shapes of bottles, but to no avail.  The problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper doesn't slide when it's on the bottle.  When off the bottle, the mechanism works fine.  It appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general.  At least that was my experience.  I found a good $3.00 stopper at Sur la Table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle.  It doesn't have the fancy pour spout, but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne",1

One thing we immediately noticed was that when we attached it to our faucet, the water stream was no longer a smooth stream into the sink like it used to be... now it was a full-on spray.  It's a real inconvenience to try to run water over a spoon or into a glass for washing when you need pressure and your stream is spraying all over your hands and sink.  I haven't read any other reviews where anyone else has had this problem, so we're going to take this model back and exchange it for an upgraded model.

1663,"Nesco roaster oven. Well, after having this for almost a year, I honestly am sorry I bought it because I am finding it just isn't a necessary appliance for my kitchen.  My mom has one and just loves it.  She cooks all her chickens in it, small turkey breasts and larger sized roasts.  I have cooked my chicken in it and it did turn out well. However, I continually needed to check it to make sure it wasn't burning on the bottom.  It is much easier for me to put the whole chicken in a cooking bag in the oven.  In terms of the slow cooker portion of the roaster, the things that I have tried to slow cook I haven't used enough of (we're a small family) and the food hasn't cooked all day like I would want it to without being burned and dried out.  As a result, I ended up purchasing a 4 quart slow cooker which I just love and the portions I use in it are the right size for our family.This appliance is big and you need to have enough room to store it.  I think if you have a large family and are cooking large portions, this should work well for you.",1

Secondly, it had a bagel feature which left the bagels very light when bagels should be very dark. Despite these deficiencies, the product did have one redeeming feature. The handle that allowed one to lift the toast out of the toaster to varying heights was very handy and unique compared to many other toasters.",1

At that point, I switched to my double boiler, which worked fine.My advice is don't buy this product.  Invest in a double boiler.I'm rating the product a one because it doesn't work.  Also, it's too small.  With such a small quantity of chocolate in the pot (it will hold 12 oz of chips), I would have needed to melt 2 rounds of chips.  With 3 hours and counting to get the first batch melted, I didn't have time to melt another pack in the Fondue",1

When the other review said that you couldn't hear it from the other room they were being generous. You literally can't hear it from like 3 feet away unless you REALLY concentrate. So buy it if you just think it's cute - it is. But still you will have to buy a TIMER for your kitchen or you're gonna burn the cookies.,1

I thought it looked really nice and it does go well with the other appliances in my kitchen, but it doesn't work worth a damn. SInce day one my toast has been unevenly toasted. And even at the highest setting, my bread is more slightly warm and over-dry than actually toasted.

It isn't a cheap product, but I thought it would be nice if I could save dryer time and not use fabric softener sheets.However, with my home dryer, drying time was the same, and it didn't soften laundry at all. At least, I didn't notice any difference. If people still need to use fabric softener sheets, what is the point? If I had known this result, I wouldn't have bought this. I am very disappointed",1

1674,"Don't waste your money!!. I have a lot of low-voltage lights on our house.  Many colors and different wattages, which I dearly love.  Unfortunately, the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights.  One night I used my Panasonic vacuum (which I love) and got over 30!  The motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag--I've never had one survive! Nice jolly subject, right? Often, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand (20 lbs.) while using the hose with attachment in the other.  This gives me over 3 ft. of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is ""gone"" within 1"" of the brush.  OK, the Lentek is rechargeable, doesn't have a power cord and is lite (albeit unwieldly).  After charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1/8"" spider but nothing larger.  After a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you won't get anything then.  Yes, I'm back to the Panasonic and the Lentek?---the ""round file""!",1

This is my first time to use an electric krumkake baker as I previously had the old type you use over the stove.I feel the baker doesn't bake evenly on both sides........the top of the krumkake cookie is nice but the bottom remains on the soggy side which leads me to believe the heat is uneven.Also there is no indicator light to let you know when the cookie is done.  Therefore you have to really pay attention to your time. Usually it took only 55 seconds to a minute. Also hard to get two cookies commpletely round..... batter ran into each other. Perhaps my batter was too runny but have used this recipe before on the old iron without trouble.I'm at the point that perhaps the single baker would be better than the double. HOpe to find a person that could demonstrate the two cookie krumkake maker......perhaps that would help. Trying to be open-minded!,1
1677,"Rusty knives and worse customer service. I got these knives as a gift. Ironically, the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped ""Stainless Steel"".Let's be realistic. These knives are cheap. They're thin and they're not well weighted. However, they say stainless steel, and you figure that that's what you're getting. I hand-washed these knives and dried them immediately, but they still corroded.Now comes the bad part. I wrote to their customer service department twice and didn't hear back. I finally got their address (from the post office) and sent them back the knives. It took three months of me emailing and calling them (with 15+ minute wait times for Each Call) to get them to send me a replacement set.The replacement set rusted in about two weeks. That was in September. I just got off the phone with Miracle Blade, a call during which I was interrupted so many times that I actually had to say ""I'm going to finish my sentence"" so their rep would stop talking. They won't refund my money. In fact, they won't refund Anyone's money after 30 days. The lifetime warranty is for replacement only. They'll send me another set of soon-to-be-rusty knives, of course--if I pay the shipping and handling...Again. I asked the rep for his full name, for his ID#, and for a manager, and he refused all requests.In summary, if you buy these knives, they will rust. You will want to get rid of them. Your only option will be the garbage can",1

1679,"Not what it used to be. I had what was supposed to be the same model for many years and it worked very well, although the push-down handle broke off two years ago.  The toaster finally became stuck in reheat mode, so I decided to replace it with the same model.  Not possible.  The newer incarnation of the Classic is much less sturdy and the push-down mechanism would not engage - that is, you could not push the handle down and have it stay down to toast.  I returned it and set out to find a better toaster - no easy task.",1
1680,"Don't expect too much.... I bought this vacuum as a cheap ""in between"" vacuum while I saved up to get a better one.  It did a pretty good job cleaning my small apartment for about a month.  It has a nice LED which tells you when you need to clean the cup and filter. This is also, unfortunently, when the vacuums suction has dwindled to nill.  This happens often.  After a few minutes of medium to heavy cleaning, the whole thing needs to be cleaned, otherwise your just pushing the thing back and forth for show.  After about a month, this condition became permanent.  The light stayed on, and the vacuum was basically useless.  I hesitate to give this product one star, because it would probably be good for small jobs and light cleaning.  Just don't buy it and expect it to be your primary vacuum",1
1681,"Totally Disappointed. I brought this item looking at its high ratings. It didn't take long to find out what was wrong with this cooker.The first time, it didn't blow any whistle. I thought maybe I had put less water in it so that it couldn't build enough pressure. Second time it was worse, I filled the water, careful not to exceed the safety mark and closed the lid. Soon, water droplets started coming out of the edges. Thinking that it'd stop soon, I let it go. This time, the steam started coming out from the edges and more heavily from between the handles. It burnt the food and didn't pressure cook it.I'm returning this product within a week of buying it",1

It ""brews"" very quickly, losing a ""cup"" or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top.  The coffee is weak and bitter (no matter what brand we have tried).  About the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed, creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop.  We thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly, and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on. The same thing has happened twice more. This coffeemaker is a piece of junk",1
1683,"Scary! Melted the bottom. I used to agree with great comments of fellow consumers. Today I experienced very scary part of it. When my wife kept the cooker for little longer than used to be( less than 45min), we started smelling metal. When we went to kitchen we couldn't believe our eyes, the bottom of the cooker melted and dripped down as molten metal, ...it was so scary. I do have pictures of it all and will be going for consumer protection on this item. Just thought of let you all future buyers and current owners know about it.",1
1684,"Bad design, too many parts to clean, long juicing time, small capacity. I read all the positive reviews, and after using this unit I can only say that those giving the Omega 8005 a positive rating must have either very low standards or nothing better with which to compare.I have a Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite, arguably the pinnacle of consumer-level juicers. This thing is fast, easy to clean, and exceptionally well designed from a usability standpoint. The industrial design is tremendous, and everything is sized perfectly and makes sense.The Omega 8005, unfortunately, doesn't compare. It's feed tube is so incredibly small that you can only feed a single stem of kale at a time, or risk jamming the tube. The Omega 8005 is absolutely useless to juice anything other than grass or simple greens because of its inability to handle a decent quantity at one time. Even the tray that sits atop the feed chute is shallow, narrow, and utterly useless because whatever you put into it quickly falls out.It takes me a good 10-15 min. to juice two bunches of parsley and one bunch of kale, excluding clean-up, simply because you have to cautiously feed each item or risk a jam. The amount of juice produced is under 4 oz., enough green juice for one person. If I had to spend 10-15 min. juicing for each person (not including cleanup) in my household, that's a good 45 min. of juicing time plus cleanup.Although the Breville isn't particularly adept at juicing leafy greens, it can produce 8 oz. of juice in under 10 seconds from items such as carrots, apples, oranges, pineapples, tomatoes, grapefruits, etc. Such items make absolutely no sense to juice in the Omega 8005 because it would take an inordinate amount of time to chop everything up into the small 1 inch squares that are required to fit through the feed chute.When the feed chute jamps (quite often), the supplied plunger is inadequate to exert enough leverage to force the produce down the chute. When you do exert force, the entire juicer tips unless you use both hands -- one to force the produce down, the other to physically hold the juicer down.Cleanup is a big chore. The Breville has large, easy parts to rinse, but the Omega 8005 has easily double the number of parts that require cleaning. The parts are smaller, with a lot more nooks and crannies requiring attention.Photos of the Omega 8005 show a single container underneath the juicer to catch both juice and pulp, which is ridiculous. The container provided is not large enough to properly catch pulp, unless you enjoy having pulp all over your counter. Contrary to the representations made on the packaging and in the instructions, you need to use two containers: one for the juice and the other for the pulp. This machine contains a multitude of design flaws that are further exacerbated by undersized parts which inhibit usability and functionality.It seems to produce slightly more juice from greens than the Breville, although not by a quantity significant enough to mitigate the amount of time and frustration spent in using this underpowered, undersized, and badly designed machine. Juice is very thick and pulpy, with small pepper-sized pieces of the original vegetable present in the juice. Very annoying, especially since none of this is an issue with the Breville.You will read people claiming that juice from the Omega 8005 is healthier because it has less froth and is not subject to the ""warming"" of a centrifugal design, thereby retaining more of its nutrients. This could not be farther from the truth. The Omega 8005's single impellar produced plenty of heat from friction, and juice comes out substantially warmed from its cold refrigerator state. I have noticed no such warming in the Breville 800JEXL, and can't help but believe that users of the Omega 8005 once again are deluding themselves into believing marketing hype that simply isn't true (i.e., it's a big lie). As far as froth is concerned, yes, the Omega 8005 produces far less froth -- but at the expense of a pulpier juice with pepper-sized gritty fragments of vegetable in it. Given the choice, I'll take the cleaner juice with the froth and just skim off the froth.I did not purchase from Amazon, but from another store that had a better price. I wish I had bought from Amazon, as I could probably return the thing now that I've discovered its many flaws. I can't imagine anybody using this to juice anything of any substance -- it would take just too darn long.In short: don't buy this machine. Unless you specifically need to juice greens for the maximum amount of extraction and are willing to put up with a badly designed unit, pass this one up and go for the gold: the Breville 800JEXL. You won't regret it",1

1686,"Be Cautious!. I purchased the cat it fountain, and for about 1-2 months, it was the greatest thing I could have imagained for my cats. They were drinking fresh water and it was great for them, they loved it. Very shortly however, it began to break down. The valve broke during routine washing. The water never formed a continuous stream over the dome, even after ""running my hand over the dome to release the static electricity."" I was lucky if there was a single stream, but I took it because the water was at least getting cycled. Now, 90% of the time, my $40 investment won't even throw me the smallest of streams, effectively turning my investment into an electricity wasting door stop. Sometimes, when I am lucky and seat it just right, it will give me a stream.It's touch and go... just be warned",1

Bad, Bad Servic",1
1688,"Durability issues. I've owned this vacuum for 3 years. Most features are OK for $150 vacuum cleaner. My issues are the unit, due to its wheel design, gets tougher to pull around on carpet. I tip the unit over often due to this. Also, like another reviewer said, if you've got wood floors, or tile, the absence of an attachment for that type of flooring is missed. The powerhead in the ""off"" position is not the same. Lastly, the powerhead stopped working after just 3 years of light duty (we have a 2 story house and have a vacuum on each floor, so it only has to vacuum 1/2 a house). Like another reviewer, the nearest Sanyo repair center is 1 1/2 hours away. The unit only carries a 1 year warranty, so I'm outta luck. They sent me to a website to buy a replacement powerhead...it's $130...as much as buying the whole vacuum. As in most areas, the hourly charge on fixing electronics continues to go up, so if it takes a couple of hours at $50/hr (or higher in some areas, I'm sure), I may as well buy a new vacuum.Good points are the way you empty the unit, the filter system, and it seems to do OK on carpets.",1
1689,gets loose all by itself - not recommended. I love the look of this collar and the idea is great that it pulls loose when/if it gets caught on something so the cat can get away BUT I find that it comes loose on its own!!

1690,"Piece of junk. I've owned 2 of the previous model of Scum Buster and I was looking forward to purchasing this new design.  What a disappointment!   I put in a water type cleaner and on the second use the nozzle was clogged. To clean it, yu have empty the reservoir, wasting all of the cleaning product that was in it.  When taking it apart to clean it, a black piece fell out which didn't show on the diagram of parts so I had no way to know what is was or where it went.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!I don't know what has happened to Black and Decker, at one time they made quality products but not any more.  I bought an electric floor cleaner made by them a couple of months ago which was also a piece of junk.  I will never buy another Black and Decker product and would advise anyone looking to buy another brand",1
1691,"I expected more from Henckels. I gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months, even cut through chicken bones.  But just like the other reviews, the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment.  I used these for making chicken soup alot, but noticed that it also doesn't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken I like to be extra careful. So the next set I get I'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from Henckels this time",1

It is also difficult to clean in certain parts that are hard to access for scrubbing, but good at trapping orange mold.

1695,"Just too flimsy to rely on. We travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we're sleeping.  The materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence.  The main body is plastic.  The metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door.  The serrations on the bar are not deep, so don't promise much strength.  While none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in, this one, while prettily-designed is overly expensive and unimpressive. We're going to try a few others.By the way, in returning this item, which we consider unsatisfactory, Amazon will charge us doubly:  the cost to return the item to Amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our ""Super Saver"" shipping.  The end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer",1

It is a great blender for crushing ice for smoothies/icees, etc., however it has a flaw that the piece that the pitcher sits on when it spins is made out of plastic. It eventually cracks from the heat/friction produced. I bought the Oster Beehive blender to replace it, and it has a metal piece beneath it and I have had it for a few years now with no problem. I am even happier with the Oster Beehive blender, as it is a much better quality blender which will last a lot longer than the Cuisinart one (it was also cheaper), and it crushes ice exactly as good if not better than the Cuisinart blender",1

1706,"Outstanding growth medium. I am editing this review for clarity. No, I am not talking about carbon.This is one of the best Brita filter systems I've used. I also use the large water cooler model that offers hot and cold dispensing, and I've used several pitcher sizes over the years. This large dispenser fits almost anywhere and holds far more water than the pitcher sizes. The valve works perfectly and closes securely. So, if capacity is more important than portability, this is a great dispenser. Because of the valve, kids can use this much easier than they might a full, large pitcher.My only problem with it is the mould-like stuff that grows in mine. No, that's not the carbon all us Brita users are used to ignoring. It's fuzzy stuff that grows in clumps and sticks to the plastic and is very hard to remove. Maybe that's because the large upper reservoir remains damp and closed longer than a smaller pitcher system would and because it's upstairs where my air conditioning doesn't reach. It's hot up there most of the year.And because of the relatively small, but convenient, filler opening, it's not easy to see into the reservoir through it. So, it's easier to just keep filling without looking into it until filler time. I was going to discard this, but after realizing that nobody in the household got sick, I decided to keep it. I'm leaving the one-star rating in place because I can't edit it, and because I'm tired of household members who complain about the growths. Hey, that's what the faucet is for. What do they think grows in there?",1

1717,"Good coffee.  Not worth the aggravation!. A friend of ours bought this for us.  He owns several coffee shops and we were excited to have great coffee at home.  Out of the box, I needed to tinker with it for a while and had to refer to online chat rooms to figure out how to get it to work correctly.  The problem was that the coffee didn't stay perculating long enough in the top and then it shot down into the carafe. I called Bodum of North America and their customer service person was a surley $$***!!!!!!*****.  They offered no help at all and had no idea what I was talking about which unless they totally disregard internet reviews was a lie.  Several people wrote, in online articles, to cut down the tube that goes in to the carafe by small dimension.  I didn't do that but I learned that if you don't push the top down all the way it will work okay.After I got it working okay, it did make really good, and hot coffee.  Then the poorly designed flip top broke and Bodum has never had it back in stock (I wonder why!),  then we got really sick of trying (in vane) to clean the inside of the carafe.  Finally the annoyance of the thing as a whole overrode the quality of the coffee.My advice is if you want really great coffee go to your local cafe.  For day to day coffee at home don't buy this.It looks cool and does make good coffee but at a big price",1

1720,"Not for the 17400. Listen to Lynn from New England, I wish she had written her review before I purchased these.The 17400 model that I use requires 2 of these HRF-14 filters and 2 foam spacers. The reduction in the quality of the filtered air is very noticeable. (The plastic edges of the 2 HEPA filters touching in the middle + the two foam spacers at the end reduce the total filter surface area dramatically) Also, changing the prefilter is much more of a hastle when you are trying to juggle 4 pieces wrapped by the prefilter instead of one. I suppose you could use heavy duct tape to keep them bound together, but then you would lose even more filtering capacity.The competition's late night infomercials try to demonstrate that the Honeywell (I am pretty sure they show the 17400) is difficult to clean, but because it isn't when using the single HEPA filter, the actors overdramatize and you can tell it. If they had used THIS filter set up in their demo, though, it would have been much more convincing.This may be slightly cheaper in the (very) short run, but in the long run, if you would rather not have to replace the HEPA filter more often and if you want your Honeywell to work at maximum efficiency, use the single filter option instead.",1

I have no idea what Hoover's engineers were thinking when they came up with this rotating HEPA filter concept...the filter stopped rotating after the second use and requires EXTENSIVE cleaning after every vacuuming session, or the suction drops to almost nothing.  You have to manually rotate the filter after each use to dislodge a ton of fine dust that plugs the filter, and usually makes a huge mess that has to be cleaned up with another vacuum while this one is disassembled.  I'd love to take it back for a refund, but it's too late now.  The first and last Hoover product I ever buy....",1
1725,well!!!. At first I thought it was great. The cat likes it and loves to watch it clear itself. Now the cat uses it to poo but not to pee. There is way!!! to much cat litter. When it cleans itself it trys to pulls half the cat litter into the SMALL cardboard tray. I still have to clean the box once a week which I guess is better than three times a day. I guess our cat poos a lot. The poo does get stuck in the prongs from time to time and that is your que to clean the tray out. I also don't like that the cat really shuffles the litter around before he goes so it sets the sensor off and we have to shake the box often or just push the button to get it to run. That is kind of anoying. I think they really need to make some adjustments to the box but if you have an older cat that doesn't dig a lot or poop a lot then this is the box for you. Be aware though you will most likely have to clean it every week. I had to actually flip the lid around so the cat would push the litter away from the tray. He was helping push the litter into the tray so it would fill up clean litter and the poop would get stuck in the grid. All in all it's not to bad!,1

As mentioned in other reviews, this tray fills up very fast. There's a nozzle that dispenses hot water directly into the tray towards the back of the machine (not sure why). I think what is happening is that the hot water bows the plastic tray slightly but enough to cause jamming. By jamming, I mean I have to pull so hard to slide the tray out that I'm afraid I'll break it. This is not just a minor annoyance since you'll have to turn the whole machine upside down in the sink to empty the tray. Hopefully, my experiences were the exception and not the rule, or this problem can be avoided by emtying out the tray more frequently. Me personally, I expect a machine to be idiot-proof.

Not sure what the warping problem is cause I have only used it once...to try and turn the pancake and washed by hand.  I tried putting a weight on the leading edge and leaving it weighed down several days but when I checked to see if that fixed it...it was still warped",1
1740,"I love to use it, but hate to clean it. I have had this for years and it is great to use. I am a college student often cooking for just myself and find it very quick and nice. My major problem is in its cleaning. People may say it is easy to clean, but it really isnt. The lid only does not completely open making the top hard to clean and the whole thing is really just a pain. I still use it, but curse it afterwards. I would reccommend getting a little more expensive model with removable plates. Trust me, for the extra money it is definitely worth it. I am looking forward to getting the new one with multiple removable plates",1
1741,"Deluxe? Try ""Cheap"". I decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it.  The metal is thin and flimsy, and the construction very poor (e.g., little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose).  Also, it was a bit lopsided, so it did not sit squarely on my counter.Maybe it works fine.  Who knows.  The design and manufacture were so poor, I didn't keep it long enough to find out",1

I guess they want you to buy a new waffle maker, which I will.  But you can bet it won't be Black & Decker.  I don't care if it's just a waffle maker or if it's a car, the company that sells a product must stand behind it or I'm looking elsewhere.  And that goes for Black & Decker drills, saws, and other tools as well.  I'm done with them",1
1746,"Cereal dispenser problem. I ordered this cereal dispenser for my adult son.  He filled it with raisin bran.  When he turned the knob to release the cereal into a bowl, the flakes of cereal broke up.  Some missed the bowl and went on the floor.  He's going to try putting Cheerios in it to replace the raisin bran.  If it doesn't work well with the Cheerios, I plan to return the item",1
1747,"Not built to last. I had my machine for 6 weeks, I loved it! I didn't like the coffee pot - it was very light and I was so worried I'd break it, but it made good espresso and it was easy to use.  BUT...after 5 weeks I was having trouble getting it to pump the espresso.  I thought the filter was clogged, but it wouldn't even put out water without a filter.  So, I returned it.  The guy told me ""we get a lot of these back"".  Apparently, the pump had failed...after only 6 weeks",1
1748,"Terrible product. My husband and I bought this toaster looking to upgrade. This toaster was the biggest waste of money. Sounds like many other reviewers had trouble with their toast being burned, but we couldn't even get that far. From the moment we took it out of the box, we had trouble even getting the toasting lever to stay down. After a couple of months it wouldn't stay down at all, and we'd have to stand there holding the lever down to get the toaster to work. We recently replaced this toaster with a cheaper Philips toaster, which so far is working gloriously well. Stay away from T-Fal",1
1749,"Junk!!!. I don't know if these positive reviews are coming from Gaggia employees, but the machine is an overpriced piece of junk!  Leaking, loud, hard to use/clean, this machine didn't do as well as my $50 Krups.  I spent a lot of time researching machines, and like an idiot I took these reviews to heart, DON'T believe them!  I am returning the unit tomorrow",1
1750,Terrible!. Buy this vacuum is you want to spread dirt around.  Looks like a nice little cleaner but dirt just shoots back at your feet.  Does an okay job on carpet but worthless on bare floors.  I have to go over them many times to pick up anything.  I consider it a complete waste of money and time.  It took a some time to put together so once you find out it's a piece of junk you have to take it all apart and box it up to return it.  For the price I didn't even bother.  Spend a little more money and buy a better machine,1

I hate the taste of food cooked in this pot.Yes, the aluminum gets hot enough to burn fingers.  I don't know about the handles cracking - maybe that would happen in another year, but I'm not going to wait to find out.I've used the crock pot for soups, either presoaking lentils (peas, etc) or cooking the soup or both.

On the 2nd use, the first belt broke. It goes through belts like my 3 year old goes through clothes. The hose won't consistently stay clamped to the handle, falling into your knees as you try to push the thing. I can't get through a single job without it clogging and respreading the dirt everywhere as I try to unclog it. Its a 3-4 step process if it clogs further inside the filter sending me into a full-blown asthma attack (and my asthma is pretty mild). Its going to the curb on the next trash pick-up because now the clamp that holds it locked upright is now broken and I don't even know how that managed to happen. I guess at about $90 you get what you pay for. Those Dyson's better be worth the $[...] because I'm getting one tomorrow",1

Frustrated, I accepted the promised $175.00 off to keep the doors, knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later.  I have yet to receive this refund.   The delivery was also a major problem.  There was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go.  There was no way I could get this furniture in my house alone, so I tipped him to bring it in for me.  I will never buy anything from this company again!!!!!!",1
1757,"Do not order this from Amazon!!. I ordered these as a Christmas gift, and although they were ordered before the ""Holiday guaranteed shipping deadline"", they still arrived a few days after Christmas. Also, when they did arrive, they were packed so poorly in the box that one of the crocks was cracked in half. I ended up finding the same exact crocks at a local department store for a lower cost. As much as I've loved the books, electronics, DVD's, etc, that I order from Amazon, I will never order these knowing that the packaging will not get it here in one piece. It was a complete disappointment",1
1758,TERRIBLE TOASTER. This toaster worked great for a month. Then the lever stopped working properly and half the time we can't get the slots to stay down at all. I do not recommend this toaster.  The warranty from Cuisinart is useless - we would have to spend our own money to ship it to them and then include $7 for them to ship a replacement or repaired toaster back.,1
1759,"Buy a different one to use indoors. If you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed...DON'T!I have two areobeds; I bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out.  The pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it. Fifteen years later it still works like a charm.  I liked it so much; I recently bought a Minute bed because I needed another guest bed.  It does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours.  Needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa.  The battery is NiCad, which means it develops a memory, so now even if I remembered to charge it the day before, it does not run long enough to inflate the bed.  They do not offer a separate electric, detachable pump, so now I'm stuck with a ""plastic carpet"" that cannot be inflated with anything else.  The areobeds work great, but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion, buy a different type.",1

As I read these reviews, I keep seeing people rave about how good All-Clad is, not really how an individual pan actually performers.  Yes, I have All-Clad.  Lots of All-Clad.  When the company brings out a new pan, I buy it.  In the small pans that I use the most, I am likely to have 2 of each.  But, I don't recommend the 7-? inch.  All-Clad likes to bring out pans that are almost a `try me'; as was the case with the 7 ? inch and 1 qt pan a few years ago.  They priced them attractively.  To me the pan is handle heavy.  It does not sit properly on my electric stove.  Thus it has poor heat conductivity.  For a few dollars more, buy the 8 inch fry pan.  The 8 inch is US made, and the 7 ? inch is imported.",1
1761,"Terrible--Does Not Work. I'm looking for a timer.  Simple as can be.  I should have listened to the previous reviews.  This thing simply did not work right out of the box.

Yes, the end of the spout is considerably lower than the top of the pot, thus it spills tea all over the place when you make a full pot. I am amazed that apparently nobody tested this design before it went into production.",1
1765,"You only get the small one... I purchased this item, after having read about ""Banneton"" in the book ""Rustic European Breads from your Bread Machine"". The picture clearly shows 4 baskets, and the description is vague - but you only get one. The basket you get is quite small, all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket. It looks sturdy and well made. It would have been good value for four baskets - it was too much to pay for a single basket. I didn't actually use it, choosing instead to return it, so I can't comment on how well it worked..",1
1766,"A Tea kettle that doesn't whistle. In my opinion:  Well, I just wanted a tea kettle for my country kitchen, and I own some Original Franciscan hand Decorated plates. For $23.99 I wasn't expecting an antique, and this certainly isn't, but the decorations on ceramic were acceptable. But, the tea kettle has design flaws when it comes to whistling. The whistle does have a low mellow sound (only when you blow into it!), but it rarely works unless you fill the pot to the top and turn up the heat , which is NOT what they advise you to do. The problem is the fit of the spout cover to the kettle, the whistle being in the cover. Also, the water fill cover fits too sloppily and allows excess steam to escape. The amount of steam that escapes from the spout cover and from the water fill cap could scald you. I returned mine",1

I never liked the super loud beeping sound it would make as you press a button, though. Too loud.Now, the Microwave broke completely (won't run), and I'm having to send it back for a replacement",1

1769,"We loved it...while it worked- update they replaced it!. We bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black & decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months.  I thought if I upgraded a bit, I could get a bit more milege out of it- like maybe 2 years...but now with only 5 months of usage...suddenly no power.  Totally dead.  It is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center aren't too outrageous we'll try that route, other wise, looks like another waste of money.  I have to say that while it did work, we enjoyed it.  It was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven, and made great bacon in the warmer- a bonus we weren't expecting.update to this review: I sent in to warranty center and they replaced it with a new one.  It took a while and then they sent the wrong item (same name different product-honest mistake) but were very very nice when I called and sent the right one out right away- now just hoping this one lasts more than 5 months",1

The small cereal bowls were sent twice (quickly but wrong size both times) and I returned both orders. I was sent an e-mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and I would not be receiving the larger bowls. Then I got an e-mail saying I was being billed for them to which I replied what I received was NOT what I ordered and had been returned twice. I have all the paperwork on both orders. The plates I ordered were never received at all. I have NO idea what is going on now. It makes sense that I be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn't happening eithe,1

I'm not a violent person but when coffee floods your counter you want to crush it.  The only way to safely make a pot of coffee is to place it in the sink for fear of flooding.  Even with the lid perfectly clean and on properly, it leaks coffee between the carafe and the lid.To boot, pouring water into the reservoir is a chore & no matter how careful you are, you will have coffee on the counter.  Like another reviewer the clock does not keep time.  You need to reset it on a regular basis.For the first 30 days or so I actually liked the thing but as you can tell my opinion has definitely changed.  Good luck to you if you buy this product.",1
1775,"Not worth the money. I purchased this because I thought that it would be a convenient fryer to own. I thought that since it was one of the more expensive fryer available, it must be good.  Oil leaked all over my kitchen before I even had a chance to use it.  If you're going to buy this, make sure that the oil does not leak through the valve before you set it in the frame.  You may have to play with the valve a little to make sure that it's tight.  I had to keep this fryer because it was too much trouble to return to Amazon.  Save your money and buy something less tricky",1
1776,"bad buttons!. After my first Cuisinart hand mixer died from 10 years of heavy use, I decided to be brand loyal. Now, I am questionning my decision. The buttons for increasing/decreasing speed seem to be backwards (not intuitive!) -- I would prefer they were reversed. Beyond that, the button to eject the beaters cracked and the pieces fell inside the mixer after just a few uses. Additionally, the power seems weak - especially for cookie dough. I am very disappointed",1
1777,"Hated it, threw it away and learned how to use real hones. Get a couple of good hones instead and learn to use them. I got one of these a couple of years ago. I figured I would now enter ""easy sharp knife heaven"", but it ruined all my knives. They are sharp, but only kind of sharp. It ground the bevels to flat and I never managed to get anything that was remotely razor sharp, and trust me, I have tried. Anyhone who says razor sharp, doesn't really mean razor razor sharp or may never have seen a really sharp knife. If it isn't as sharp as that scalpel you used in biology class, it is not razor sharp.I recently bought the book Razor Edge sharpening, and a couple of Razor Edge hones and hand reground all the knives I had ruined (doesn't take long if you do it right, even form a destroyed edge). Now I finally have the ultra scalpel sharp knives I always wanted. So sharp it is almost scary. Good hones aren't cheap either, but you can use them for your other tools too, like chisels, etc",1
1778,NO QUALITY AT ALL. I purchased one of the shark pro steamers and used it once.  Came back to it a month later and the cap had seized totally shut.  They are aware of the problem but fail to document it or do anything about it.  The steamer is about 100 buck and to send it back for repair is 25 buck shipping and another 50 to Inspect.  For that price I should just toss it in the trash or use it as a $100 paper weight that's all it's good for.  Don't buy anything from euro pro!!!! they make junk.,1
1779,"Haven't even used it, and it's already defective. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon. It was one of two crock pots they sold, so there wasn't much choice. I had to replace my previous Rival as steam kept coming out of the lid and spewing liquid everywhere, and the knob melted off!!Right away this lid doesn't even fit the crock. Not only does it rock back and forth, it has a gap in it that you can actually see inside of. I get that you can't pressure seal these things, but I can see steam, liquids, and what-not spewing from this one too. After reading the reviews of it being too hot, I am returning it",1
1780,"Great cutting power, but blade lock is badly designed. I was thrilled when I first began to use this project - it's very sharp & very strong, crunching through small bones with ease.  However, the safety lock is in a bad place - it's small & easily engaged, and on quite a few occasions now, the mere action of cutting - when the lock gets sideswiped by the chicken itself - will engage the lock, and then I have to manually open it up again.  It's EXTREMELY irritating - I would call it a major design flaw.  If it weren't for that lock, I'd reccomend these shears to anyone - but I'd hesitate to recommend them now.  I will deal with them, and I'm sure there's a way to learn to live with them well (after all, they do cut beautifully, so long as you can avoid activating that lock) - but I don't feel there should need to be a ""break-in"" period for a new pair of poultry shears",1

I called the company's tech support line, and left a message (it was a weekend) and they never called me back. I called them on the following Monday and I was hung up on once, and when I called back the person who answered rudely told me to return it through the website company at which I had purchased it.

In this state, it is still possible to move it from the sink to the floor with minimal spilling.  If you fill it on the floor, and fill it to the very rim (including the clear reservoir and the top fountain reservoir), the fountain maxes out at ~190 oz, anymore and it promptly spills over the edge.

However, the thin material of the boards warps/cups, making the board rock on its center on the counter.

The only solution I have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it. Frankly, that's more trouble than it's worth.

In hindsight, he wasn't looking out for our fish, but for his profit.Even though betas CAN live in small spaces, I would not recommend it.  Even for one beta, this tank is too small.  It gets dirty easily and needs to be cleaned once a week, which is an immense stress on the fish.  The fake plants provided with the tank don't help with the water quality either.For now, we moved our beta to a large glass baking bowl, and we are in the process of shopping for a larger tank with an undergravel filter and live plants, plus a heater.

I've burned myself accidentally bumping into it.To sum up:Positives- Food comes out fine- Product has lasted yearsNeutrals- Price is okNegatives- no cool touch side insulation- no temp control- no fry basket.. comes only with a tiny scooper- plastic lid melts. you have to wait hours to put it on.- not easy to clean.  no parts come off, so you just have to wipe it out. it's also hard to pour the oil out because you have to lift the whole thing.This fryer is ok all in all, but there are so many better ones out there for about the same price.",1

After following instructions in detail, the frother I received keeps getting stuck in the 'on' position and also seems to have 2 speeds.  Also, just to prove a point more to myself, I frequently have to take the top/cap off and press the button to get it to go fast (I don't actually use it to froth this way) ... or use 2 hands to hold it and press the button which is very awkward and then even that doesn't help sometimes.  The bottom line is that it will very seldom operate at it's normal speed or it gets stuck on!!  Clearly this frother isn't working the way it should and is somehow getting stuck or the button doesn't go down enough.  I was going to keep it anyway, but decided to return it as I seem to have no control over wheather it wants to go fast or slow.

Items or colors listed as in stock and shipping (the pizza plate for example)get listed as backordered after you purchase and languish for months before the order is inexplicably canceled.2.) Items that are seconds quality being sold as first quality. On average, 10% of our orders included slay slubs, glaze missing in spots and other imperfections.3.) Range of products severely limited4.)

Also, with mine at least, you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear. A shame, since the cat really did like the few bubbles I was able to coax out.If this somehow filtered the water AND made bubbles, I'd be all over it (like cat hair on a pastel couch)",1

It is not readily apparent from the picture but this product is actually shaped like a small cylinder, 3cm high with ~ a 6cm diameter. The cylinder twists apart in the middle to open. The problem is that first of all it is not tall enough to grasp firmly and has no 'handle' points, and second the actual locking mechanism is simply based on a push and twist design, but the metal parts do not fit together properly and are very hard to twist. Wrenching the teaball seems a good way to get tea all over the floor.In fact, this first day I received the teaball I practiced opening it several times and eventually it became stuck, I was unable to open it until the next morning. Even if my particular product was somehow bent I cannot see how this mechanism could hold up to repeated use.Hopefully Amazon will have another teaball soon",1

I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.I threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn't last long at all.

Unfortunately, I second guessed myself after reading some negative reviews of the Swivel Sweeper and purchased this more positively-reviewed (and more expensive) Bissell sweeper about 4 months ago.  Big mistake!  I've been kicking myself ever since.The Bissell sweeper doesn't pick up nearly as well as the S.Sweeper and tends to throw the dirt all over the floor - usually to a place where you just swept.  The wheels and handle are stiff (lubricating didn't help), making it difficult to maneuver.  It's bulky and too tall to fit under many pieces of furniture, whereas the S.S. has a much lower profile.   The S.S. picks up most dirt on the first pass; with the Bissell, I'm having to constantly go back and forth over the same spot.  By far, the greatest advantage of the S.S. is it's ability to swivel 360 degrees.  At my cousin's house I can stand in one spot and just swing the S.S. around on the hardwoods at every-which-angle.  It's light and rolls beautifully.  The Bissell's wheels grip the floor and seem stiff - a great disadvantage.  It's like steering a truck - you have to do multiple K-turns and parallel parking-type maneuvers to move it around - sometimes it's just easier to pick it up off the floor and move it to where you need it.  As for corners and edges, the S.S. does a better job.Buyers of the S.S. complained that it appears ""junky"", and that there are problems keeping a charge.  My cousin has owned her Swivel Sweeper for about a year.  It's used numerous times a day, and she has had zero problems with it.  On the other hand, the right-hand rotating edge brush on my Bissell quit working after about 2 months.  As for the S.S. fragile appearance, don't judge a book by it's cover.  The Bissell looks great and appears sturdy and substantial, but in my opinion is the lesser product by far.",1

(and alcohol is not suppose to freeze) Luckily, I had purchased it at Williams-Sonoma and even w/o a receipt, they refunded the purchase. I only wished it would have worked like it promised, it's an impressive unit and people would just look at it in awe but every time I used it, people would just be disappointed (especially me for what I paid for it!)

This allows you to rest your carafe on the unit and steam your milk while you put away a dish or toast a bagelSimple to operate and pleasant to look atNice ergonomic features like a storage compartment for the accessories under the unit, removable foam wand, etc.ConsIt fails horribly at its core function, making good expresso and steaming/foaming your milk.I use pods and the machine takes very long to pull the shot, it splattered all over (due to the funky way they try to ""create"" crema), and the ultimate product was weak & bitterThe steam was very weak, took about 30% longer to warm up my machine than any machine we tested, and it was very inconsistent in how much steam it injected.The machine wastes a lot of water.  They are proud of all the priming and purging features, but as it steams and belches it makes quite the mess.  I found myself reaching for a sponge and towel several times during the brewing process.Net this is a great machine architecturally but a horrid expresso maker.

The PS2, and DVD cases are too big to fit into these slots. I had just not realized that they would not work with this model. The whole reason I ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room, so this will not work for me. I will probably try to return it, and order the newer model",1

With the amount of noise it makes, you would hope that it would be removing dirt from the floor.

Somebody buy it from me PLEASE!!! I'm sick of looking at it as it takes up space in my home. I purchased the item 3 summers ago. Enjoyed using it 3 or 4 times until the top broke. Just needs a simple part replacement or repair. I've written & emailed Tristar several times without a single response. Other customers write about their troubles in dealing with the service phone operators. In doing the math a great product plus a company who's actual service practices drains their customers that equals a juicer I don't want to look at.

Even if you stack up all 4 of them, they squish completely flat and are worthless as pillows. Plus, the feathers are of very low guality and are mostly hard quills that stick you in the face.

This is creamware and it should be creamy white with no dirty looking spots on it. I love the pattern, the size of the plates, everything but the quality. They really need to address this problem at the factory, and not sell seconds as top quality china",1
1872,"If I could I would give it and it's mfg negative stars!. This thing was the biggest waste of $200+ that I have ever spent.  First off, I bought it to mainly clean hard floors (vinyl flooring mostly) but the steam sprays forward from one nozzel as opposed to down onto the floor.  It sprays forward into a terry pocket that fits on the end of a wand, so the terry gets soaking wet and the floor gets the same cleaning as if you mopped with hot water!  I used to own a Eureka Enviro-steamer that sprayed the steam down through several vents directly thru a terry bonnet onto the floor... straight down!!  The Eureka worked fabulously except that I had to refill it 3 or 4 times to do all my floors so I gave it away and wasted my hard earned $$$ on this piece of garbage.  Now, fast forward to 8 months after I buy it and the on/off switch that controls the steam flow is broken and I cannot turn it OFF!!   So I can't use this thing at all because it doesn't build up pressure because the water is spraying out of the tip before it can generate any steam because it won't shut off!!  I called the company after an hour of searching the web to find out who to call and guess what????? I have to pay to ship this thing to them with ALL the attachments and then pay to have it shipped back to me!!! DO I NEED TO SPEND ANOTHER 40 OR 50 DOLLARS ON SHIPPING?????????  Needless to say, I'm aggravated as all get-out over this thing and my husband is mad that I gave away the Eureka on top of it all!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! BETTER YET, EVEN IF YOU ARE OFFERED IT FOR FREE DON'T BOTHER!!!",1
1873,"Not Recommended. The unit is designed more for an external appeal, but not for real use. If you're buying a fish tank for a certain style, then this might work for you. If you want to keep fish, stay away!A lot of people reviewing this tank may not have a good understanding of aquaria, or what tank filtration and maintenance should be.  This is the only reason I can see as to why it gets good reviews.  Read below and you'll see in detail why I do NOT like this tank, and why I think it's bad even for beginners.However, nothing is all-bad, and I want to start with the Good Things:What I LIKE about this tank:- Acrylic looks nice.  The best way to describe it is that it looks like it's not there.- Acrylic doesn't way as much as glass- I've never had cloudy waterWhat I don't like:- Hard to maintain due to poor design:The opening/lid is very small. It can only be used to feed the fish, and supposedly change the filter cartridge.  Want to scrape algae? Scoop up floating debris(from plants, etc).  Better take the top off.  If you DO take the top off, it's bulky, since the light is integrated, you can no longer see in the tank to do any work! In addition, the light causes condensation of the top of the lid, so wherever you set it will get very wet.  If you're lucky enough to have somewhere to set the top so you can SEE, the surface WILL get very wet when the condensation drips onto the surface.  In addition, the entire back half is occupied by the filter(which I'll get to later), and the front has a support bar. for a 20"" tank? That means you have 10"" on either side to work, and with 4"" in the back gone, you're working in a 4.5""x 6"" area... this makes catching a fish, or scrubbing algae a pain because you're always taking your hand out of the water to skip to the other side.  This causes water to drip off your hand all over the place.  Acrylic also scratches easily, and is impossible to cover up once scratched.  Glass is more durable (but much heavier)-- The Filter:This is a filter? It apparently does a good job keeping my water clear, but if you look at the design (Impeller pulls water up in to a ""trough"" that flows water across the length of the tank OVER (that's right, not THROUGH) the filter media, at the end, it flows over a ""bio-wheel"" and back into the tank.  Because it flows OVER the filter there is potential for a LARGE amount of bypass of mechanical filtration. This means a lot of gunk will stay in your water. Filter pads are a bit on the pricey side. Some will tell you they just rinse in tank water, but how do you replace the carbon?  Also, if I have a power outage while I'm at work, I'll come hope and have to ""prime"" the filter to get it going again.  Cleaning the filter involved removing this ""trough"" from the tank top, removing the impeller (that clogs easily). It's bulky and hard to work with.- The Bio Wheel:  If there has ever been a case of undeserved hype this is it.  Marineland has somehow convinced people, even very knowledgeable fish people that this is the best thing since sliced bread.  ""This"" is a case of the emperors no clothes!  It may ""work"", but no better, if even as well as other methods.  Color me unimpressed.  My reasons? I've tried this and the Emperor and actually get slower/worse biological filtration than on a simple AquaClear.   The wheel is another moving part, creating noise(splash noises) and occasionally stops. When it stops, the can bacteria DIE!   What's more is that every time I change the filter pad, the tank goes through a mini cycle again.  What does this tell me? That much of the nitrifying bacteria is living on the pad and not the wheel.  Even supporters of the biowheel will tell you that this happens.- The light:  It's a compact fluorescent, and it proprietary. It is located in the center, so the sides of the tank tend to be darker.  The tank is not evenly lit!- Surface Area  The tank measures 20.5(front)17.25(back)x10 deep.    When you keep fish, how many you can keep is about surface area.  The eclipse has about 205 square inches of surface area, negligible to a 10 gallon, and far less than a much cheaper 20 gallon kit(288 square inches) and with a standard 24x12 footprint, you have better options and prices on stands as well.- A standard 10/20/29 gallon would be much more cost effective. A 29 gallon would be about the same price at a Eclipse at more than twice the volume. If space is an issue, a 20 gallon isn't much larger(3 inches across the front, 2 inches deeper) You can get a complete kit with heater and filter for much cheaper, Shoot, you can buy the tank and hood and pick your own filter and heater and still save money.   These tanks are easy for to maintain, Stands are common and cheap.-	My fish don't seem happy in this tank, when I move them to other tanks, they seem to perk up.  Granted, this is not fair as this is my smallest tank, but in general, fish prefer room.  Maybe if you bought guppies and neon tetras. A single Goldfish would work well, or two small goldfish.If I were just getting started and purchased this tank, this may be my last venture into the world of aquaria. The tank has been a nightmare, and I've had it with the small openings and constant mini cycles.  I'm going to replace it as soon as possible.My personal recommendation is to avoid the nightmare.  Acrylic looks nice, but if you go that rout, don't go with the `eclipse system"".",1
1874,"This is the best thing ever!!!. Man this item is fantastic. I love wasting $80 on pointless furniture. Getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems.... Man I must be in heaven. Not only that but it breaks easily, does this thing have no limit? So I bought this great video center around a year ago.... And what happens it breaks. I had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap. It looks like you're in a baby kids room. Similar to those play centers in day cares or McDonalds. Man that is lame....

1876,"All form,poor function. After waiting a month to receive this item I am very dissapointed in its functionality. The spout is an inconvenient turn valve design as opposed to a push button. I could get over this if it were the only problem, but it is not. If you want to use the jar as a dispenser you will need to remove the gasket on the cover otherwise you will have a vacumn in the container, but even if you do this the flow is TERRIBLY slow and worse when the jar is nearly empty.Looks nice though, might look good on a shelf with some pennies in it.",1

For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again",1

I found at a housewares store (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or the like) a shot glass with several different units of measurement: fluid ounces, teaspoons, tablespoons (in half-tablespoon increments) and ML's.

1881,"Lower your expectations. The first star is because it fits. The measurements are exactly as described. The second star is because it does indeed hold things, including spices. The stars stop there. I'd give another star if the stainless steel was more than an afterthought. Save 50% and get the plastic version. That's what 90% of this product is after all... cheap plastic. I'd give another star if this thing was sturdier. It's flimsy and the ""action"" is herky jerky at best. Contrary to the product listing, it doesn't, ""fit any size bottle or tin... by adjusting the shelves just as you like.""  There are in fact very few shelf positions, and one of the two shelves has only one placement option. The bottom of this thing is one of the most visible parts. They've conveniently left it totally unadorned. There's none of that stainless steel to shine all pretty-like, and the cheap plastic that's there didn't receive any aesthetic attention. I.e. it's rough and ugly. Get the plastic version and spraypaint it to match your kitchen. You'll be happier",1

WHile the concept seems promising, the actual product is a failure.  The carafe is awkward and you have to fiddle with it every time to pour your coffee.  And, the handle simply came off after just 6 months of normal use (a.m. coffee only).  And there is no way to fix it as the bolts are lodged inside and can't be accessed.

1894,"Don't waste your money!. The LitterMaid is designed to automatically empty your litter box, making it easier for busy cat owners like myself. Having owned one for about 3 months I have found significant issues with it:1) It always dumps litter between the cracks of the receptacle, meaning I have to vacuum the area under the LitterMaid everyday.2) It gets stuck very often and I have to manually even out the poop.3) It often pushes much of the unused litter into the receptacle, I have to replace the litter often.4) With two cats, the receptacle has to be replaced every two days because it fills up! The receptacles are about $2 a piece, making this expensive!5) LitterMaid brand litter works the best, but it is $14 a bag which lasts about two weeks with two cats.Bottom line: the LitterMaid is not really an automatic litter box since you are actually performing maintenance on it every other day. I have found that it is just as much work as a regular litter box. Don't waste your money!! I am going to be looking into the Scoop Free automatic litter box system that has gotten some great reviews.",1
1895,"Hate it. Ok well unlike the other reviewers, I hate this ice cream scoop. Yes, it's heavy and seems to be well-engineered. However, I don't like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it. And as another reviewer already mentioned, it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed. When I'm scooping the ice cream, the water drips out and down the handle, thus making it even harder to grip the handle. It makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and I get ice cream all over my hand. I have a cheap $2 plastic scoop that I bought when I was in college, and I prefer it to this one.",1

1906,"Yes, too hot. I like this slow cooker somewhat, but I have to agree - it gets way too hot.  I have been using slow cookers now for 17+ years, so I understand that cooking time will vary based on individual models, food temperature and power source.  But really, you can't use any lower of a setting than *LOW*!  If you plan on cooking your meal while you are out (isn't that the idea here?) you will return to a dried out, overcooked disappointment.  I have even tried using extra liquid and semi-frozen meats with no improvement - still overcooked.  And God forbid, you get stuck in traffic!  You may as well just order pizza from the car!As the hot dog man suggests, it is good for some things.  Mac and cheese in less than two hours comes out nice and creamy (although it does stick to the pot regardless of how well you grease it up).  It also generates less heat than stove top, so we use it during hot summer months to help keep the kitchen cool.  The removeable pot is easy to clean (it better be, since everything sticks while it is overcooking....) and the handles do stay cool. The shape is nice also.  Two stars for that.Overall, if you are going to use the pot for cooking while you are out, I would stay away from this one.",1

I had to order a replacement ""blender cutting assembly"" from the Cuisinart website for $15 with shipping, only to have it happen again.Plus, it was a pain to clean - the base threading didn't match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult.

Though the title clearly advertises that a reservoir is included, one did not arrive.  I contacted customer service who told me that the reservoir is not included and would only assist me in ordering one.  Otherwise, the unit is nice, though simple.  I will be returning it used to purchase elsewhere",1
1917,Find another blanket. I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.,1

1922,"Not worth the price...keep on shopping. I've had the toaster for over 5 years and have enjoyed it very much with the speed it toast and how well it evenly toast.  Owners must use this item with great caution though.  Bagels will need to be squished/flatten or suffer getting stuck and you spending time retrieving the item--be careful with children as they are tempted not to unplug the toaster when inserting their metal fork to retrieve their bagel.  The timer will fail with no warning aside from the day you are preparing for work and the fire detectors go off.  As fate would have it, the timer did not stop so the cooking continued leaving the detectors goings off and dogs barking.  For a short term investment, this is a great item to have but for the long haul, keep on shopping",1
1923,"Lots of problems. Please don't buy this if you think you are going to be juicing carrots and apples and other hard vegetables. Because it is manual, it would take anyone forever to get a 12 oz. glass of carrot juice. I can get a glass of carrot juice in less than 1 minute with my centrifugal juicer which is a Juiceman pro. But, a centrifugal juicer can't do what this little juicer can do, juice grass and leafy greens.I have mixed feelings about this little juicer.  First the pros. This juicer does a fine job of juicing wheatgrass. The pulp is dry and it is not hard to crank. Cleanup is fairly easy. It is portable. It is cheap. You get a slick dvd and extra parts. In an emergency this juicer would be an ideal survivor tool.Now the cons. The so called indestructible plastic auger cracked after the first two weeks of juicing wheatgrass. I have to send it back for a replacement. Sometimes the crank hits the clamp or the edge of the counter. That means I have to readjust the clamp to make sure it is on correctly. Not a big problem but something you have to be careful about. If the lip on your kitchen counter does not protrude out far enough, the clamp might not attach properly. We actually have to open the dishwasher in order to have enough clearance for the clamp to attach under the kitchen counter. I ended up juicing in my backyard attaching the unit to the side table of my grill because of the clamp, the clearances and the drippy mess.Next, the designers decided it would be best to reverse the threads of the end cap. That means in order to tighten it, you turn it counter clockwise. This is the opposite of every standard thread on the planet. It's confusing. In order to take off the end cap after juicing, you have to use the wrench supplied and use a moderate amount of force. I don't like it.Also, the hopper body is hard to slide off the locking base. Sometimes I really have to push it. Next, the juice cup is very close to the handle crank. You have to be careful not to knock over the juice cup as you are cranking. Not a huge deal but again, something you have to put up with.  Lastly, when you slide off the hopper, there are some drips. Because you must attach the locking base close to the edge of a counter, that means some drips on the kitchen floor. It can get messy.I bought an Omega 8005 electric juicer three weeks after buying this healthy juicer. The omega is terrific and has none of the problems I have with the healthy juicer.",1
1924,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I was sooooo happy when I read these reviews because I was ready to give up on slow cooking entirely.  I have burned EVERYTHING I've ever cooked in this- I thought it was me!  I'm actually a great cook and used to make fun of slow cooking, but with a family it made sense.I bought this because i had started with a smaller version and I wanted a larger crock pot with the 10 hour setting.  I had some success with the smaller RIVAL, but it was simply too small to do anything except reheat soup.  I thought I'd try this one since it was bigger, had more features, etc.  WRONG.I promise I'm not exaggerating- after 6 hours in this thing (at the 10 hour setting) everything has been burned beyond recognition- I was told it was impossible to burn anything in a crock pot.  WRONG.Seriously, get another one.  I'm online now searching for a different brand that hopefully won't set my house on fire",1

Well, every single time I've tried to use it has been a disaster.  Even for very simple tasks, like blending soft avocado, the blender has not worked. The blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything... It's horrible.  And I even threw away my old, ugly blender when I bought this one... and the other worked just fine. :",1
1928,"Doesn't do the job. I found these nearly worthless for drying dishes.  They are not absorbent enough.  I gave these two stars only because you can use them for something besides dishes,  and because one towel in the set is a thick, loose weave that actually absorbs water",1
1929,"The carafe is defective. I purchased this item from an appliance store in my city. Though pictured here (and elsewhere) with a stainless steel carafe, it actually comes with a glass pot with a plastic black handle. The carafe has a defect and breaks easily while cleaning the inside due to pressure from a screw attaching a steel rim to the bottom of the pot. I called LG after my first pot cracked, and was told a replacement glass pot would be $56! Because it was still under warranty, they offered me a ""one-time complimentary replacement"", but I didn't receive it for over 10 weeks (and several phone calls) after that. The same cracking problem occured the first time I tried to clean the second pot (other than just rinsing with water). This time, I noticed that online the pictures seemed to show a stainless steel pot. So I called LG parts to see if I could order the stainless steel carafe, and was told that there is not such a thing. So, although the convenience of having a combo appliance was great, the hassle of replacing a defective, yet highly overpriced carafe every couple of months is not worth it. I feel that this product would be worth it if it actually DID come with a stainless steel carafe, but don't count on it",1
1930,"Heavy weight, Super sucking machine. It sure sucks everything up including carpet itself.  I'm concerned that my carpet will be paper thin in few years.

As another reviewer stated, the lid is poorly designed. Moisture boils and sprays around the outside of the lid and causes the lid to bounce around. Drives me and my dog crazy.

In fact, some of the knives that had a fair edge when I started were less sharp when I finished.  I tried several knives, using the manufacturers instructions, to no avail.  Finally, I returned the sharpener to Amazon",1
1937,"WHAT Toaster?. After shopping carefully online and off, I bought this item at JC Penney on March 25, 2006.  Penney's stated regular price is $69.99, with a sale price of $49.99, the same price Amazon is currently charging.It replaces a 10-year old Black & Decker, primarily because I read several reviews suggesting a dramatic drop in the quality of B&D small kitchen appliances and that Hamilton Beach was performing well.  I also have several other Hamilton Beach small appliances and all of them function well at what they are designed to do.  This seemed my best choice for a reasonably priced toaster oven, since I am not looking for a cheap convection oven, just an acceptable toaster large enough for baking a potato now and then or some other small item too large or the wrong shape for a slot-style toaster.  In shopping I found no current toaster ovens with a lever to press for toasting - all now have some variation of twist dial for this purpose.It is (so far) performing acceptably as an oven, though the top gets very hot.  However, only the first few uses produced acceptable toast on even the darkest toast setting.  Toast set at dark got lighter and lighter and now, only three weeks after purchase, it no longer toasts at all.  It does not darken beyond the palest coloring and toasting a second time leaves the bread only drier, not at all darker.The top elements do not seem to heat properly and do not reach the red color needed to toast bread ... or presumably to broil anything, though I haven't (and won't) use it as a broiler.  As hot as the top gets from regular oven use, I am not confident it would be safe as a broiler, even if the upper heating elements were working.At three weeks post-purchase I have no toasting capability at all.  I fully expect the rest of the oven to cease functioning soon and, regardless, it is of no practical use to me as a toaster, which is the small appliance I want and need.  I am returning it to the store and starting the search for a toaster oven over again from scratch.",1

1939,"not worth the money. Not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs, but the company also refused to provide a refund/replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing.

1940,"Doesn't toast very well. Just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back.  Even on maximum setting, it hardly toasts.  We tried different breads, different settings and it just doesn't work right.

Forget it.On the up side, the toaster looks good.  But for $80 it should toast better than my old $9.99 Black and Decker!!",1
1941,"Useless. I'd actually rate less than zero. Ads for this sweeper are very misleading.  I've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else.  It will never pick up: Tiny pieces of thread, paper, leaves, dirt, etc and these were all very tiny pieces.  You can roll the thing back and forth over these items 20 times and all it does is move them an inch or two, never pick up. The amount of time it takes to use the tiny comb they provide to clean the roller brush takes longer than getting out the vacuum to do the job over.  The handle comes in several pieces and even when assembled as instructed the handle will not stay together. It constantly falls apart and has to be put back together.  You can get around this at least by using duct tape.  Unless you have a very low pile carpet or berber, and the ONLY thing you ever have to pick up is pet hair, this Bissell product is a total waste of mone",1

I have babied this cookware and used only the correct utensils with them, and no scouring pads...only sponge and cloth as they recommend.  The non stick coating is coming off all but one...so far.  And of course foods now stick.  I don't recommend this cookware at all anymore.  I am now trying an 18/10 stainless steel set of cookware because I have had two 18/10 stainless steel pots for several years now that I LOVE.  I have not babied those at all, and they just keep going as strong as when I first got them.  I'm hoping the stainless skillets work as well as the pots that I love",1

In practice, it appears to have been designed by someone who has never actually had to use a vacuum cleaner under realistic conditions.  My kids hate using it because it is so bulky and inflexible, even though it is substantially lighter than our previous cleaner; often you have to vacuum over small ordinary bits of thread and lint many many times before the cleaner will grab them...I guess it's some consolation to know that in the meantime, it is sucking up invisible microparticles.  Forget about vacuuming under furniture ever again; the hose is held in a long inflexible cumbersome wand that prevents you from working in small spaces; the suction causes the hose to collapse upon itself.  The bagless suction is great, but it belongs in machines designed by people who have already come to grips with all the other things a decent vacuum cleaner needs to do.

I have tried emptying the containers, rolling and using the comb to clean the bottom. No luck.  It still dumps dirt on the floor at the beginning of each use.  You then have to sweep over the pile several times to get it picked up again.  The handle also has come apart but that I can live with.  The base of the unit is a large square and even though I have a large floor it would be more useful if it was smaller and more rectangular.  If you have a small kitchen floor that is not an open rectangle for cleaning the size  may be a problem.  I should probably have sent it back since it is more work to clean with it.

If you truly want nice knives but don't want to spend a fortune on good German or Japanese steel, then I recommend you try out Forschner Victorinox products.

Sure, I've gotten thread pulls and tiny little holes in other sheets, but not the knife-like cuts that appeared with these sheets, after just one kneading session. It really looked like someone had taken a pair of scissors and stabbed the sheet repeatedly. Despite the high thread count, this cotton is thin and delicate. So beware if you are a pet-owner. You do get what you pay for with these inexpensive sheets",1
1979,"Piece of Junk. Take it from a Norwegian, avoid this product at all costs if you are seeking a real krumkake iron.  It is not a solid cast iron device.  Look elsewhere for quality",1
1980,"The only Wilton product that has disappointed me thus far. I purchased this item hoping that it would make leveling and torting round cakes easier.  The &quot;blade&quot; (a simple wire) does nothing to work through a sturdier or crusty cake, and in the process of trying to get it to do so, the cake gets damaged.  I had nothing but problems with this item, and had to use my trusty bread knife to repair the damage from the leveler!  I am back to using my knife to level and torte my cakes, and feel stupid for wasting the money on this item.  My recommendation: stick with the tried and true method.  It works perfectly every time",1

When I inquired from LeCreuset, they explained that it was not an isolated incident, but rather that they had been having problems with the vendor that produced this particular item. Unless you are looking for a disposable teapot you will have to replace within 6 months, stay away from this on",1
1983,Don't buy this vacuum. I bought this vacuum several months ago and to say I was disappointed with it is putting it mildly.  I found this vacuum to be extremely noisy and dirty.  More dust is created when you empty the bagless container than is eliminated.  I HATE this vacuum to the point that I'm going out tomorrow to purchase a new one even thought this one is only a few months old.  My advise - buy something else.  I would rate this at a -5 star,1
1984,"Too Many Defects for Me. I returned the Honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed.The 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box.  The first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the High speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings.  The second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o-ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position.  The fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate.The 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier.  The design defects are somajor that the person(s) that designed and approved the design of the6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired!  The first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink.  Because of this I must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still cannot completely fill the water container to the top.The screw-on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright.The next design defect is that one cannot at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container.  One can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance, but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night.The last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just ""drop into place"" on the base.  One must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position/angle of the water container to get it to seat properly.  This is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time.I bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a Honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service.  I also selected the 6011i Humidifier because of its many desirable features.  However the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i Humidifier.  I believe   that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second, not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier.  Thus I returned the 6011i humidifier",1

Still has very good power. Bad news, it doesnt move around easy. It is like dragging an old tire around, hard to turn and direct, canister always rolls over. The only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt, and dont vacumn that often, i guess because i dread using it. I am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while. But still like i said, lots of power if you keep the filter clean",1

1992,"No Way!  Sent it Back!. I own a typical glass french press, which works great.  I was willing to try this one because of the traveling capability.  I would not purchase this again, and actually sent two back.  It may have had great insulation to keep coffee warm, but it leaked grounds into the coffee! Yuck",1
1993,"Worked somewhat well for five years with problems, then failed. The idea is great, and when this attractive mister worked, it was excellent.  However, it frequently emitted the olive oil (we never used it for anything else) in a thin stream instead of a mist.  When that happened, I tried to clean the spray valve to no avail, then suddently it would mist again.  The pump mechanism (manual) is somewhat difficult to create adequate pressure, and we suspect persons with arthritic hands would not be able to use it.  After somewhat satisfactory use for about five years, it failed completely.  So maybe we did get our money's worth all things considered.  Am now looking for a better model as a replacement",1
1994,"Cracked case. Had this grinder for 8 months.  Two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit, now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds.  I'm tossing it and getting a different brand.  All form, no function",1
1995,"A little too noisy. The unit seemed to work well, and produced a nice vapor, but we bought it for bedroom use and it was just too noisy.  It produced a high pitched whine which was uncomfortable.  I could hear it from adjacent rooms.  We tried it in the TV room where our Christmas Tree is and it worked better there but it we could still hear it so we returned the unit",1

1997,"Don't buy this one. I have this dispenser in an area where it only gets used once a day.  It takes 3 activations even at the max setting to get enough soap to wash your hands.  If you let it sit without using it for a couple days, it takes 1-2 activations before any soap at all comes out.  Performance degrades further as amount of soap in dispenser decreases.  Soap in it is Dial antibacterial.   A mechanical dispenser would work better than this",1
1998,"Battery Dies. I used to love the blender (two years ago). Fast clean up, easy set up, great for making mayo, hollandaise, whipped cream, soup... Then into hot water and soap, hit the blend and you're clean.But the battery dies and won't hold a charge. This is forseeable, but does Cuisinart offer spares/replacements at reasonable cost? Nooooooooo!Guess what? We'll buy a cheap corded model. We're disappointed. Every product has some limitations, but one should be able to use it for 3 years with no problem and replace failure-prone parts quickly, easily and at a good price, if desired.This product is just another example of bad business and we don't want to reward it",1

No.  After about 10 bottles the screw part gets dull and just pushes the cork into the bottle.

2002,"Not worth it. I bought this to simplify making fries, it was a disappointment. It takes a lot of effort to push through a potato, and when it does go through it most likely won't go straight. Either save your money and use a knife, or spend more and get a mandoline",1

2005,"Update - Okay, finally can get the handle out!. This tool works well, but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher.  When first obtained, could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon.  Now that I have had it a while, it can be removed, but it still troubles me that the handle, which does get exposed to food when using, can't be sanitized in the dishwasher.  There are other silicone spatula/spoons that have dishwasher-safe handles and I'd recommend those instead",1

2009,"Don't Get Burned--Buy the 2-Slice instead. One day my gorgeous Russell Hobbs toaster went crazy. I started to research another nice looking toaster that would also satisfy my needs for a high-tech gadget. I thought the Breville 4-Slice Toaster met my needs. I didn't want the 2-slice because I thought that there were times that I'd like to toast long slices of bread. I read the stunning reviews for the 2-Slice and the mediocre reviews for the 4-slice, and thought ""How different can they be?""Let me tell you, I bought the first Breville 4-Slice, put it on the '4' setting and ended up with charcoal. Actually, I ended up with a whole loaf of charcoal. I kept trying different slices, other kinds of bread, and even different outlets, but in the end, I figured I had a bunk toaster. However, when I exchanged the toaster for another one I had the same trouble. The toaster burned my bread everytime I used it above the '2' setting. Whats the point of having 10 settings? Finally, I exchanged the 4-slice for the 2-slice toaster. Perfection! Whoever did quality control for the 4-slice model--not so good. Buy the 2-slice and you'll be OK",1
2010,"Hard to clean. I have to agree with another reviewer.  I got one of these as a gift and I was really excited about it.  But it's a devil to keep clean.  The inner canister has a textured surface where flour gets easily trapped.  I only used it once, and now it just takes up space in my tool drawer next to my beloved measuring cups.  Great idea, really bad execution",1
2011,"Very disappointed!. I have several other pieces in this collection which I absolutely love. When I was able to find the salad server set at Amazon.com for a cheaper price, I couldn't wait to order it. When it came, I was more than disappointed. The set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished (which it is not supposed to ever do), or someone had bought it, tried to clean it with a polish (again, something that is not supposed to be done) and it wore away the finish. I also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set, and when that came, it was all scratched! Needless to say, I returned both for a full refund immediately. Obviously, the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case...and it wasn't dirt cheap to begin with, I still had paid $75.00 for it, compared to $150.00 that it is sold in stores for",1
2012,Pick a different brand!. The quality of the workmanship is awful! I didn't even get to use it - the top had chips in it and the bottom of the pestle had a huge crack that looks like it happened during the firing process,1

It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap).  However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes.  It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart.  While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months",1
2015,Don't Order This if you expect to get it. Ordered the item twice and both times it was rejected in transit by the local shipping station because it was damaged in transit.

I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice,1
2018,"The only thing getting steamed was me. There is a clear echo here, so to simply quote the experience of another reviewer, ""after two months the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead.""Rather than paying to ship the unit to Krups myself---clearly, the company cannot afford to pay shipping on the thousands of these cheaply made units---I hauled the Krups FNP112-42 down to my workshop and found that the hose to the steamer had detached.Well, fixing that problem did not render the FNP112-42 usable, for now it simply exhaled steam in great plumes like a bull in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Cleaning the unit per the directions from Krups did nothing whatsoever. Nor did shaking it robustly or inserting various instruments into the nonworking nozzles serve any purpose, but at least I felt a bit better.Turns out the only thing getting steamed was me. . .I'm going to buy a good espresso maker this year for Christmas and I can promise you that it will not have the word Krups emblazoned on it.",1

Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly",1
2025,"Death Trap for Smaller Fish!. I installed one of these in my aquarium this weekend and sat back looking forward to lush greenery in my tank.  The system is a sturdy canister in which you mix sugar, yeast, a ""stabilizing agent"" and water.  These do their thing and the gas comes through a tube down into a bubble track that makes the bubbles zig zag up, exposing them to the water for as long as possible.  Good concept and I'd read pretty good reviews.But here's the problem.  The track affixes to the wall of your tank with suction cups which create a narrow gap between the tank wall and the track.  I noticed my tetras were getting in there, but since they were getting back out I didn't worry.  Then this morning I found one of the larger females firmly stuck.  I thought she was dead until I released her.  She swam off with an ugly red mark where the thing had caught her.  I hope she's OK.  I removed this death trap from my tank and am seeking safer ways to diffuse the CO2 in my tank.The canister thing is nice, though, particularly if you're not handy enough to make an airtight seal with a DIY soda bottle system.  It might get another star for that, but seeing how it injured and could've killed one of my fish, I'd like to give it 0.UPDATE 11/30/06:  After several aquarist friends insisted that I must have improperly installed my diffuser, I tried again, this time making sure the suction cups were squeezed as flat as possible, and one of my friends checked it and assured me that this time there was just not enough space to admit even a small fish.  Two days later, I checked the diffuser and there was an otocinclus trapped behind it.  This one was dead.  Find a better way to feed your plants",1

2027,"Very disappointing. The Hoover Floormate was great the first two times we used it.  Along with the Old English it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution.  After using it twice, it had difficulty dispensing solution from the Reservoir.  This was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly.  It still got the job done.  Not too long after that it wouldn't vacuum the solution back into the unit.  I got a great clean for the price divided by four uses.  You do the math.  I'll stick to the ""cheap"" clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after I put the Floor ex-Mate into the trash.  Very disappointe",1

For the price I thought I would give them a shot so I washed them as advised by the manufactor before using. They came out of the washer and dryer as in different colors. A bad dye lot I guess.

2046,"Disappointing at best. Disappointing at bestI was truly disappointed in this item. After purchasing it we followed the directions  for conditioning the non-stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as  before each use as listed in the ""use and care guide.""It sounds simple enough. Wait for the green indicator light to come on, add the batter close but do not latch the lid. The green light will go off, when it comes back on the waffle is ready. The only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue. The waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts.We said  ""Well, OK, maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it  before they start to come out right.""  7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first.The price is great, the design is nice, the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work, at least not for us.I told my wife I would take it back to the store and exchange it. She said, ""don't you dare bring another one of those things home with you.""It's to bad too, we both love waffles.",1
2047,"Not all that great, but has a couple of nice features .... I bought this while in search of a replacement for my badly missed Bissell steam mop (which is no longer made). While the cordless feature IS great, it does a rather poor job of mopping a floor, the actual ""mop"" part is only a small velcroed microfiber cloth over a hard plastic head, which doesn't absorb any major dirt or mess. Stick vac part is ok, one bright spot was it came with a small bottle of Bissell floor cleaner (which, as it turns out IS a good product). But, I was not very impressed with this as a useful cleaning device, so back to the store it goes!",1

2050,"Great idea ... poor execution. Great idea.  It took about a week, but after a period of time my cat loved it and now won't drink much without it.  But like so many modern products, consumerism runs rampant.  Unless you spend 15 to 30 minutes every two weeks to scrub it clean, expect to buy a new one every 6 months to a year.  Mine lasted about 8 months due to being continuously filled with water and cleaned. The main issue is poor material selection and saving about a buck on the motor. First, better quality brushless motors (freely available for incorporation into the design) would work here, but would add about a buck to material costs. This shows a design decision to trade quality for more sales due to burned out motors.  This warrants a recommendation to wait as a better quality competitor will likely soon arise and knock Drinkwell off.Second, they made a design decision to use very cheap plastic that gets dirty and stains far too easily. A higher quality stain resistant plastic would also add a buck to their $40+ product.Great product ... but wait for a competitor who will do things right",1
2051,"Disappointing. I bought this model over a Cuisinart due to positive reviews here and elsewhere.  Problems however began right out of the box.The machine uses a complicated safety mechanism of levers housed within the handle of the work bowl and the work bowl cover.  These levers are not lubricated and sealed so when new I couldn't assemble the cover to the bowl or the bowl to the motor due to the stickiness of the plastic.  After I washed these parts they reluctantly slid together, the water acting as a lubricant. A few months later the handle of the bowl cracked and was replaced under warranty. Now a month after the 1 year warranty the cover is cracked and must be replaced as well at a cost of $30. These cracks are due to the design and operation of the safety mechanism so I am sure these parts will continue to break, costing me $60 a year.  This is unacceptable, especially since I only use the machine every two weeks or so.",1
2052,"Avoid this product and beware of iRobot customer service. It appears that there are fans of Roomba products however, iRobot definitely got ahead of itself with the introduction of this model.  The scheduler is a great feature although programming it is rather clumsy in its design.  The Intelli-bin feature does not live up to its name.  It does not work.  Either iRobot did not test it fully before release or it is plagued by manufacturing defects.  To make matters worse, iRobot's customer service is inexcusable.  After several emails and lengthy waits on hold, I have yet to get a replacement or any kind of resolution.  I'm given a different answer each time I contact them and I never hear back from them when promised.  My advice is save your money and avoid the frustration.  If you're still convinced you want one, wait until iRobot fixes this model and gets its act together",1

However, mine NEVER worked (and hence was never actually used, it was just taken out of the box!)The remote would beep the collar but not spray. Seller did have manufacturer send new batteries (which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation). New batteries arrived, item still didn't spray, but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer, to get a replacement, even though I responded within their advertised 30 day return policy. Please read seller information and return policies CAREFULLY! Even if you get them to take something back (only if never opened...if opened and doesn't work, they toss you to the manufacturer), there is a 25% RESTOCKING FEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pretty exorbitant and not Amazon type service I have come to expect over many years of buying from Amazon! Be very careful of sellers that are not Amazon...sometimes it isn't very clear it is not Amazon. My feedback on Seller is on feedback page and seller responded, but I don't get a chance to respond to their feedback, which gives the misconception that I actually used this product! I couldn't have used it as it didn't work! If you want to buy this, I'd recommend a reputable pet store such as Pet Smart where you can easily take an item back if it doesn't work and get a refund. Even if they are willing to replace something, you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund, which most stores have no problem with doing for you. Next time I go the established pet stores",1

When I moved into my aparment 10 years ago, my first alert smoke alarm was there already and to this day, it still works.  I only changed the alarm because of new laws.

2062,"Good as a blender, cheap canister. As a blender, this works really well. It has a lot of power and the stir stick helps knock out air bubbles and keeps things moving. The blades are well set so that I can wash it (carefully) without gloves and I've never cut myself. The lid is good and tight, although at high speeds the suction in the center works the lid right off. Once you've used it you know what blended food is, lesser blenders just mix food.The problem is the cheap aluminum metal covering below the blades in the canister peels off. How about ingesting little shards of aluminum with your food? I use mine every day but I wash it by hand with a soft sponge. I'm not rough on it, but that aluminum covering peeled and little bits found their way into my food. I realized it when I was drinking a smoothie, something hurt my tongue I and went to see where they came from. Supposedly the warranty should cover it, but I have to pay to ship it and I can't get L'Equip on the phone or by e-mail.

The vent is shaped in such a way that the mist does not go 'up' but 'sideways' and falls down. I tried taking out the vent, but then the mist would not come up out of the humidifier at all.

The new one doesn't have the digital controls, it's back to the old fashion dial for temperature setting.  If you look on their web site this fryer is no longer there.  The one that they sent me is there instead of the Dual Zone.  When the fryer worked, it did a great job, however it didn't work very long.  I will be using my new one tonight to fry some fish and french fries.  My guess is that it will work as it should, since they got rid of that stupid Dual Zone control.",1

The worst part about these spice racks is that they are NOT airtight.  Thus, many of my spices have gotten moisture from the air inside and well, they've caked up which renders this product useless.  And, with the cost of spices these days, that can be pricey.  I didn't receive any more than 5 spices with my set and they were mostly ones that I would never use.  Weird stuff like Cajun seasoning - not things you use almost every day like Cinnamon.  When you try to measure out the spices as directed, you get at least double the amount so I don't recommend just holding it over your recipe and dumping it in unmeasured.  It WILL be off.

This nutcracker does not work with smaller nuts, such as unopened pistachios (or, for those who love Japanese foods, the shells of of large ume plum seeds -- which are about the same size as a pistachio.)From the description, the design seemed like it should have worked.  There were two problems - (1) the cone is still too wide to trap and wedge smaller nuts even at the bottom and (2) range of the lever does not reach the smaller nuts when inside the cone.  Because the nuts don't wedge themselves, squeezing the handle simply moves smaller nuts inside the cone.  Because the lever doesn't reach the smaller nuts, the nuts ultimately reorient themselves until they are ""safe from harm's way.""While I could see how this item might work for a larger nut - like a large walnut, it's not why we purchased the unit.In fairness, I wouldn't have been so harsh in my one-star review here if the manufacturer's description set the proper expectation of nut sizes or types that this unit would work for",1

This  meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much.  They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands.  So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here.Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either.  My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean.  Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order.My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention.My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself.

2105,"Stopped working!!!. Stayed warm when turned off.Suddenly stopped working after 4 months (even though I hardly ever used it).Need to buy another electric burner, but don't know what company to go with",1
2106,"It would have gotten 5 stars, but... This is a great sponge brush - for right-handed people!  The sponge twists off when you use it in a counter-clockwise direction, as lefties are apt to do, so I really can't use it.The description says that all you have to do to refill it is to twist the sponge.  That's true, but to actually get more detergent into the handle, you also have to remove the sponge.  So once you twist it, it comes away from the handle. For lefties like me this means a waste of time and detergent as well as a lot of annoyance.I emailed Oxo about this a month or so ago and never even received an acknowledgement.  It's not an expensive item, so I'm ok with having spent the money, but I am very disappointed in Oxo's lack of response.So if you're right-handed, go for it.  It's a nice kitchen tool.  If you're a lefty, keep looking!I emailed Oxo recently and - after a second try - got a response that the item has been retooled.  I'll update this review again after I use it",1
2107,"Holes Too Small. I've used this colander for close to two years, and am sort of surprised by the positive comments on Amazon here.  I regularly use it for noodles, stuffed pastas, and more.  I'm now looking for a new colander because the holes to drain the water are just too small, so bits of food tend to get stuck in them, and then it's almost impossible to clean.  Sure it works, but the maintenance is too much for me",1
2108,"Canister and Filter are Messy to Empty!. Do not buy this vacuum if you have a pet.  Cleaning out the canister is a very MESSY job and the dirt and pet hair stick all over the filter.  Replacement filters are difficult to find and must be ordered on-line.  I've put up with this vacuum for a year and I'm now buying a new BAGGED vacuum.  I've put up with it this long because it is very lightweight, it has a nice retractable handle, and you can set it to ""suction only"" and use it on bare floors.  But cleaning out the dirt and pet hair is messy, messy, messy",1
2109,"Disappointment for an organization freak. The organizer is well made and matched my cabinets and drawers perfectly. However, most of the compartments are stationary, only a few of the pieces are adjustable. I did not have the desired freedom that I imagined when purchasing the product. There is nothing wrong with the organizer itself but it is not as adjustable as I would have liked",1
2110,"Table is incomplete. We ordered this table twice and both times it shipped with out a base.  Amazon assured us the table would be complete the second time we ordered it, but we still ended up with a top and no base.  We were told the shippment from The Carolina Table and Chair company was to blame and the table would be pulled from Amazon until they got the complete table.  It is still on the web site and I suspect it is still incomplete",1
2111,"Very Dissapointed!!!. I waited along time to buy this coffee maker...after it finally went on sale I went and made the plunge and bought it.  I was so excited when I finally got it, but boy...was I wrong.  It is very complicated to get it programed.  It was very unclear...also there are too many parts to it and too hard to clean.  The most dissapointing part was the thermal caraf.  It took at least about 30 seconds for a full cup to be poured...it was so slow.  There is no adjustment to the lid.  What a waste of time and money.  I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought it",1
2112,The worst vacuum I have ever used. I just use it on hardwood and tile and it still doesn't pick up cat hair - basically it's a very noisy fake vacuum cleaner. The suction   on it after 2 months of light use is about the same as a very soft breeze,1
2113,"Defective Coffeemakers. I purchased this item because of the good inital reviews however, I have just received my replacement coffeemaker and it has the same problem as the first one I received.Look at the picture of the Coffeemaker. Do you see the metal plate that covers the buttons? That plate slides down and makes the buttons stick. You are unable to turn the coffeemaker on/off, press the up/down & timer buttons because of it.Additionally, the original coffeemaker failed to make coffee as programmed about every other time it was set?I would steer clear of this item. It's great when you can get it to work but because of the obvious engineering defects (see other reviews with the same problem)it is more of a hassle than it's worth; especially at the current price.I guess all the time and effort into getting a coffeemaker to tell the weather made the designers forget about basic functionality",1
2114,"This pot is a bust. Our Krups 199 was a wedding gift two years ago.  We loved it--until this morning.  See the ""2 consumer photos"" linked above?  That's my coffee pot.  It's the same story you've read from the other six people.  I contacted Krups and they informed me the Krups carafe in this machine is particularly delicate--you aren't to even use a sponge to clean it! I was told to wipe it out with a cloth.  Gross.  Suffice to say, if you don't like your fresh coffee to taste like moldy, stale coffee, go spend your money on another machine and carafe.",1

Bought this as a Xmas present for my child and we used it a couple of times...loved the idea...cute concept, worked with just ice cubes...easy to use and loved the idea that it had the snow cone holder built right in....BUT...we kept getting little white shards of plastic in our snow cones...I cleaned the machine out twice, and tried again...still plastic shards...called the manufacturer...no response at all.  I wanted to love this machine...it had all the makings of a success, and had the manufacturer responded, I might have even tried another to see if I had just gotten a lemon...but no response, thru email or phone.  Now I am trying to find another one, by a different manufacturer, that won't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth...from poor customer service OR white shaved pieces of plastic",1

2117,"Use a Roomba instead :-). I bought this attachment after discovering that the base of my new Dyson vacuum stood too high off the floor to be used under and around furniture. The attachment cleans as promised, but I have decided that using it is more trouble than it's worth.The attachment connects to the wand (not to the base), which requires a several step process to use it, back and forth, as you clean the floors. It is bulky (12"" x 10.5"" x 7"") and there's no built-in place to store it on the vacuum, so it's taking up a lot of shelf space in my cleaning closet (and I have to carry it around with me from room to room, as I clean.)Dyson makes a great vacuum, with especially brilliant design features - it's disappointing that the standard vacuum doesn't allow for under-furniture cleaning, which should be a basic.  And this attachment doesn't really make up for it.After using the floor-tool attachment a few times, I decided to rely upon my Roomba, instead, for the areas that the Dyson (without attachment) can't cover - the Roomba does a much better job of going around chair legs, etc., and I don't have to be there!If I had it to do over, I wouldn't have purchased this item - put your $$ toward a robot cleaner. :-)",1
2118,"Didn't like at all!. The can opener does not swing tight and once installed, kept swinging out instead of staying stowed. I bought it because it was so highly rated, but I am very disappointed. There is no magnet to hold the can lid either. Although it was intended to save space, it is kind of a clunky eyesore",1
2119,WORST TOASTER EVER!!!. This is my second Cuisinart toaster. I must say they didn't make a big fuss when I called and said that the first one kicked the bucket. They sent another one in the mail. I thought just maybe it was THAT toaster. I was wrong we've had the new one for about two months now and the toast is getting more burnt on one side and the other isn't even brown. The last one did the same thing and then one side quit working. I don't recomend this product. It's ashame that a company like cuisinart with such a good reputation can't make a toaster that actually works,1
2120,"zero stars, really!. Like the other reviewers, I was impressed by this skillet...until I used it!  This should be taken off the market so no one else has to waste their time!  How this passed any tests is beyond me!  It does heat unevenly, sticks, etc...  e.g., to cook bacon, one should start with cold skillet, but for this skillet you are supposed to heat the skillet for 15 min. with the lid on first!  Even holding heat is unpredictable.  It is just terrible!  They should be ashamed, and really, Amazon should not carry this except for the fact that we can warn others about it via this form",1

2126,"Poor Quality.  Save Your Money!!!!!. I wish I had read some of the reviews for this product before I bought it.  I was SO disappointed with the quality of the product. The sheets are extremely rough, thin and scratchy. The comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one. Since Thomas the Tank Engine is such a popular character, I would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing  it's trademark. As such, I am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding",1
2127,"Nice while it lasted... As with the reviewer above, I purchased this fan from another store and it worked well at first.  The remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well.  However within 4 months of owning it, when we tried to have it rotate, it turns slightly, gets stuck, and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating.  Needless to say it no longer rotates, so it is now just a stationary fan.  I even tried taking it apart to unjam it, but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem, so without new parts it could not be fixed.  Buy another fan if you want it to last, I know I am.",1
2128,"Warm, but not toasty. The Sharp Warm and Toasty microwave is a clunky hybrid of toaster and microwave. It takes 10 minutes to toast a muffin. The software is buggy-- I can't program it to toast a muffin to the end, but must get up and re-start half way though. The interface is clunky--it has little relationship to most appliance interface design, so must keep manual handy.Plus, ours JUST DIED died, after only 2 1/2 years of moderate use.The user manual has no troubleshooting section. (Like nothing will ever go wrong). Neither does their Website. So I tried to contact Sharp through their Website and after filling out all my info and problem details, found their site doesn't work with Firefox. The end.",1

I placed them on a cookie sheet and made a batch of cookies- While they were baking- my smoke detector went off- there wasn't any smoke that I could ""see"" but it set it off. When I opened the oven there was some smoke- but I thought perhaps it was some baked over food. The cookies took longer to bake by 2-3minutes. They also had a strange taste to them- sort of like plastic.I later tried using these again- but put breaded fish on them and in a 350deg oven- within minutes of the oven coming to temp. smoke was pouring out of the oven- I had to take the whole pan and food out onto the porch as it was very toxic smelling and smoke everywhere!!I would not recommend these to ANYONE and I am going to try contacting the company with my problem.Hope this review helps",1
2131,"This fan will cook you at night.... The fan works well as long as you do not use the temperature control feature.  The biggest flaw is its design.  It does not measure the room's temperature.  Scenario:  You set it to 65 degrees (lowest setting), it is 75 inside of the room and 60 outside.  The fan will not kick in, because it is outside below 65 degrees.  Bummer!!!  We live at 4000 feet, it gets hot in the daytime, and below 65 at night time.  Keeping the fan at permanent blow will make us freeze in the morning.  Setting the auto temperature setting will make us cook.  I've opened up the machine to see where the sensor is.  It has no connection to the inside of the room, and only measures the temperature of the wind it sucks through.  Poor design, go buy another brand",1

It is now mid-March and the motor has already burned up.

2135,"Borderline dangerous. I have four 16-piece sets that I received for my wedding.  They are beautiful plates, but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave, going through the dishwasher or serving hot food.Within 3 months, several plates cracked down the middle, making them unusable.  A large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added.  I did a search on www.epinions.com and found I wasn't the only person having these problems.  EVERYONE is having these problems.Plus, it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces.  You have to buy another set.  What a racket.  The clincher is that they are located in Indonesia, so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent.  I've gotten nothing but the international run-around",1
2136,"A Dud!!!!. I remodeled my kitchen and purchased a ceramic stove top and was no longer able to use my cast iron gridle to make my tortillas, so I was looking for something I could continue making them.  I finally came across this grill which stated that you could make tortillas on.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   It does not work, it does not get hot enough.  If you want to eat a raw tortilla, then it works fine.  I called Bethany Housewares in Cresco, Iowa and spoke to a Lynn Sorenson, who identified herself as the owner.  She was a very rude person and does care about customer satisfaction.  She stated that since I had used the grill that I could not get a refund.  I stated to her that I could not tell if it worked by looking at it.  She then went on to state ""if you buy clothes at a store and wear them you can't return them.""  That statement does not make any sense.  I am going to attempt to get this matter resolved through Amazon.  If they can't help I will be out one hundred dollars.  Their product is overpriced but I thought that if it worked, it would be worth the money.  What is wrong with this world.  Most people just care about the all mightly dollar.  I will make sure when I order a kitchenware or appliance again that it is not from Kitchen Kraft doing business as Bethany Housewares again!!!!!! BOILING IN ARIZONA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
2137,Worst customer service experienced via a product purchased on Amazon. I purchased this product based on the features and the fact it has a one year warranty.  After 6 months is stopped working.  Calling DeLonghi they said they would replace it.  The next week they said no and told me to take it to a repair center they authorized that was out of town.  Took it to the repair center and one week later they said it could not be fixed and DeLonghi was sending a new one.  One week later I called DeLonghi and they said they never told the repair center they would replace.  Instead they would send parts in 'a few weeks.'  8 weeks since the oven stopped working and I still do not know when or if I will ever get it back.  Amazon should black-list DeLonghi as a vendor due to horrific customer service,1
2138,"Looks cool, kept me sort of cool...too bad it broke so quickly. Bought this to cool my office desk.  I would say it provided a very gentle breeze.  I didn't mind that, I do not like being blasted with a shock of air anyway.  But almost exactly three months after  I bought it, the cheap plastic shaft broke.  I suppose I could try to fix it, the motor seems OK, but it is just not good enough to warrant the effort.  One star for good looks",1
2139,"I wasted my money. There is a flat-out lie on the side of this box.  It reads, ""Available in 3 sizes to easily accommodate any size aquatic turtle.""  I have two red ear sliders, probably the most common of all aquatic turtle pets, and they are large so I bought the largest size of this Turtle Dock.  Forget my big turtle, who didn't even try to climb on this thing...The SMALLER of my two turtles sunk this; he probably weighs in at 3 or 4 pounds.  He certainly doesn't look any larger than the turle they show on the box, yet when he climbs on it, the whole floating thing submerges so that half his body is under water.  The same rods mechanism that allows it to float at any water level and keeps it connected to the side of the tank also lets the thing sink if your turtle is too heavy for it, which proves the other lie on the box, that it ""Allows aquatic turtles a dry basking area...""  I am very disappointed in this product and unless your turtles are under a pound in weight I don't think it works, despite their promise that is accommodates any size aquatic turtle.  And because I tried it, now I can't return it to the Amazon Merchant.  Thanks a lot, Zoo Med",1

What you cannot see from the photo is that it is held together with PLASTIC parts that allegedly ""snap"" together, but they simply don't stay together.  You will need a large empty room & 2 people & still you won't ever get it together.  I bought it for use in a closet, but it's impossible to move it into the closet because it falls apart every time we attempt to move it.  So, you can imagine that it can only hold VERY light items.  Since it's ugly, I can't imagine any other use for it BUT the closet.  But it's ugliness is not the main problem, which is, that it is simply UNUSABLE",1

However, we have a large family and put it in the dishwasher regularly. It has been 5 years and this cookware has not stood up to regular use. Do not mistake Kitchen Essentials for professional cookware.  Now when we cook mashed potatoes, we do not know if the potatoes were peppered or just the flaking Teflon. All of the pieces used daily are now un-coated aluminum. The outside of the cookware is chalky in appearance.  I am sure this is from the dishwasher.  We used plastic utensils most of the time, but you know how it is when you are in a hurry to feed to kids.  My recommendation is to spend the money on high quality stainless steel cookware. We have recently purchased Calphalon tri-ply and so far we are really pleased. The stainless steel cleans up easily, or at least as easy as the Kitchen Essentials. For the money, go stainless and you will never have to purchase cookware again.",1

Another reviewer mentioned that he doesn't use the timer.Having used oil-filled heaters (usually great) in the past I was hoping that the Solaris with a timer would be the ultimate gentle heater.Unfortunately, the timer is nearly impossible to use. It is on the side and the only way to adjust the timer is to lift the whole unit- hot or cold, or get down on your hands and knees. The timer is 7"" above the floor. Because there is no manual override, which is unbelievable, for occasional use it is necessary to adjust the entire timer- over, and over again. That's means pushing up or down 96 fragile little plastic pins.  The timer is obsolete.After closer review of other heaters I believe there are better products out there",1
2146,"It's too small. The description is wrong for this product. I thought it was going to be a regular sized pie dish, but deeper. It looks like it would make a ""personal pie"".

I've gone through at least 6 sets of refills this winter season already, and the results are consistent.  I run the Vornado humidifier 24/7, as recommended by the manufacturer and clean it regularly, especially when changing out the wicks.  There is never any gunky build-up to blame the short life-span on.  These are clearly manufactured to last only two weeks.  My ancient Duracraft, which is no longer manufactured, but is the best humidifier I've ever had, easily goes 4 to 6 weeks between wick filter changes, with no deterioration in performance.  This will be the last year I use the Vornado...for next year I'll be purchasing a second Air-o-Swiss, which runs like a dream, but is quite pricey up front",1

I purchased this item last May, and although at first I was thrilled to have an automatic litter box, I soon realized that it was very noisy, difficult to clean (container holder is flimsy, gaps between holder and box mean litter spills out the side & underneath. To cut down on the mess, I purchased the tent to keep the litter inside.  Very bad idea!  Tent is flimsy, ripped upon assembly & makes it extremely difficult to empty box.  It seemed I was spending as much time maintaining this box as I was a regular litter box.I was just about to order replacement cartridges (which don't really snap shut, by the way, when you go to take them out) when I decided to see what else is out there in the world of automatic litterboxes.  I purchased a Purrforma jumbo box, and, so far, it is wonderful.  It is sturdy, has a huge hood that you just lift off, is so quiet that it doesn't need a sleep timer like the littermaid one.  It is well thought out and I would urge anyone to spend the extra dollars to get it, it's a small price to pay for your sanity",1

I bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great... that is until it started leaking about 4 months after I bought it.

Yup, a leak. The tank was full yesterday and this morning it's 2/3's full, with a pool of water on the table that holds it.  Luckily, no damage was done to the floor either time.I understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then,  but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time, well then, it's just a cruddy product.Stay away from this aquarium",1
2158,"Rotten little finger-slicer. The professional ""review"" is a puff-piece. This is a horrible piece of kitchen equipment. It is a flimsy piece of plastic and a danger to the cook.There is no built-in holder for the blades. These, inevitably, float aound your kitchen cupboards and, just as inevitably, get lost. And, if you have never scrambled around in a drawer for a razor-sharp metal hedgehog, you have still have a treat in store for you.The finger-guard is a travesty. It is flat, small piece of plastic. It cannot be attached to the machine, so it will get lost too. Your fingers run very close to the blades when cutting. One mis-slice and you can cut a deep little pocket in your finger.The blades are badly designed and catch and tear, rather than slice, your food. They are small, easily lost and fall out when you are cutting.(As I did. Coulda studded it with garlic and baked it, but seeing the bone in my finger turned me off meat for a while. Sorry folks, a description of the taste of long pig will have to wait awhile.)The blades are attached with a small, badly designed screw which you have to tighten HARD with your fingers a few mm from the blades. Same problem when you remove a blade.And it has a ridiculously high price. You can get better mandolines right here at Amazon at a much lower price. Also MUCH better mandolins at somewhat higher prices.Take my advice: If you don't cook enough to be very handy with knivies, then a mandolin (despite ""finger guards"" and the like) are dangerous.

I called, they don't know what I am talking about (even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual), or if I get a rep who does know what the piece is, they say they don't have one to sell, but if I want to pay to ship the unit back and forth,they will replace it. I have left voice mail messages for non-existent supervisors. So, instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece, I will return this to the store as defective and get the money back.

They warn you not to attempt to move it unless you remove both water tanks(so why have 4 wheels?).  I believe them because nothing is fastened and it would fall apart if bumped. They call it an 11 gallon unit, but, that means it may be able to put that much in the air in 24 hours.  They fail to tell you that you will have to refill the 2 water tanks, about five times each, to do this.  It can only be used on level floors that are water resistant, so that eliminates 95% of my house as wall to wall carpet and hardwood floors are normal in many homes.  Before you can use the unit you have to soak the filter and they suggest you do this each time you fill the water tanks.",1

It is an inefficient and wasteful way to store a modest number of knives.If I keep this item (returning it will result in shipping charges and a small refund), I'll use just the small tray and toss Moby Dick.It looked useful in the picture, but in real life, it is no match for other types of knife holders, and I shall spend the money to get a really nice wooden one instead",1

The fastest speed on this fan is the slowest speed on all the other fans I've owned! I can barely feel it when I'm lying in bed. And the slowest speed is just a joke!

The hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you ""need"", so you're kind of SOL when the crappy aluminum cams break. I'm sure they'd send some more if I asked, but for now my piece is hanging out, half way assembled because I'm scared of breaking any more of the hardware. Either way, I think I'm going to ditch the cam/bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up.The instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web.

It vaccuums dust and sand- if you go over it twice. It does NOT vaccuum Kix, Cheerios, Goldfish, dried Play-Doh, corners, under low clearance furniture, along edges of walls or cabinets... I was so disappointed. I usually use a Shop Vac with a wide brush floor attachment. I wanted something that would do 2 jobs at once and save me time. It took me twice as long to vaccuum. If an object is too large to suck up you are out of luck. Here is why...*The debris on the floor has to be able to fit in the same narrow opening that sucks up the water.*The rubber edging is set too low to the floor and pushes or flings larger objects ahead of it. If you go over it backwards you hit the first problem stated above.*The suction is not great enough to pull debris from edges and corners.In addition, the water and dry dirt end up in the same container unless you wish to clean out the container twice. The filters clog easily if you have pets. The fluid runs out quickly. The brushes are weak and ineffectual on thicker grime and spots, a hidden jelly stain or a drop of congealed juice for example. I did notice that the water method sucked up more dirt then the intended dry method. It does clean, I had dirty water as proof, but this product leaves too much behind. I was very bummed and it was a hassle to return because I live 25 miles from the store. I wish that I had accepted the negative reviews. I hope other readers will learn from me and not the hard way like I did! There really is no better way than a broom or a good cannister vaccuum to get dirt and there is a reason that the mop is still #1 after all this time!",1

The AL has a little circular whisk on the bottom.  The MM has a dime-sized disc with 16 little teeth @ a 45 degree angle to the disk. Surprisingly, the MM frother disc generates less drag in liquid and spins faster than the AE.  I believe the MM actually does a BETTER job.  It frothes like hell.

2227,"Defective. I received this coffeemaker for Christmas.  After two months of use, it quit working. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they sent me something to clean my coffeemaker.  It still did not work so I contacted Hamilton Beach again.  Now I have to cut off my appliance cord and send it back to them along with $6 to get a new cord.  Since it wasn't my fault, why should it cost me anything to get my coffeemaker restored.  Stay away from Hamilton Beach products",1
2228,"Didn't fit, low quality. Most of the time I get a good deal shopping for bargains on Amazon, but this wasn't one of those times.  The sheets were mediocre quality.  That would've been fine had they fit properly, but they were exceptionally baggy and the elastic was weak.  Waste of my money",1
2229,The knife from hell. I purchased this knife and was twice sent the wrong knife.  I returned the first wrong knife and was sent a second wrong knife.  When I returned the second knife I got conflicting e-mails.  One said I would be receiving the correct knife and the second said I was being issued a refund.  I waited and received neither.  I had to call twice to finally get by money refunded.  I would have liked to receive the knife I ordered.  I think Amazon owes me the knife for all the inconvenience I was put through.  Thank you,1
2230,"Disappointed. I bought this knife for $35.00 at linens and things. I vacillated between this and the $80 version. I made a mistake. When the knife was finally extricated from it's mega-vinyl prison. I hefted it, felt the edge and examined construction. I got less than I paid for.  The feel and look of this knife is similar to those late night TV special knives. ""But wait, there's more... Now how much would you pay?""It is just a cheap feeling product. Also, the tip of the knife had a pronounced burr on it that I had to hone off.I am too old to be re-learning that you get what you pay for.",1
2231,Not Happy. This mattress is very very hard. I have tried many memory foam mattresses in the retail shops and expected something similar. It is not. I slept on it for 13 days until I gave up. They charge a 20% restocking fee and the shipping is outrageous so returning it is out of the question. It comes vacuumed packed from the factory. How are we supposed to return it when no one will ship it after it is opened?? It now lies (sleeping peacefully) in my daughter's abandoned bedroom,1
2232,"I was very disappointed in this product. The second time we used the meat fork, the handle snapped off",1
2233,"Awkward. This wok is heavy and unbalanced - it can tip while on the element.The long handle is thick and uncomfortable, and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok.  Lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task.The flat bottom isn't wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir-frying.  If I wanted to saut, I'd have gotten a saut pan.The lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere.  You need lots of counter space.As well, this wok just isn't large enough for stir-frying for more than two people",1
2234,"No base and broken when delivered. I, too, received this table with no base. Not only that, there was inadequate packing materials and the table top was cracked and falling apart as a result. Why doesn't Amazon pull this? Too bad, because it would have been a nice piece if company knew how to ship properly.",1

2236,"Two thumbs down. Please read David Maces's review. I bought mine about two years ago and just today the plastic part mentioned by Mr. Mace failed. A sturdy, sleek can opener is now going to the trash permaturely because Hamilton Beach does not provide a replacement part",1
2237,Very Difficult. I bought this ready to do a lot of things with it. I haven't been able to sew one thing. You have to use it with the laptop at all times or it will complain with an annoying beep again and again. I tried to sew a light material curtain with it the needle poked at the bobbin holder and now I can never use it again. I have to get it repaired because I am unable to find a replacement part for it where I have looked. Offers a lot of options and I am sure once its repaired if ever I will eventually get to sew one thing,1
2238,Worst can opener I have ever owned!!!. Bought this to replace a cheap Rivan can opener that had a broken lid-retaining magnet. Biggest mistake. It routinely drops cans - even light ones like soup and mushrooms. Difficult to attach the can to it - and even harder to clean. Aviod this model at all costs,1
2239,over priced plastic leaking doesn't keep coffee hot JUNK. No stars is what this should be. Where do I start???  The machine brews the coffee everywhere but into the caraffe.  You will have coffee grinds and water all over your counter if you don't position the caraffe in the exact spot it needs to be (so forget setting the timer for the a.m. or you will be needing your mop).  The so called thermal caraffe is junk.  Plan on a refill 15 minutes after your first cup?  You'll have to nuke it as the thermal caraffe does not keep coffee warm at all.  You know those little holes that the coffee pours into during brewing...I think it lets the heat out as well.  This is the WORST coffee machine I have ever owned and it is the most expensive one I have ever owned.  I'm going back to the nine ninety nine specials.  At least they work,1

2241,"Mediocre in every way. This was a seventh anniversaty gift, and being made of copper is its only real benefit.  Two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it's light and relatively shabby in construction.It's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper, and to that end, this fit the bill.  But its real value, even for the intended purpose, is very limited",1
2242,"insane, dope smoking engineers designed this. Had the original Toshiba until it died ; no longer is that one made. We  bought the ugly round Cuisinart, which lasted for 5 years until it just quit working. Way too expensive to pack it up for repair, so we decided to try this attractive chrome job :(it is difficult to clean, often drips and  is altogether  unreliable. Because it has a thermal carafe, I expected it to keep coffee hot for more than one hour, but no luck. So I have to force open the lid right after brewing (apparently is gets vapor lock) and transfer contents to another thermos. I am on the prowl for another grind and brew (probably a Melitta)and ran across this opportunity to review this ill designed  Cuisinart, so decided to save some other folks the grief we have had with it. Only get one if somebody promises to pay you to use it",1
2243,"Negative Stars Would be More Honest. I was desperate for a warm moisture humidifier and, despite the bad reviews, went ahead and bought this one.  What a mistake.  After working fine for a couple of weeks, the contacts became sensitive, and I had to play with it a bit to get it to work.  That worked fine for another couple of weeks.  Then it exploded all over my wooden floors.  I think that amazon should be held accountable for selling a product that is so obviously flawed and which they have perfectly good reason to know is flawed.  Enough people have told them that it is",1

If I am using it incorrectly, I am unable to figure it out.  Unfortunately, I discarded the shipping package which I recycled as usual.  If I can obtain packaging for this disappointing tool, I will return it post-haste to Amazon.",1

I used it to grind chicken, and was happy to see it working, until I noticed the chicken had a gray color to it on certain parts.  It turns out the coating of metal on the grinder was actually rubbing off and getting on both the food being grinded and the ground up chicken.  Making baby food at home is supposed to be healthy, but I beleive feeding your child metal is not considered part of their iron requirements",1
2247,Dissappointed. I really wanted this set and this was the only site that I was able to find it.  My shippment was received shattered because no padding was included in the box.  I was sent two replacements after that with no padding and they were shattered also.  I have finally given up and accepted a refund,1
2248,"Hot- in a bad way. Wish I had read some of the reviews before I bought this-  They are right, what a piece of junk!!!!  The unit does get quite hot after very little use and blows hot air all the while.  The hose is awkward and there are no small attachments to allow you to get into small spaces.  VERY LOUD too.  Shoulder strap is useless since you have to get on your hands and knees to use the vac or the hose.  Filter is a pain to clean every time (who needs the bother and mess) and the dirt cup holds very little.  Don't waste your money",1

This was tolerable since the coffee it made was decent. Then, about 2 months after I bought the unit, it stopped working altogether. The ""on"" light would illuminate, but nothing would happen. I only use this pot once a day, hardly heavy use, this shouldn't have happened.",1

I have ordered Lenox Tuscany Classics, or had them ordered for me from my wish list, on Amazon many times. In fact, I've ordered all sorts of wine glasses on Amazon and never had a problem. Last week, however, I decided to order these Grand Beaujolais glasses as a birthday gift for a friend. The glasses never reached my house because UPS reported them damaged in shipment. Amazon kindly offered to send a replacement and upgrade free to 2-day shipping. Once again, UPS reported them damaged in shipment. Amazon very kindly gave me a full refund at this point so that I could purchase the glasses locally in time for my friend's birthday.I have had a great experience, overall, ordering glassware from Amazon and will order glasses from them in the future, but there seems to be a shipping issue with these glasses in particular.",1

I do regret buying this grinder. It is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10. My main complaint is that it is messy. The grounds stick to the sides and bottom and I have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out. I am tempted to purchase another Krups before I break this one by beating the grounds out of it. Also, coffee grounds are EVERYWHERE, I always have to use a cloth to clean up. Not a good buy",1

The heavy parts don't fit together well, and the juicer is wobbly and unstable, despite it's heaviness.  I am sending this back without using it once, becuase there's no way to adjust the parts, and it's too unstable to use as is.  Also, it really is almost impossible to pick up and move, due to the weight, without straining your back.  Finally, like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer, I find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant, and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places.  It seem like the kind of company where to get a good product, you'd have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one",1

A large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added.  I did a search on www.epinions.com and found I wasn't the only person having these problems.  EVERYONE is having these problems.Plus, it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces.  You have to buy another set.  What a racket.

The suction was initially great and at first use I thought it was broken until I discovered that the trap was full (duh).  That had me sold but after the last time I cleaned it out, it just died.  I'm no dummy with fixing things but that is why I bought a ""good"" vacuum.  Well, $200 in the trash",1
2280,Not powerful enough and too tall!. This blender comes with the battery unit that sits on top of the removable motor which sits on top of the blender shaft. This makes the unit entirely too tall to apply the proper pressure and very uncomfortable to maneuver while on the stove or counter.

What you are buying is a cardboard box that holds the disposable litter tray cartridge that you must buy for the ""Automated System"" to work.  Urine will soak through the bottom of the cardboard tray within 2 days and I have 1 cat! The company wants you to stir the litter around every day so the cat urine will soak up in the crystals. I bought this ""Automated System"" so I didnt have to tend to a litter box every day. I tried stiring the litter every day and urine still soaked through the bottom of the cardboard litter tray.  How pathetic! Maybe the system might be a little better if the trays were made out of plastic rather than cardboard??  Avoid this system all together",1

Oh well, live and learn",1
2288,"Nice Name Poor Performance. I recently purchased the NEW Waring juice simply because I knew the name and quality of products they typically produce.This juicer does have a larger feed chute which makes juicing easier but there are these three metal bars inside to prevent people from sticking their hand in machine. These bars obviously are there for safety but caused my food push to get stuck in the machine while juicing spinach and created a suction action. I had to wiggle and use EXTREME force to extract the food push from the machine.I also tried to juice pineapple and green apples, two of my favorites but the machine over heated. I had to follow the instructions in the manual that covered overheating throughly, now I know why they devoted so much time to overheating as this happened twice with me. I could only proceed after unplugging the machine and waiting 5 minutes with no luck, and then after ten minutes I was ready to go again.Also noticed that the pulp container had large pieces of apple skin about the size of a fifty cent piece that was not juiced.  The food chute is justified to one side and also caused all the residue in the filter to collect on one side, so the longer I juiced the less juice it yeilded.The machine had two speeds, at last but never stated how many rotations per minute occured while on high or low.Overall disappointing",1
2289,"My Real Rating is 0 Stars. If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product",1
2290,"lack of instructions. I found it very awkward trying to stabilize the pump with one hand, and pull the pump up  and down to get the air out.Also I can not get the top out of the decanter. It seems stuck there.As a result, I can not say if it does what you claim",1
2291,"Underpowered, leaves sharp edge on can, slow. I was expecting a device that cut the roll-seam of the lid, but this one cuts the can just below the lid.  The resulting edge, while not razor sharp, is hazardous--in point of fact, the instructions warn, ""Note: The cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care."" contradicting the prominent ""NO SHARP EDGES"" claim on the packaging.On a typical can, the opener struggles to complete its task, coming to a near stop at times.  Of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life.  It has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical  303 can about 1-1/2 times.  For large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around.When the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can, there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can. There is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point, but if the reverse button doesn't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed, you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can--this manual release operation is challenging (and generally messy) to perform .The cutter--a sharp edged wheel--is not removable for cleaning, so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth (after removing the batteries).I recommend passing up this gadget",1

I went to Petsmart in person and they didn't have these filters that I need. So I ordered these. I ended up not getting them until the middle of November. that's over a month!!!! I called customer service for Petsmart and the only thing they told me was they would cancel the order and I could go get them from the store. Basic they did absolutly nothing. I would not recommend ordering from Petsmart unless you don't need what you're ordering for a couple of months.,1

I was quite disappointed when I opened the package only to find it was a typical pop-up hamper I could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run I ended up paying more for it.  I wanted to buy a pop-up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed.  This hamper lacks a lid so I reccomend if you're looking for the same thing not to buy it.  If I had known it lacked a lid I would not have purchased the hamper.  It's partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product.  I gave it two stars because it's still functional and sturdy,1
2297,"Run of the mill Colander. It was ok, but not grate. I found a better one on E bay and threw this one in the trash. It colandered the food ok, but did nothing to add excitement to my life. The antique one I found on E bay simply turned my life around in the kitchen. Now I'm cooking like a dream and gaining lots of weight. On the serious side, it was a little small and awfully shiny. It was a little deep compared to the width. It drained the spaghetti ok and I used it for vegetables.",1
2298,"Near worthless for candy. This thermometer gives completely inaccurate readings unless you have at least the first 1.5 inches in the food.  If any part of that sensor area is exposed to air, the reading will be way low.So, if you're using it for something like peanut brittle or fudge, chances are, your boiling liquids won't be deep enough to get accurate readings.However, it's a fairly sturdy device and reads very quickly so would probably be great for deep fat frying and meats",1
2299,"Skin is still dry. I moved out to LA from NY and there is considerable less amount of humidity in LA.My skin was drying up. So I asked and was recommended this humidifier.Unfortunately it did nothing to alleviate my dry skin. I blasted it on high and still nothing.The filter seems to run out pretty quickly. The product seems very fragile. The material is cheap and the water tank doesn't fit properly into the product, so that moving it even it a little causes water to leak.The plus side was that it was easy to assemble and it was cheap",1
2300,Beautiful and broke. I can't believe the way Amazon packed these dishes. They were thrown in a box with virtually no padding. So of course several of the plates were cracked. They are cute. I have asked them to send me another set and hopefully they will ship them better.One thing I did notice -- the description says dishwasher/microwave safe but the dishes don't have that stamped on the bottom. I am also hoping they abide by our laws regarding lead free but you never know now a days what comes from china.,1
2301,"Not worth the money I paid!. Baring the Calphalon name I was expecting something really nice, especially for the price I paid through Amazon of $84.95 - boy was I disappointed. Although Amazon is selling it as high-quality piece the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid is clearly on the cheaper side of the Calphalon brand. It looks like one of the pans Calphalon gives away to get you to purchase their higher end cookware. The item arrived nicely boxed in the Calphalon box but when I opened the box the pan looked like it had originally been a Return item before it was sent to me - The pot and lid were both in orginal packaging but the lid was clearly broken. It looked like someone had taken a hammer to it and stuck it back in the box and sent it on to me. Amazon has agreed to send a replacement at no charge but I can't believe they would have sent something like this to me to begin with without first inspecting what they send out. Unless it's being given to you as a ""freebie"" I suggest you save your money.",1
2302,Find another blanket. I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.,1
2303,"You are buying rubbing alcohol!. Look up the ingredients yourself.  I foolishly bought this for my bikini line, because what good is hair removal if it is replaced by bumps?  But, after I got it and used it (it did work a little) I noticed that it is mostly alcohol, a little aspirin, another ingredient common in any moisturizer and then Propylene Glycol...which is the main ingredient in antifreeze.  Save yourself some money and go buy a 50 cent bottle of rubbing alcohol....I did, and it works just as well",1

I had only used it a maximum of 7 times when I noticed that there was a spot that seemed to be stuck on the surface of the pan. I looked more closely and discovered that there was about a 2"" square area where the nonstick coating had just rubbed off. I have always been very careful with the way I handle this skillet (no metal utensils, hand wash, no excessive heat.)I bought it at a really good sale price, but I think that I should have been able to get more than 7 uses before it destroyed the cooking surface",1
2307,"Poor exterior finish. Even though I am very careful with how I use and store my pots and pans the exterior of this set scratches very easity due to normal use. I store my set in a deep drawer in my new kitchen and removing and replacing these causes the scratches. I am very disappointed in the poor exterior finish and how badly this set looks. I would not buy this set again. I sent a pot back to Meyer for their inspection and am waiting to hear from them. I will probably replace this  set very soon, but not with another Anolon product",1

2309,"Underpowered, leaves sharp edge on can, slow. I was expecting a device that cut the roll-seam of the lid, but this one cuts the can just below the lid.  The resulting edge, while not razor sharp, is hazardous--in point of fact, the instructions warn, ""Note: The cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care."" contradicting the prominent ""NO SHARP EDGES"" claim on the packaging.On a typical can, the opener struggles to complete its task, coming to a near stop at times.  Of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life.  It has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical  303 can about 1-1/2 times.  For large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around.When the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can, there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can. There is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point, but if the reverse button doesn't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed, you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can--this manual release operation is challenging (and generally messy) to perform .The cutter--a sharp edged wheel--is not removable for cleaning, so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth (after removing the batteries).I recommend passing up this gadget",1
2310,Wrong Bowls sent and returned twice/Billing a BIG question. I never received the large bowls. The small cereal bowls were sent twice (quickly but wrong size both times) and I returned both orders. I was sent an e-mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and I would not be receiving the larger bowls. Then I got an e-mail saying I was being billed for them to which I replied what I received was NOT what I ordered and had been returned twice. I have all the paperwork on both orders. The plates I ordered were never received at all. I have NO idea what is going on now. It makes sense that I be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn't happening eithe,1
2311,"Not to be confused with quality copper. These canisters are sort of decent, I suppose, just not anywhere near the quality I was looking for. If you've invested in quality copper cookware like Mauviel or Falk, don't even think of buying these to match. The laquer coating on mine started to show signs of wear by the second month, and the bottoms had started to rust from the occasional wet countertop. The biggest one doesn't even hold a 5lb bag of flour, so nearly worthless, in my opinion. I wish I'd saved my money. Even at $29, they are about $20 overpriced",1

It's very good at  picking up dust, but, that's all.  It also if FABULOUS at getting over-heated very fast.  If you are looking for a great waste of money, and a fabulous workout from all the back and forth motion of desperately trying to get this to pick ANYTHING up off of a rug, this is the machine for you.  If you're looking for a reliable light-weight vacuum -- look else where",1

The big measurer did not easily expunge the food I was measuring and with having to grease the plunger to make it move easily added to prep and clean-up time. Liquids tended to leak. I think I am better off with a regular set of measuring cups and spoons,1

Although this vacuum sucks up enough for me to empty the container, I still run over and over the same areas and particles of dirt and I  move the debirs around. Sometimes it will seem to spit dirt back on the floor. It does not clean up outdoor dirt, potting soil, cat litter, or even small food particles off the kitchen floor. A broom works better than this vaccuum cleaner, although it says you can use it on floors. I have allergies and this also gets those going. As I said earlier- don't even bother",1

2322,"It just doesn't work. My wife and I are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats. Though the Catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with Sanisolution and granules, it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement. Unfortunately, they just don't work.Becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 Catgenies. Even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle. Even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly. They clogged everytime and beeped incessantly.Another problem is the scoop. Even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle, it always left turds behind. Those turds would then go through the whole cyle, which includes drying. That means that, even if they're scooped up the next time it cycles, they're going to be so dry and hard they'll never be ground up properly. Again, this results in clogs.We had them for a little over 2 weeks. In that time we had to run extra cyles, backflush and even take them apart and clean them.This product results in far more work, not less",1
2323,"Not the most efficient gadget. Positives are that it is a sturdy, heavy, good-looking, loud and easy to read timer. However, while it's easy enough to set, it takes sooo long to set it compared to cheaper, lower quality timers. You have to turn the dial or press either button, wait for the numbers to show, wait for the hours to blink, turn the wheel to the desired hours, wait for the minutes to blink and then turn the wheel to the desired minutes. Doesn't sound so bad but it takes a couple of seconds between each step before the numbers start blinking. As others reviewers stated, Kitchen Aid can do better",1
2324,"Accident waiting to happen. This product seemed like a good idea.  I mix my own cereal, and add lots of nuts and seeds.  So it is a lot heavier than the fruit loops that are always shown in the pictures.  The way that the holder fits into the base is not at all secure, and when full of heavy cereal, disaster is assured.  Also, neither the top or the bottom cover is a really secure seal, so tipping the holder caused the top to fly off for me, and some interesting times for my dogs cleaning up the floor.  I had a hard time taking the bottom seal off when my cereal bowl was in position. If you take it off first, then some cereal leaks out, causing the problem I was trying to solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests.I tried this product for awhile, but threw it in the trash pretty fast.  Went back to a big tupperware container  Not as convenient as this could have been, but no awful spills either",1

2327,"Okay but there are better options. I've had this pasta maker for 9 months and used it regularly over that period. Overall, it does what it is supposed to do. However, there are two major problems. First, two parts broke for seemingly no reason other than poor design and quality. The mixing bowl cracked on my first use and it took at least four months to get a replacement from DeLonghi. Recently the housing for the extruder shattered. I also lost one small part and had to wait months for a replacement part from DeLonghi. Overall it seems like there are too many parts, making it overcomplicated to clean and assemble, and the parts are of poor quality. The second major problem is that, the way dough is extruded through the circular feeding tube, the pasta easily falls together and sticks. You can work hard to keep the individual strands of pasta floured and separated---but isn't this supposed to be a machine that makes thing easier? Since buying this machine, I have also purchased the Kitchenaid stand mixer with the pasta roller and cutter attachments and feel this is just infinitely easier to use and produces much nicer pasta, particularly for flat pasta shapes such as fettuccine and spaghetti. I also ordered the ravioli shape for the DeLonghi and it produced sheets that were simply too small to work with. The Kitchenaid makes nice, wide sheets and you can adjust the dough thickness to meet your needs. Note that the extrusion machines (and also the extrusion attachment for the Kitchenaid) are your only options if you want to make shapes like macaroni.",1

When first obtained, could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon.  Now that I have had it a while, it can be removed, but it still troubles me that the handle, which does get exposed to food when using, can't be sanitized in the dishwasher.  There are other silicone spatula/spoons that have dishwasher-safe handles and I'd recommend those instead",1

I bought this machine finally today as it was the only one available in any store near me and I didn't want to go with the $250 Fantom one advertised on HSN or QVC so I thought I would try a cheaper one ($100 is not cheap) to see if these products work.Well I agree with anyone else who says it doesn't work.  I have used it all this afternoon and get about 10 minutes worth of cleaning done with each load of water.  My oven looks still horrible as it didn't even attempt to touch anything caked on.It ripped all the paint off the top of my stove (and I have found out that is about $450 to replace the top of my stove to have it looking nice again, thanks Europro).The only thing it did help with was my gaskets around the fridge.  They were black and really disgussting because nothing not even a toothbrush could get in there and they are somewhat clean but while cleaning it sprays filth absolutely everywhere so you end up doing more than double the work to get it looking somewhat clean but the filth it sprays all over your walls is not easy to steam off and I ended up having to use Fantastic to get it off the walls.I am going to take this back to the store tomorrow and get the $250 one as all the reviews I have read for the Fantom is great.Sorry Europro but your products do not seem to last more than a couple of days.  I also bought the Shark cordless vaccum and although it was great in the beginning it broke after a few uses.Anyone who says this product actually works must have a spotlessly clean appliance to begin with as it doesn't even come close to what they advertise on tv.I will never be scammed again",1

The back support for the book measures only about 7""x7"" and the depth measurement for the book is 1"".Any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7""x7"" is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand isn't big enough.  In addition, because the depth is only 1"", forget any book with say over 500 pages.  At least the Fellowes stand has a back support of 12"" x 9"", its deficiency is its page holding arms.

The board sucked up very little wax compared to my other boards.After a good meal with friends I was prevented from doing the dishes right away and the board ended sitting for two days before cleaning. By this time it had collected mold that is situated deep into the surface of the board and which I regard impossible to remove. I haven't and didn't experience this with any other board. The board looks good (without mold) and is very resistant to cutting marks, but if you decide to get one you should probably make sure to clean it right away after any use. I do not know if this is a general characteristic of bamboo or a quality of this particular board. I would have appreciated a word of warning or a useful guide as to how the board needs to be treated differently from boards made of wood.For my next board I will probably try to find an end-grain board made of American maple.

2338,"Noise, low pressure, grounds in my coffee.... I was very excited when my F7 arrived.  Out of the box it looked good.  After that, it was all downhill.  The first problem was with the pressure.  It dripped liquid into the cup - that was the rinse cycle.  The coffee cycle was worse - nothing but slow drips with a rare drizzle.  The second problem I had was with all those coffee grounds in the coffee.  Of all the coffees I have had (and believe me that was a lot), I have never seen so many grounds in coffee.  I ran the rinse cycle several more times trying to get the pressure to work.  Nothing improved.  I ran a whole container of water through it with the same results every time.  I went on line to find answers - Capresso's web site was zero help (and they really do need to answer their Emails.  Good luck to you if you need to contact them).  The third problem I had was the noise.  WOW!  Is that a lumber mill inside the machine?!  Are they putting out a fire in there after the coffee finishes its dripping?The bottom line is this - for $1300.00, there had better be rockets shooting that coffee out.  It should be at least what they claim - same as a professional brew house espresso maker (or 18 bars).  This machine is clearly not.  The coffee grounds need to be reduced (a lot - my French press has fewer).  Finally, the noise has to be less than my $15 grinder.  I am not impressed at all.  My $150.00 espresso maker put this one to shame.  Too bad, the idea was a good but the F7 needs a lot of work.  My F7 is on its way back.",1
2339,"Get Stoned. Do not be tricked into buying an ""easy"" sharpener. They DO NOT work. Spend the same money (or less!) on a good stone set that has various angles (i.e. Lansky, w/ 17, 20, 25, and 30 degree angles, and 3-5 stones: use 20 degrees for your ""slicing"" and paring knives, and 25 degrees for you chefs). I opted for the stone set (I'm a bit of a purist), but I've heard good remarks about the diamond set, too; the 3 grit set is all you really need: coarse, medium, and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such.With proper care, and light steel use (it's the re-aligning tool, not the sharpening device - be gentle), you'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two, depending on the work load you put on your knife. But, if you do seriously muck the edge up, you'll have a system that can repair your knife to ""good as new"" condition.My chef fell onto the tile floor, point first, and I had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later. The normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade.And, at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened, you'll be ahead of the game after the first use!Hint: use a 5X+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source, you'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened. You can also take a look at your edge before using the steel, and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it, then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel. And, see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - I admit I have a couple, myself.In short: get stoned, not taken",1

After a false start with antother type of laptop desk, I ordered a Lapinator. Fantastic customer service, lightning fast shipping, and I thought I was in love. The Lapinator is light-weight and comfortable, even though it's tilt angle is not adjustable. I ordered extra rubber bumpers and installed 5 rubber bumpers on the Lapinator just to make sure there was enough ventialtion. I was using a Sony S260 and just bought an SZ360. I placed the S260 on my old Lapworks laptop desk and had the SZ360 on the Lapinator while transferring files.

Now that I have the SZ360 on the Lapworks laptop desk, it's much cooler! I  mean MUCH cooler. So I'm back to figuring out how to keep the laptop from sliding on my old Lapworks laptop desk or just biting the bullet and buying a new one. Sorry Lapinator, you need to change the design, punch some holes in it or install some fins or something. Sure it keeps my lap cool but it causes my laptop to heat up way too much.",1
2350,"Sometimes the Ordinary is Better. In use, the cutting blade is hidden from view, so you can't see what you're cutting. A minor inconvenience. One of the 2 tiny screws that holds the blade escaped and disappeared about the fifth time I used it. You might want to ensure they're secure before each use.It cuts in one direction. If that direction is away from you, you'll prefer the left-handed version unless you're left-handed.On the positive side, it cuts vegetables pretty well. But no better than the $2 bi-directonal ambidextrous supermarket version I replaced it with.I bought it because I like the Rosle can opener, also very pricy. This has the same high build quality, but I found it less useful than an ordinary peeler. And heavier.",1

2354,"Overrated and overpriced. Having bought this knife over a year ago I must say I have had much better for less. I have since purchased a carbon steel Japanese Sashimi knife with a wood handle that is equal to the Global save it's blade requires a quick wash and dry to avoid staining. I find the Global's stainless steel blade to require less maintenance, however, due to its brittle temper the tip broke soon after I purchased it. My main critisism is that the continous metal grip is slick and with wet hands (as one might have when slicing a large fish) there is the distinct possiblity of losing your grip and your hand sliding forward toward the blade. In addition, the rear cutting edge of the blade adjacent the grip has a sharp edge exposed and given the slippery handle it is not as safe as other designs.  I wouldn't mind the high price as long as you get equal value. In this case there are better traditional Japanese alternatives easily found on the web. I suspect I helped pay for celebrity chef endorsements. I would not reccomend it to anyone unless a contemporary appearance is  more important than functionality; It is a good looking knife-even with a broken tip!",1

I'm in Japan, folks, it's not like there are no AA batteries available here!Now, here's the kicker - I CAN buy it here in Japan, from a TV Shopping network just up the road in Hiroshima, so how the heck can they get it shipped here (batteries or no) when I can't?

The quality was disappointing and does not compare with my old 200-thread-count 100% cotton percale sheets which were made in the USA (unfortunately the American factories are now closed).  The sheets are VERY thin and do not have the softness or body of 100% cotton. I ordered white sheets and the set that arrived was cream colored and yellowed.  A bleach wash removed some of the yellow.  I would not buy this product again nor do I recommend it.  I think Amazon should state that the sheets are made in China.  I need 100% cotton because I have an allergy problem with synthetics such as polyester.  I hope these sheets are all cotton but the thinness is reminescent of polyester.  Hope I am wrong,1

It is definitely a 2-person job and there was only me.  The self-adhesive tabs didn't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws.  Very awkward to use the screws.  Doesn't allow for any room especially the back screws.  I did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits.  Now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible.  I wouldn't have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet.

I agree with the reviewer who stated the purple color was more like a brown color.  The photo of these show that they are vivid colors but they are all dull in actuality.  The photo also does not reflect how the tab assembly is extremely visible and the boxes are made so that the tab assembly on the lid is right in the front, instead of on the side where it might have a chance of hiding a bit more.  Those tab assemblies scream ""cheap"", not inexpensive - ""cheap"" - losing huge points for aesthetics.  All in all, I guess you get what you pay for with these.

Like everyone else, the concept sounds incredible - never have to scoop a litter box again and it cleans itself? Sold! Well, the grass is greener but only slightly. Initially out of the box my unit had two issues: one, the scooper arm did not work at all. two, i received an error beep during one of the first few cycles and it shut off in the middle with the bowl full of water. Of course, trying to acclimate cats to a bowl full of water that is beeping at them is a bit difficult. I went through all the troubleshooting but finally had to call tech support. They were helpful and shipped me a new processing unit. The new unit had the same error once but then functioned ok afterwards. I had a month or two of ideal performance. Then recently, a horrendous noise coming from the unit while draining. Once again, I followed troubleshooting to no avail. Called tech support and they shipped another new processing unit after we went through a lot of troubleshooting. So three units in three months. The idea is great and when it's working, it is worth the money. But the amount of time I've spent on the phone with tech support and having to completely disassemble and clean out a very dirty hopper, makes me think my $300 could have bought a lot of other nice gadgets. My biggest concern is that I don't feel comfortable leaving for any extended period of time (like a long weekend) for fear it will stop working again. So although it is working now, I have the old litter box on standby in the garage for the next episode. Hopefully future versions of this will improve.

Half an hour later, some of the chocolate (on the outside of the crock, by the burner coil) had melted a bit.  An hour passed...still nothing much.  Now, given that cocoa butter melts at body temperature (which is why it is used in cosmetics), that's saying something.   The pot never reached 98 degrees!  If I'd put the chips in a zip-lock in my lap during dinner I would have had better results.Since this was a relatively inexpensive item, and I got it effectively for free during Amazon's recent Valentine's day promotion, I did not send it back (thinking it would be unfair to make them pay shipping both ways on an item which costs near as much to ship as it does to buy)...but, if you are actually paying for this- don't bother.

Bad decision on my part.PROS:  Looks great, coffee is really hot, unlike some coffeemakers and their lukewarm coffee.  Quieter than most when grinding. Customer Service is exceptional.CONS:  The grind seems to have one setting...coarse.  I am a home coffee roaster and the beans I buy and roast call for a finer grind. I tried doing a grind and putting back in to regrind, but this did nothing except clog up the thing and make a mess. The ""strong"" setting makes much weaker coffee than we are used to. Also,  for a two hundred dollar unit, it is very cheaply made. Be very careful with the pouring spout...very poorly constructed = MESS.After a week of frustration with this thing, I put it away and went and bought another Melitta.

I checked the box on Amazon's on-line site asking to have the set replaced, as I was requested to do, and waited for the E-mail to be sent that was promised in the instructions.  Five days later: nothing, not a word from the company by E-mail.  So, I went to a near-by store that ships things, paid to have the bake set packed up, and then paid for shipping.  Next, I went on-line and did a search on Google to find Amazon's 800 number.  As you will discover, you cannot find it on the Amazon site; at least I couldn't.  I called, sat on the phone for 15 minutes, and finally got through.  After discussing the problem with the representative of Amazon, I got reimbursed for the cost of the packing and postage to send the set back to the company.  And another set was sent.  It arrived five days later. There were no problems with these trays. Bottom line:  Too much time wasted to get the item replaced by Amazon.

2404,"Mine was defective. I purchased this electric skillet because I was pleased with a previous skillet (Model 06852).  The model 06852 is an attractive looking electric skillet that cooks beautiful, but one that I wanted to keep nice for company and buffets.  I purchased this Model 06851 for everyday use. The only difference between the two models are the handles and the lids. The skillet size and design are identical. The first time I used the product it worked properly and was cooking up to my expectations.  I have been cooking on electric skillets for over 30 years.The second time I used this skillet it began making a lot of noise -- much like it might be shorting out.  It also started cooking much too hot, therefore, making the meat hard and burnt.  I tried the temperature control plug for the model 06852 on the unit, but the problem persisted which told me the problem was in the coil in the pan itself.Just to be sure before I contacted Presto about their warranty, I made some Chicken Fried Steak in both pans at the same time, being sure to use the same temperature, and turning the food at the same time, and then simmering the steak at 200 degrees in a covered skillet to make it extra tender as I always do.  The skillet model 06852 produced a beautiful meal, whereas the meat in the skillet model 06851 was hard and burnt.  The meat came from the same package, so I know it wasn't the food.This experiment told me for sure the newer skillet I purchased (model 06851)a month and a half ago was indeed defective.  So I called the Presto manufacturer at the number provided on the warranty paperwork.  They told me I needed to send the unit back to them -- BUT I MUST PAY FOR THE SHIPPING.  If I received a defective unit that is only one and a half months old then I believe THEY SHOULD be responsible for the shipping cost for the unit to be returned to them since they provide no place to drop it off for repairs or replacement.  It is apparent they have very little faith in their products and make the consumer pick up the tab for the shipping on their defective units.  This was unacceptable to me and now I am letting everyone know that if you buy ANY Presto Appliance, and the unit is defective, you will be responsible to spend yet more money (approx another $15 for further shipping costs) before you can obtain a working unit.In the future I plan on buying from a different manufacturer.  I have purchased my last Presto product. I will not do business with a company that refuses to stand behind their products in a decent manner.  I am not a person that throws away good money after bad.  They give no guarantee that they will replace the unit with a working unit, so I could spend the rest of my life and a ton of money on shipping fees for defective merchandise from this company.  You might want to think twice before you purchase a Presto Appliance, because any and all defective merchandise you receive YOU will have to PAY MORE MONEY for the shipping cost to get it fixed",1

The main ingredients are corn and grain fillers and animal by-products. Is there even any real meat in this stuff? Check out the ingredients for high quality dry foods like Innova EVO or Felidae and you will see a big difference in the contents and their order. The good stuff has real meat as the first several ingredients. This stuff is basically Doritos in pellet form for cats and is  far from what a carnivore cat's natural diet would be. Yes, because this stuff is mostly filler, it is cheap. The real cost is to the cat whose health might suffer in the long run from eating junk food",1

2428,"Not so safe.... I bought six of these collars for my five cats. (I bought an extra just in case one of the cats lost one.) I thought the colors were great, and I was happy with the idea of the material, as opposed to cheap vynil. They do look fashionable, I think, and are discreet enough to not take away from the beauty of the cat itself. However, these collars are NOT ""breakaway"" collars. They enlarge if they get caught on something, but this actually only adds its own problems. Several times my cats came home with one leg through the collar (and the collar extended as far as possible). I hated to think what would have happened if the cat had gotten the collar caught on something AFTER getting the leg stuck. One cat finally did come home without his, and I didn't replace it. Another came home with the collar around her chest (both front legs had gone through), and it was constricting her. I pulled to try to get it off, but it was obviously very painful, and in the end the only solution was for me to cut it off. I decided these collars are not very safe after all--too bad I bought six at once (the reviews at the time were pretty good, generally).

Now that we've had it for 2 years, it's starting to spark while it's running and I am scared it's going to start a fire in my kitchen! I know others have had this problem, and I'm actually shocked that Sharp has not recalled this item because it really poses a fire hazard. So here's what I think: great, but doesn't work long term. And for the price, you would expect to keep it longer than 2 years. Oh, and if you decide to cook popcorn, be sure and take out the turntable and try to cook it on a bowl or in a plate.

So when it stopped working a month ago, I was heartbroken. Called FF, after some back and forth I sent the machine in for repair. The cost of repairing it is about $200, incl. the shipping. Add that to the $499 I paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine.After several days of back and forth with customer service, I still don't know what exactly is not working in my machine. Apparently, there are 3 items that have failed, one being the thermostat, a washer and something else, that CS was unable to explain. I really liked the machine when it was working, so I gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair, but at the end decided against it - I rather purchase a new Rancilio Silvia.When I called the CS with me decision and asked them to send the machine back, I was told that on top of the $12 shipping there will be a $13 handling charge for packaging the machine. I refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty. Long story short, I finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge, but that was one very unpleasant experience. It is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight I had with them.I really liked the X3 when it was working, and I would love to have it back, but it is just not cost effective at all. What is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance I provided, it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine, it should have worked a lot longer without any problems.",1

The pads do not prevent mineral build up on the hot plate. I am getting brownish deposits which I believe to be rust.

The right burner remains on at all times - we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off. So the right burner remains on hi all the time, and the left burner is either lo or hi, there is no concept of temperature control with this device... if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things... if it's a centimeter above medium it's hot - if you want medium heat to work, good luck.It worked ok until it broke, however it was never especially powerful.

Years of trusting Chicago Cutlery went down the drain with this purchase.How the company could risk its reputation for quality by putting out such a poor product is beyond me.The wood knife holder is fine.  The handles are smooth and well finished. The knife blades are a complete and total disaster.  The so-called ""STAINLESS"" steel is really a poor quality carbon steel.  I have the distinct feeling that my set was unfinished, as the serrated edges were so rough that slicing meats or even a tomato ended up with a tearing of the food.  I finally used a sharpener to take the unfinished edges down a little.  That worked, but seems dumb that they came out of the factory unfinished.The blades are very heavy whch may seem like a feature, but because the serrations are only on one side, when you try to cut, the angle of the blade edge causes the blade to turn , and prevents even cuts.The worst part, is the rust.  I note that after I bought the item, the term ""hand wash"" was added to the descriptive copy.  Even hand washing and drying did not prevent rust, and then of course, if the rust is allowed to remain for any time... pitting takes place.My wife bought the set at Christmas from Kmart... supposedly a $59.95 value for $29.95.  Hey... I was happy... a set of Chicago, at a great price.  Not to be... I have thrown away the original box, but don't recall anything on the box or the descriptive card that was included that said the set was imported from China.  Usually, when this is the case, the words ""made in China"" are imbedded in the blade.  Not so.  The blade has only the embossed ""Chicago"" brand.I used to work near the Chicago headquarters, and knew some of the workers, who had pride in their product. That was then, this is now...They say you get what you pay for.  In this case, I must tell you that I bought a similar set for our cabin, with a few less steak knives, but the same basic carving knives... no wood knife holder but a nice wood cutting board.  The set doesn't rust, cuts better, and the best part is that it had a day in, day out price of a flat $8.00.  The stamped brand was ""Gourmet Traditions"", and the ""made in China"" stamp WAS on the blade.We gave our ""Classic"" set away to Goodwill, with a warning that it wasn't worth more than $5-8.00""Chicago Cutlery"" made an enemy of me...

The colors bled all over each other in the wash.  Then to make matters the colored lint totally overtook my dryer.It was a mess.  But I was determined to get at least one wear out of this useless mess and so I placed them on my son's bed as well as my own.  The pilling NEVER stops!  Just like others reported the lint was all in our hair, on our clothes and some even flaked all over the floor.On the positive note, I purchased the pink set as well.  It was not as bad as the darker colors--as far as not bleeding and having lint everywhere. So I was able to enjoy the softness and warmth these sets offer.So trying again......I decided to wash each of the darker colored sheet sets separately....as I still got the same results.  So I tossed them.  They are not even good for scraps because of the constant pilling. What a waste!  Please believe if you want softness and warmth that badly you are better off cuddling with a pet who sheds it's coat in the spring...at least it would be less messy",1

It lasted about 7 months before it checked out into that big coffeemaker station in the sky.  I wrote Hamilton Beach and was happy that they responded, and they had me cut off the plug and send it to them, and they sent me number 3.

2463,"Customer Service is the worst!!!. I have owned 2 machines by Capresso. First a C3000 that needed a new pump before the waranty period was up. After being without the machine for nearly a month, it was returned w/o charge. It began acting up 2 or 3 months later. Coffee was not as strong. Pump did not pump consistantly. Capresso was no help at all. They said that I could return the machine at my expense and for $100 they would take a look at it. The waranty period had expired...  I did not want to give their service dept. another chance, so I donated the machine to a friend. I assumed that since Jura had added their name to the Impressa Z-5 that reliability had been taken care of. My mistake. 6 months after spending over $3000 for this machine, The symptoms started. Cold steamed milk, machine mysteriously shuts off during frothing cycle, grinder continues to grind beans on capuccino setting until machine is shut off or unplugged. I contacted Capresso customer service(Jura not mentioned) the exact same disinterested help was received. They offered to mail me a UPS shiping label ETA 1 wk. Then I can send my machine in for up to 3 weeks and they will repair the machine and send it back, another week. So for $3000 dollars you can have convenient coffee for 11 months out of every year give or take a few glitches along the way. But what if the problems occur again after my 1 yr. waranty expires? I asked. ""Call us right away and we can have you send it back.""(for another month.I long for the days of companies that care about the people that buy their product. With a price tag so high, I expect high quality customer service. This is the last Capresso/Jura I will ever buy. I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY FROM CAPRESSO!!",1

I did solve that by using 2 rubber bands to hold it in place. There is also a ""rigid core"" that fits inside the basket; my wife accidently threw it out after the basket opened when she had to clean it (I can see how it would happen).

2468,"perfect for ICED coffee. My cuisinart grind & brew recently died so I've been shopping for a new coffee pot.  (digression: cuisinart has the WORST customer service i've ever experienced in my life...)  I've read on virtually every customer review website out there that the coffee for the java studio is only luke warm, but since I'm a big fan of kitchenaid's appliances I figured I'd still give it a chance - especially since I don't like my coffee super hot.  I picked up the java studio nearly a week ago and it went back to the store yesterday.  The coffee was barely luke warm, and 'preheating' the thermal carafe hardly made a difference at all.  If the coffee isn't hot enough for someone who doesn't care for piping hot coffee, I can only imagine the frustration of those who do crave it piping hot.  On the note of needing to 'preheat' a thermal carafe, this is simply rediculous.  For all of cuisinart's faults, in the 3+ years I had my thermal grind & brew the coffee was ALWAYS piping hot and kept it's heat for hours (never needing to be 'preheated').  Needing to preheat a carafe renders an automatic coffeemaker useless - bottom line.  Kitchenaid needs to rectify this situation ASAP if they want to continue to keep their loyal customers.I swear by kitchenaid - the quality is amazing and the customer service is great.  With that said, I'm now the owner of a Bunn Thermalbrew (which is WONDERFUL).",1
2469,CHEAP. This vacuum is sooooo cheap.  The suction on carpet to pick up pet hair is terrible and on vacuuming an area rug it doesn't pick up hair either.

For the test I washed two feather pillows from our motor home, which had become musty during storage. I washed them separately, each with a towel to balance the load. After washing, I dried each set with a dryer sheet in addition to the balls, mostly for fragrance: one set of pillow and towel with the dryer balls and one set with two tennis balls. Both thumped noisily around in the dryer and both walloped the feather pillows and towels back to equal fluffiness. I had considered purchasing dryer balls, but my daughter-in-law contributed the two test tennis balls and I am have been perfectly happy with the results",1
2471,"Annoying and only somewhat useful. I live in a narrow and cluttered NYC apartment so I purchased this vacuum thinking that it could be used to clean up the floors and the attached hose could be used get under all the futurniture and other surfaces.It works ok at best on the open floor but when you get down on your hands and knees to try to get under the futons and behind bookcases, the exhaust ends up blowing the dust bunnies all over the place.  Unless you cradle the body of the vacuum against your body so that the strong exhaust dosen't end up scattering the dust you were trying to pick up, it ends up creating a bigger mess than when you started.It could be extremely useful as its light weight and versitile, but the design flaws make it a complete waste of money",1

2475,"It brews coffee but has some downsides. This item will indeed brew coffee, but not without some shortcomings.First, the mechanism that allows you to remove and pour a cup while it is brewing doesn't work very well. You have to use one hand to hold the unit in place while you forcibly shove the coffee pot into place; usually resulting in some spilt coffee all over the inside of the unit.Second, for some reason, the spout that empties hot water over the grounds inside is mounted on a swivel that you have to move in and out of the way every time you use it. Only a mild nusience, really , but nevertheless, annoying. I suppose the moron who designed it would have you believe it brews a better cup that way, but that is obviously nonsense.Also, The opening to pour the water into is very small--your aim better be good. If this is on an average counter top, you're going to have to lift the water up quite high and hope you can hit the opening without spilling.Lastly, the steam that comes off while it is brewing condenses on the front faceplate, where the switches and circuitry is and I can't help but believe over time, the moisture will penetrate inside and probably short out the wiring-probably just after the warrantly runs out.To sum up: Overpriced! Poor value! Idiotic design. [...",1

This may not be such a problem if the stupid ""self propelled"" function weren't constantly trying to shoot backward, meaning I need both hands just to push the unit forward. It's like I'm dancing with my vacuum and we're fighting for the lead. Ridiculous. I have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house, and I wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster.Oh--it also came with a free little red DD sweeper--the handle of which broke the first time I tried to use it.

2481,"Too much work to get it to work. I have carefully analyzed all the reviews (positive and negative) before deciding to buy this product in order that the right level of expectation may be set.  My need is very simple.  I have almost all hard floors in my house, either tile or hardwood.  So floor keeping is a relatively low maintenance chore.  I know Flip-It serves both as a dry vacuum and wet mop.  Knowing that both dry and wet debris are going into the same place and I want to eliminate the messy task of cleaning out the wet gunk, so I opt to use the cleaner solely as an electric mop.I like the idea that while it is mopping, the machine can also take care of the small amount of debris that I missed in my ""pre-mopped"" vacuuming.  It does take some practice to get the machine to do the job right.  Although I don't have the problem of puddles of water as other have experienced, I have other issue such as the cleaning pad kept sliding out.  I find the maneuvering quite exhausting due to the squeegee design.  Also, my finger gets very tired from squeezing the solution release button.  I don't find the cleaning result dramatic perhaps because my floors are normally quite clean.  The machine will not get to the wall edges so it won't eliminate manual laboring.  I'm also not sure if the heating feature does anything to produce a cleaner floor since the water temperature does not felt very warm.  After two days of experimentation, I decided that the machine is going back to the store.  For light mopping, I am going back to my Swiffer Wetjet.  It is cheaper, quiet, lighter, easy to use, and best of all, no cleaning up required.",1

I thought the colors were great, and I was happy with the idea of the material, as opposed to cheap vynil. They do look fashionable, I think, and are discreet enough to not take away from the beauty of the cat itself. However, these collars are NOT ""breakaway"" collars. They enlarge if they get caught on something, but this actually only adds its own problems. Several times my cats came home with one leg through the collar (and the collar extended as far as possible). I hated to think what would have happened if the cat had gotten the collar caught on something AFTER getting the leg stuck. One cat finally did come home without his, and I didn't replace it. Another came home with the collar around her chest (both front legs had gone through), and it was constricting her. I pulled to try to get it off, but it was obviously very painful, and in the end the only solution was for me to cut it off. I decided these collars are not very safe after all--too bad I bought six at once (the reviews at the time were pretty good, generally).

The plastic one was always hard to wash and store, and if you cook 2 or 3 days in a row was hard to always get in the dishwasher and be available.When we first started using this it was great, I actually gave away my other 2 cutting boards!

Kind of like someone grabbed each side and bent it up a little, it looks almost warped. Also, a large crack has developed that spans the length of the board.

2520,"Don't waste your time or money!. Short and not so sweet:First unit did not work at all,Second unit worked for about 3 months, then sporatically, then quit.I should have believed the other reviewers.Going to try the Senseo Supreme unit now",1
2521,"Simple, Effective While it Was Working. The Timex electronic timer is a convenient gadget for controlling lights and appliances.  With basic functions such as current time and a single event timer, the Timex electronic timer can easily control one or more electrical devices.Unfortunately, this particular timer is lacking in a few areas, which would otherwise make it simpler and more powerful. For example, it would be helpful to have a set of colored LEDs indicating the timer's event status and override status. Being a wall timer, which effectively locates the user interface very close to an electrical outlet, it can be difficult to reach. ""Table"" electronic timers are much easier to place as the interface is located several feet from the IN (power) and OUT (control) receptacles via an electrical cord with one extra conductor.With the recent focus in energy conservation, consumers are often using electronic timers to reduce their electrical usage. In my case, I use my timer as a third alarm clock. Connected to a very powerful full-spectrum light box(Sunray by Sunbox), it is set to fill up my bedroom with light, five minutes before my alarm clock(s) are set to go off. Additionally, it engages a powerful speaker system connected to a digital audio source. In this arrangement, the timer serves as a multi-sensory wakeup tool.While the design appears solid and robust, I have not been happy with its longevity. About a year after purchasing the timer, it stopped working. There is no physical damage. Moreover, opening the unit revealed no fuse nor obviously damaged components. This isn't a problem, however, as I have decided to upgrade to a table electronic timer for easier access.ProsSimpleCompactSleek designConsAmbiguous status (especially from more than 18 inches away)Only One EventLack of DurabilityPossibly InaccessibleLack of clear status indication",1
2522,"Don't believe the fake positive reviews!!! BAD Machine. It is clear that the November reviewers are all the same person... loser!Anyway, this machine is not easy to use, leaks, very wet foam... bla bla yuck!I opted for a Breville... the die cast 800ESXL and immediately noticed the ease and consistency. Of course my best recommendation is a Rancilio Silvia for home (friend has one) but it is labour intensive, have to wait for the boiler to heat up after pulling your shot... etc... if you want consistency in taste, ease of use, and good steam on command... do not buy this machine",1
2523,worst coffee maker. I agree with most reviewers.  This coffee maker is a piece of junk.  The few cups that I made were the worst tasting coffee ever,1
2524,DRIPPY AND MESSY. My mother swore by Hamilton Beach appliances.  This is one that I find myself swearing at!  The carafe itself is very drippy - I cannot pour a cup of coffee without having to wipe down the counter afterwards.  The paper filters constantly collapse in the brewing basket and then come out drippy and messy also.I miss my old Mellita - This coffee maker needs alot of help.Sorry Hamilton Beach - I'm calling it as I see it!,1
2525,"Not too impressed. I purchased this espresso maker about 2-1/2 months ago. I have used it about 2-3 times per week. My first disappoinment was the frothing wand. Not only is it placed in a place in which it is difficult to get a mug of milk or water for cleaning without first sloshing some on the counter. Second, the shape and style of the wand does all the frothing itself. If I wanted an automatic frother I'd have bought something cheaper. This allows no proper room for style. For someone who has not operated as a professional barista this may be fine, but I prefer to have more control over how much and what type of foam I create, thus I purchased a ""nicer machine"" or so I thought.For the most part I am pleased with the espresso itself. I most often get a healthy creme, and when I don't I'm sure it's operator error (improper tamping or whatever).One week ago I made a latte and left to run some errands. I returned to find all my incoming and outgoing mail sopping wet. Perplexed I took a good look around the counter, and noticed that the water carafe in my espresso maker was empty. I always fill it after making the last latte and remembered doing so before I left. I have absolutely no idea how this managed to get cracked.I called the customer service for Delonghi and requested a replacement. I was not asked many questions and the item will be shipped at no charge, however - they tell me that it won't arrive for 5-8 weeks. In the meantime, I am only able to put enough water in the tank to make one latte.I had thought this was the machine to last me for years, but now I am wondering how long it will really hold out.",1
2526,"I wish I'd paid more attention to the dimensions. Just when I thought I was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the US... I should have taken more notice of the other reviews. Beautiful glasses but they are way too small. My set will also be returned, they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use I would have for them",1
2527,"buy a different brand - 1 star is too many for this one. Dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them.  The device I received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity, some don't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them.  I had a chance to try a different brand years ago and I know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison.  If you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten.  There you go, suicide by dog, that's a good use for it.  May be it is just quality control, you might get lucky,  if not then you might have to deal with a seller that won't return calls or e-mail, like i did.  So you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad.  Go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones.  I hate being cheated.  Score another point for the bad guys",1

2530,"It Stinks!!!. Be forewarned, there is a 1-hour ""curing"" process that must be performed in a well ventilated area outside your home. I was aware of this requirement and performed the procedure on my patio. The instructions warn that the roaster will smoke during this procedure and it certainly does.The next day I used the roaster inside the house and that was a mistake. It only gave off  a small amount of smoke, but the smell was overpowering. If you want your house to smell like burning electrical insulation, your throat to burn, and your mouth to taste like you are sucking on a copper penny; then follow the manufacturer's directions. If you really want a Nesco roaster, I would suggest that you repeat the ""curing"" process at least two or three times before using it inside your home. I'm not sure this will work, it is only a guess as I was so angry that I threw mine in the trash.My recommendation would be to buy a roaster that doesn't require a ""curing"" procedure before use. If such a procedure is necessary, then the manufacturer should perform it.",1
2531,"not good at all. i had high expectation on this product since i was very satisfied with previous Revere purchase. but this time i was completely disappointed. the saucepans and stockpot have extremely thin walls. as a result, they are to be handled with care, otherwise they will be out of shape easily.",1

A friend wanted one but I told ,""Don't waste your money"". This thing leaks froms the overflow above the coffee basket. Many reviews tell the same story. The manufacture claims they are not aware of the problem. One rep actually told me I must be lying, as the machine can not leak as I discribed. It is finnally fixed. The next failure and it goes in the dump. This was suposed to be a treat for my wife and I. It has been a nightmare!!",1

The replacement unit didn't work either!  I made sure the pieces went together as instructed, and that the auger was properly snapped into place, but no dice.Amazon told me they could not ship another replacement because it was, and I quote ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.

2535,Su Weet. I just purchased the new one :(. I put it upstairs in the bonus room and bought another just like this. I gave the old away when I purchased the new one. Shame on me.

Therefore the first bit if tea was okay the last was way watered down..This one rocks !!,1
2536,"Stay away from this one!. This coffeemaker has many flaws and is made of very cheap materials.  I bought it a couple of months ago.  The basket has a tiny spring inside that positions the lever properly in order to control the pause and serve feature.  The screw pops off very easily.  This happened to me when I cleaned the coffee maker for the first time before ever using it.  I figured out how to put the spring back in place, but it pops out almost every time it's cleaned.  Also, the lid to the carafe no longer secures properly.  I'm still using this coffee maker while in the process of trying to find another one",1
2537,"A LEAKING MESS. I was really looking forward to this pillow, I have heard good things from my friends about them. First night was a bit odd, the pillow is very firm and takes some getting used to. I could also feel little beads under the cover, between the pillow and the cover. During the second night I could feel there were more little beads under the pillow case. I looked to see what was going on in the middle of the night, the pillow was leaking beads at an end seam. This is like a bean bag leak but the beads very small. So, after two nights this thing goes back and I clean up the beads. I am disappointed as the pillow itself felt good, but this is a mess. I am opting for a refund of the product and shipping. I don't think I want to roll the dice on a replacement, I'll find something else",1

2544,"Horrible Oven. I bought this toaster oven because it had a convection oven.  I have not toasted anything yet but I did make a small roast beef which took as long to cook it as it would if I had used my regular oven and the bottom burnt also. I only used it on the lowest degree and had to guess on how long to cook it.  The instructions do not give you any help with deciding how long and what temperature to use, so you just have to guess. I emailed Oster Customer Service to ask how long to cook things or if they had a some other instructions that might be of help, they got back to me and said ""use the temperature that you would normally use to cook the item and cut the cooking time in half"" that was not much of a help. I will not buy anything else made by Oster because of the trouble I had with another toaster oven made by them. This one looked good and the inside was large so I thought I would give it a try, I guess that was a bad idea.  I will be returning the oven to Amazon and I have no idea what brand to buy next",1
2545,Contains bad chemicals. We've had it for a few days and haven't used it yet. It has a chemical smell similar to packing tape. We've placed it in a room with a lot of ventilation. It has the ability to fill the room withthe smell.I'm sure we could manage to fall asleep with the smell but I would like to know that it's safe. The company has not returned any answer on this.They did say to take off the cover and wash it. The cover now has no smell.The smell has gotten better but it is still intense when you get close to the mattress.Update: It contains TOLUENE DI ISOCYANATE 80/20 (T.D.I.).

2548,"Too Much Imperfection is Too Much Imperfection. To us, typical Fiestaware pieces have great design, color, durability and functioning wrapped up all-in-one. We ordered a set of Turquoise Candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with &quot;straight candle&quot; results.  Even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product.  Specifically, the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles.  We were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better.  We are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations.  Fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform, a kind of &quot;softer&quot; look in the color application around the rims on plates, for example, and the piece will still look beautiful.  We don't want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our Fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces",1

(I'm glad I read all the instructions over before starting.) I am usually the one in our household that assembles furniture, because I usually enjoy it. This was just a pain in the ass, though. I am more than a little annoyed at all of the stupid stickers they felt the need to label everything with. I had a lot of sticky residue to clean off when I was done, although most of the stickers are in inside or bottom places, there were a few in the front and on top as well. This is the first time I've ever assembled anything and had problems with cam locks, too. I came very close to taking it back to the store, but it was a gift and I had no reciept. It looks gorgeous assembled, but they really need to do something about the packaging. There is no excuse for missing so many pieces",1

I only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts - so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half-frozen berries. After two months the motor started to have that burned smell when I used it. After three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack. At four months, the motor started making funny noises, it smelled terrible, and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use. All in all, this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash. I will NEVER buy a Hamilton Beach product again",1

Items that are seconds quality being sold as first quality. On average, 10% of our orders included slay slubs, glaze missing in spots and other imperfections.3.) Range of products severely limited4.)

Yes, I ordered this directly off this amazon page, and yes, I can report that it has seven fins (counting the outermost ones that hold the control panel, etc) and not nine. I read all the reviews just as you probably are doing right now, and thought to give it a shot since the preponderance of opinion seemed to think that there were nine fins and it worked great, as opposed to seven fins and working badly. But the radiator appeared at my doorstep with the lesser number of fins, however which way I tried to count the greater.So. In summary, seven.In other news, the heat all seemed to radiate from the top of the radiator; I could hardly feel any heat when I put my hands on the sides. Of course, I ran it on the lower setting, so it might have just been a function of the power output that I couldn't feel the heat radiating from the sides. (But I doubt it)I ended up returning it, for which I received a full refund! Go Amazon! But someone should really update that picture they have up top to one that us obsessive fin-counters can get a more accurate reading from",1
2583,"Wish I had another slow cooker... My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2005.  I was thrilled to get it since I had an older, smaller model.  I had never burned any food in a slow cooker before I used this model.   I couldn't figure out how to get it to cook SLOWLY.  I finally called customer service and was told I wasn't using the right kinds of recipes.  She told me that the pot had to be at least 75% full.  I used her advice, but it still boils everything on every temperature level.  I use it to make roasts and that is all.  It ""sweats"" horribly and I have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn't burn my countertop.  The handle cracked after 6 months.  My biggest ""ah-ha"" moment was when I came home after a long day out.  There had been a power surge, and it had reset itself.  My whole meal was ruined and that is when I realized the value of a dial-knob slow cooker.  Just back away slowly from this one",1
2584,"Could be better. We purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use. We make probably 20-30 cups of coffee a day. Our problems began the first week after receiving it. The machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam, which lattes shouldn't have. So customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy. We called the manufacturer's customer service and were rudely brushed off. For a small business like us it is hard to close for 2-3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service, so we had to deal with it.Another problem came up 3-4 weeks later, when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming/frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle. Sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate, just to steam milk. At the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours, which we did. It did not shut off for 1 day! The next day the problem started again...I perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily, so you can not say that the machine is being neglected.We are very disappointed with this machine. For the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite, understanding and helpful. Now we are looking for another machine, a back up one, to be able to send Impressa Z5 for service..",1

It does microwave but it takes a long time.  The biggest disappointment, though, was that it does not work at all on microwave popcorn.

When I adopted another cat 2 years later, it messed up the ""balance"", and everyone started hissing at each other.I tried Feliway because of all the great reviews I read on a couple websites. I used the product for 2 1/2 months, but finally decided to stop. My cats had always used their litterbox (even with the newcomer in the house because they had separate litterboxes). A couple days after I plugged in the Feliway, they started peeing on the rug in the living room, on the couch, the sofa bed, and finally in my own bed!! I tried everything to get them to stop, even to the point of throwing out all my bedding, yet nothing stopped them. The hissing got worse, they started having little ""cat fights"" (which they had never had before) and after 2 1/2 months, I finally unplugged the 2 Feliways I had purchased (note that I changed the refill every 30 days as suggested). It's been a week now, and things are a little better, but not back to the way it was before Feliway. I think it will take some time.

I found the amount of pepper ground per squeeze minimal.  My hand gets tired before I get an amount ground equivalent to two twists on a $2.59 self-contained pepper with disposable mill from the condiments section of any grocery store. Half of the pepper stays in the ball to fill the grinder teeth and further reduce the output.Although advertised as a one hand pepper mill, it is best used as a two handed device.  The squeezing action tends to broadcast the ground pepper over a wide area. If you wish to concentrate in a bowl or on a food item, one hand has to steady it over your target.Refill is a challenge and equivalent time is spent picking up pepper corns that bounce off the small, almost perfectly hidden fill slot.Again style overrides functionality.",1

After getting one today I decided to just use a mix for a quick trial. I used a lemon poppy seed muffin mix. When I took them out of the pan they just looked like splotchy blobs. They had not browned evenly and the patterns did not show clearly if at all. A very small ice cream scoop made filling easier, if you over fill they really look like complete blobs. Maybe a thinner batter would give better definition of the shapes? I don't know what to do about the browning. I may try one more time, then back it goes.

2657,"Patton Fans Suck, not Blow....... I bought a 20"" Patton fan in the mid 1980's, used it 24/7 year round, and it lasted 15 years. It was a very well built fan, and the speed control produced major variations between the low, medium, and high settings. The low setting moved copious amounts of air and was VERY QUIET.I just bought this 14"" model and it's a cheaply made piece of junk, but what can you expect from something made in China?? The speed control has very little range, and the fan is almost as noisy on low as it is on high. DO NOT purchase this fan for use anywhere you might sleep, or need a quiet source of air movement such as in a TV room, etc. They are best suited for a small shop, or outside while BBQing to keep the mosquitos blown into the neighbor's yard.The Chinese don't use enough padding and filler inside the box to secure the fan during shipment, so be advised the fan has plenty of room to flop around inside the factory box. Add to that the poor packaging Amazon uses to add a second box for shipment to the customer, and you have what amounts to potential shipping damage. Looks like the job some clowns do when shipping items they sell on eBay.To their credit, the fans are inexpensive and move more air than much larger fans.",1

2666,"A Disposable Vacuum!. Wow!  How clever of Euro Pro to make a disposable vacuum!  No other company has ever thought of that before!  They did forget to mention on the box that the vacuum can last up to three months.  This is a plus for people who don't want to purchase a new vacuum every month.  This one lasts so long (THREE WHOLE MONTHS!) that you only have to buy four per year.  At $60.00 apiece, that's only $240 per YEAR.  What a deal!Oh, wait a minute.  My mistake.  It's not supposed to be disposable.  But alas, it is.  Besides, you could take that $240 and go to a vac shop and get a commercial quality vacuum for about $300.  And it would  last for many YEARS, not just three MONTHS.After my first Euro Pro cordless went kaput (after three months), I tried in vain to get support from customer service.  Euro Pro's customer service is worse than bad, it is non-existent.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it a negative 10!Thinking that perhaps I just had a lemon, I foolishly bought a new Shark.  (I have a bad back, and it is difficult to bend over and plug and unplug a vacuum.)  It lasted three months as well. I thought perhaps it was the belt, and I finally managed to order a belt from the internet, and took the Shark to a vac shop to have the belt replaced.  The vac man said it was a piece of junk, but he swapped out the belt.  The vacuum will now pick up SOME of the dog hair off the carpet, though not much else, but it is useless on hard surface floors.Due to the complete lack of anything even remotely resembling customer service at Euro Pro, I will NEVER buy another Euro Pro product as long as I live.  I sincerely hope that my experience will not be in vain, and that it will help keep others from wasting their hard earned money on this or any other Euro Pro product.",1

It is possible to adjust the thermostat knob so that it keeps your room the right temperature, but when it is reaching the temperature that you've set, it switches on and off constantly.  (Like 20 times in 10 seconds -- seriously.)  I'm not sure that this one isn't slightly defective, since most thermostat controls have a non-switching region where they don't change their state as long as the temperature is within a certain range.  For instance, if you set your furnace thermostat to 68, it turns the furnace on at 67, not 67.992 and turns it off at 69, not 68.002.  This apparently doesn't have that feature -- it literally runs for less than 1/10th of a second on a regular basis.  I wonder how long the thermostat relay will last with the constant cycling.",1

2677,"Doesn't Remove Wrinkles. I am VERY disappointed with this product.  It is not powerful enought to remove the wrinkles from clothing.  The only way I found to get it to do a fairly decent job is to stretch the piece of clothing downward as it hangs, and rub the fabric with the brush on the steamer while steaming, going over and over the same spot.  It's like trying to iron vertically, only with no support behind the article of clothing.  It doesn't remove wrinkles nearly as well as an iron, especially if there are any unwanted creases, and it takes considerably longer than ironing, since you have to steam the same spot over and over again.  I bought the steamer because it uses tap water, and distilled water is a hastle to find when travelling, but tap water eventually causes irons to leave mineral deposits on clothing.   Instead of this product, I recommend a standard iron or travel iron.  It's easier to travel with a travel iron and just use a spray bottle filled with tap water to mist the clothes if you don't have distilled water to fill the iron with.  The Conair GS15 Hand Held Fabric Steamer is a waste of money that doesn't do its job",1

2684,Pump doesn't last. For what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months.  I really like foaming soap because I have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap.  Since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there isn't the big mess to clean.  But I have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap.  I searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and Cuisipro was about all I could find.  But within 3 months the pump started to stick and I have to manually move it up and down.  It's cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick.,1
2685,"A good start, but needs more refinement. When I first heard about the cat genie litter box I ordered one right away as it sounded wonderful to me! Someone had finally figured out how to make the perfect litter box! I gave away my litter maid box that my 4 cats had happily shared (I just made sure to change it daily and we had no problems) and begged my husband to install the cat genie right away. Well, he had more than a few problems hooking the thing up, and I finally had to call a plumber to make the connection to our toilet water supply as our hardware on the toilet was different from the illustration in the directions. That little adventure cost me an extra $100. Then the unit has to be plugged in. Well, who has an outlet near their bathroom toilet? We sure didn't. So we ended up having an electrician come and place a GFC outlet behind the toilet, add another $175 dollars to our investment. Finally, we had it installed and working properly and started trying to acclimate our cats to its use. We followed every suggestion in their guide, yet could not get all 4 cats to use the cat genie. The kittens were the first to accept it, then one of the older cats started using it, but the other older cat flat out refused. We started finding cat poop all over the house. We found some in the bathtub right next to the cat genie (maybe a cat had to go while it was running? each full cycle takes 30 minutes to run, that is a long time to expect a cat to ""hold it"") and we found cat poop on the floor right in front of the unit. But the killer was finding cat poop on our couch! We cleaned it up of course, but the whole family refused after that to sit on that couch. We finally bought a new couch! Add $1000 to our investment. When we bought the new couch we also gave up on the Cat Genie. I bought old fashioned litter boxes and now that is all the 4 cats will use, they leave the cat genie untouched.  We have found no more instances of inappropriate elimination since going back to traditional boxes. The Cat Genie sits unused in our bathroom still as I debate its fate.In my opinion, the Cat Genie just needs further refinement. It needs to function more like a litter maid and run just a short scooping cycle 10 minutes after it senses a cats has used the unit. The waste then needs to be stored in a hopper that processes and flushes away the waste a few times per day. The hopper needs to close to contain the odor of the waste. As the unit functions now, the waste remains in the open litter bowl in plain sight (and smell!) until the unit cycles, and the maximum number of cycles per day is only 4. Never before had my house smelled of catbox odor until the 3 months we tried to make the Cat Genie work out for us. Due to the high cost of the sanitizing solution, it would be very expensive to try to run it more often anyway. I think being used to a litter maid where the waste is scooped out after each use is what upset the one cat who refused to adjust to the Cat Genie. That cat just would not tolerate the sight and smell of the other cats' waste in the box and would not use it as a result.I know the Cat Genie people would say that the problem was that I needed to run 2 Cat Genies. Maybe that would have helped some of our problems, but I still think there would have been odor issues that would not have been acceptable to us. As things stand now, I'm looking for a new LitterMaid",1
2686,"Don't Buy It !. I bought this vacum at Target nearly six months ago. It has a very strong suction, and runs relatively quiet, but it cost a fortune to maintain! The root cause for this maintainence is that Dirt Devil designed this machine to use the Hepa filter as a vacum bag. All the dirt raps itself around the filter until its completely crapped up, and if you use it beyond that stage it will completely shut-down. I call customer service about it, and they recommended that I clean the filter more frequently. Which I now do, but I still have to replace the filter on average once every 2 months or else I'm force to breath all the fine particles that the Hepa is suppose to protect me from. The cost of each filter is an appauling $30 bucks. My car filter doesn't cost more than $7 dollars. At this rate I've already bought the vacum cleaner within my six months of use.

2701,"Inconsistent cup of coffee. I have not had any of the spillage or steam problems that  a lot of people seem to have.  My problem with the coffee maker is that it just doesn't always make a good cup of coffee.First of all, when I got the coffee maker I was surprised to find that to make the same strength of coffee I was use to, I had to use DOUBLE the amount of coffee grounds than I did usually.  So I go through coffee a lot more quickly than I did before.I always make coffee the same way, using the same amount of water and the same amount of grounds.  At times the coffee is fine, but at times it is extremely weak... so weak I have to spend extra time to make more coffee (a crucial part of my morning!)  The ""strength"" selector is completely worthless, I don't notice any difference in my coffee whatsoever.Furthermore, the digital analog clock face, while it may be aesthetically pleasing to some focus group, is REALLY annoying when you are trying to set the timer.  You have a digital clock, put digital numbers on it please.Finally the ""coffee temperature"" knob is useless unless you plan on drinking coffee at least 15 minutes after you make it.  If you drink the coffee right when it comes off the pot its barely warm",1

2703,"5 STARS for the Product, -3 STARS for the Packaging. I love the SANGO NOVA BROWN dishware and rate it 5 stars. This boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight. The slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer's comments. Mine too arrived broken. Sure seems like Sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box. Amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping. I sure hope Amazon gets credit from Sango for all these broken pieces. Combined score +2",1
2704,"Absolute junk!. I rarely write reviews, but this product was really awful: flimsy; and the levers broke off on first use. The plastic ones I bought at Williams-Sonoma a few years ago were MUCH better, but I couldn't find them anymore, so I thought I'd try these. I'd give them a negative star rating if I could. Do NOT waste your money",1
2705,"Pretty - but small. Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly",1
2706,"Could be better. I was impressed with all the pieces, & liked the pots with short handles. But, when washing the lids, the handles on top get full of waterand have to be sat up for water to drain out... s l o w l e y, before putting them away. Also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you're cooking. But, what do you want for 30 bucks?",1
2707,"This product is evil. This container is way too small to keep any fish in, let alone two. In such a small container, the fishes' wastes will build up quickly, causing eye and skin irritation, sickness, even death. You can try to reduce the waste build up changing the water frequently, but not only is this a lot of work for you, it is stressful for the fish.In addition, if you want to keep bettas in a divided tank, there should be decorations for the fish to hide behind when they need a break from flaring at each other. This tank is too small to allow that, another source of stress.Thirdly, bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to a constant 80F. It is not possible to safely heat a tank that is smaller than 5 gallons.If you want to get bettas, please read some of the excellent websites available and learn all you can about their care. If you cannot afford a proper tank, please don't get a fish",1

2711,"I wish I liked this baby more. . . but alas, I do not.I got this as a gift, and all I can say is ""gimme the gift receipt!""First some pluses:I really (really really really) like the removable water tank that feeds the coffee maker. You can pick up the tank like a basket, take it to the water cooler, and fill it right up.I also like the fact that I can make espresso pretty easily. No major learning curve.Now for the negatives:Within three months of one-pot-a-day use, the coffee maker was spewing water all over the place. And I do mean water. Not coffee. I'd fill the tank with 10 cups of water and only get six. The rest would spill out or evaporate. And while it was spewing and evapping? Oh, yeah--enough noise to startle people passing by in the hallway (I use this coffee maker at work). One other problem is that the coffee had a very plastic taste to it for the first 10 pots or so. Yuk. Also, the espresso maker does a great job with the espresso itself, but if you want cappuccino? Good luck getting the milk the way you like it. Talk about a learning curve. I got every result from watery milk to all-froth-no-liquid, neither of which is my preferred outcome.All in all, I'd much rather have a separate espresso maker of better quality AND my old Melitta coffee maker. Now THAT baby makes some killer coffee",1
2712,"Leaning Tower of Junk. I bought this item at my local Target the weekend I moved into my new apartment. The parts are quality chrome, and the wood top is certainly appealing to the eye.If only the pieces actually fit together to assemble a sturdy piece of furniture.One of the shelves doesn't fit properly over the four legs, and the finished product sways at the slightest touch. Judging by the glowing reviews on this page, at best, this product is a hit-or-miss venture.There's a reason it's priced at 30 dollars.  Buyer beware",1

I sliced veggies, and got all these tiny little plastic ""hairs"" that the cutting mat gave off as I sliced it up along with my veggies.  Had to toss them.

2714,"Save your money. After reading all of the positive reveiws and only a few negative ones I purchased this humidifier back in Dec. Well here it is early Feb and this thing just plain sucks. I have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room (13x13) and it never reaches higher that 29%. In the dry months of winter 29% is unacceptable, and my eyes nose and throat would agree. So don't do what I did, and save your money. Or if you must try it, just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill. Enjoy",1
2715,"Anger Management. Like so many others before me, I too thought this would be the best humidifier - and it was! For about one week. To boot, this is my second one. The first one had the exact same problem - it ran perfectly for a week and then stopped producing any mist. I tried all the troubleshooting tips in the extremely detailed and helpful ""manual"". I assumed I had broken the very sensitive oscilator and that it was my fault, so like a fool, I purchased a second. HA! Same problem. It took a lot of self control on my part to restrain myself from picking the thing up and throwing it across the room - especially when you have a toddler who has chronic bronchial infections and you just want the darn thing to work. Here is my advice for anyone who has a broken one like me and has missed their window of opportunity to return it because they thought they could fix it:Step one - open trash can.Step two - hurl VENTASonic into it.Step three - slam lid on can",1
2716,"Great - when the unit still works. I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a ""blue juice special"". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money",1
2717,"Hoffritz Wine Saver usability. I'm delighted with the functionality of this product. While doing an excellent job in bottles with openings that correspond to the stopper's measurements it is, however, too narrow for bottles with larger openings. A major shortcoming I found is that the black plastic material on the top of the stopper tends to break when closing the lock. Without the top material, the expansion effect of the stopper is decreased and becomes unsusable. Of the four stoppers I purchased, only one is still unbroken.",1

It works fine for rubbery semi-soft cheeses like swiss, but not for harder cheese like cheddar, which tend to crrumble before I can finish a slice.  The problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid.  It should be thin and flexible.Also, don't let the name fool you.

The water in this fountain is not running, though, but flows down a slope, so it's difficult for the cats to even see the water running.  My cats didn't drink from the part where the water was running.  I later bought a different flowing water pet fountain that runs more like a faucet, but we no longer use that one either because it is plastic and our vet recommended that cats should only eat and drink out of glass bowls, not plastic.  Apparently the plastic containers can cause irritations.  One of my cats had a swollen lip and the vet suspected the plastic water dish as the culprit.  Too bad no one has made a glass flowing water fountain",1

If you can afford it, buy one of the more expensive one's. This is a waste of time and consumer money",1

2728,"Great idea, bad execution. I ran into this knife when I was actually hoping to find one of those short Japanese sushi knives with the nice little wood sheath.  A nice multi-purpose portable knife.  I have a lot of small pocket knives, but but one of the most common uses I end up needing them for is food.  SO here comes a great idea: a small kitchen knife with a sheath!But there are some problems that could easily be fixed with little or no cost:1. The handle guard hangs down below the blade, while a food knife is usually better if the blade hangs down so it can chop flat onto a plate or board.2. The handle is shorter than the blade, but a short kitchen knife (ie, paring knife) usually gives you a useful handle length with a short blade. To make it worse, some handle length at the back end is wasted with that stylish drop-down bump, which is right where my pinky wants to sit.3. The sheath has no drainage hole. It's basically impossible to give the sheath a good inside cleaning. Plastic sheaths for many hunting or utility knives often have a small hole at the end, so you can flush it out all the way just by holding it under the faucet. It's like trying to clean a cup by slowly filling it with water and pouring it out. Not very sanitary for somthing I want to use for food.4. The plastic is cheap. Oils or alcohols are causing red stains when I wipe them on a paper towell. That means the plastic is not stable. Not only is the sheath difficult to clean, you have to be worried about what you clean it with.5. The steel isn't that great either. It was sharp when new, but that didn't last very long and when it was time to sharpen it the thing just didn't want to get sharp. I have sharpened hundreds of knives and I have a dozen different stones, and this is one of those knives that just doesn't like to get very sharp. It's not an expensive knife, but I had a Victorinox parer I got for 5 bucks that was better.For the price it's still handy to have, but it could be 10 times better and still be cheap",1

2730,"Beware!. We have owned this machine for a little over two years. For the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying. However, since then, it has stopped drying, such that 5 hours of drying (yes, 5 hours) yields wet clothes. This has persisted, despite 4 repairs, replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board, which I assume is next.Prior to this machine we owned an Equator brand washer/dryer combo which was a disaster: that broke after 3 years.Unfortunately, the LG is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines (Equator, Asko, Maber and other brands) available in the US..all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless-condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115V. The Bosch combos available in Europe, but unfortunately not available in the US, are 220V and thus, dry more quickly. This is not a machine for a family, but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most. When it worked, it worked well. However, no one should invest $1300 to have it break in such a short time. And no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry.

I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer of the Lentek PC16 who noted that the unit only works on the ""Audible"" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ""Ultrasonic"" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc.This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. I've tried two different units and they both do NOT work.The negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks.",1

You need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee.A truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste.This machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans.The espresso extracted is thus poor in taste.If you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra.You will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results.

I had to hammer-out the dented rim and re-paint all of the resulting chipped-off coating.

Of course, this is for temperatures below 140 degrees Fahrenheit.When I tried to use the thermometer for making beer, it finally gave out.  Having not used it in a few days, it currently reads 160 degrees.  It's busted and I've only had it since January.Some liquid was spilled on it, and the thing completely died.  Ultimately, the battery was replaced, and the device was left to dry.  It managed to recover from that, but it made me nervous.Maybe I'm expecting too much from digital thermometers, but I would expect it could handling boiling water.  I was using the probe to monitor some mash I was preparing for beer.  That is what ultimately killed it.This thermometer also advertises that it can handle candymaking.  This might be true, but I don't consider fudge that tastes like carbon to be ""candy."" It just lags too much for candymaking, and it didn't accurately display the temperature of the warm, sweet liquid since the probe couldn't be kept completely imersed while I stirred.I have to dig up the warranty and see if there's anything that can be done about this probe.

Worked just fine for over a year, then started behaving very oddly.Among the various problems this TOB-30BC unit exhibited, the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off, not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle, sending alarms when switched off, not being able to switch the unit off!  This unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and I consider it to be a fire hazard.  Repeated communications to Cuisinart remain unanswered.",1

It's a great deal in dollars per pound and ""old world"" charm.  I have actually gone back to using my $60 consumer quality dual-beater mixer.

They want all of this just to order a simple O ring gasket that goes on the the blender blade piece to act as a seal.

2778,"Doesn't live up. I wish I could write a good review of this coffee machine & Capresso in general but unfortunately my experience with the 455 model & Capresso itself has been horrible. I bought my Capresso 455 (Stainless carafe model) in July 2006. I was very impressed with the grinding options & the overall functionality of the machine & the coffee it produced was great. But by September the electronics had failed & the LCD readout was going haywire. I called Capresso & they immediately sent out a brand new machine to replace the faulty unit.The new unit worked perfectly until February 2007 when the drip basket stopped working. It would no longer stay in place when I tried to swing it over under the grinder to start the grind/brew process. I again called Capresso & they told me to pack it up & send it back for repairs. I then got a voice message telling me that they had never received the original unit that I had sent back in September 2006 so they wouldn't perform the repairs on this unit until they received it back. I won't waste your time with all the phone calls that took place about this! Suffice it to say that I HAD sent the machine back & I had never heard a word from Capresso in the 7 months since that time & now they were expecting me to somehow track their UPS return label to prove that the machine had been delivered!!I finally convinced them that there was nothing I could do about it now & they agreed to complete the repairs & return the machine to me but WITHOUT any warranty. The kicker to the story is that when the repaired machine finally arrived, it had brand new internal damage to it (the broken pieces were all over the inside of the water resevoir) & has had to be returned yet again. Naturally I have written to the President of the company about this ridiculous situation & while much of this problem can be written of as a bad customer service experience, the fact is that I have had 2 mechanical failures on this machine within a year as well as additional damage caused by the repair technicians (I'm fairly certain that it was not caused during the shipping - The unit was extremely well packed.My advice is this: If you can find another machine that does the same things as the Capresso 455 give it a shot. While this coffee maker performs superbly when it actually works, 2 failures on different machines within a year is not a good track record. I also found their customer service department to be extremely unhelpful as soon as they had identified me as a ""problem customer"". I never had a leg to stand on once they said they hadn't received the machine from the return call tag that they had issued. Why in the world would I have wanted to keep a machine that didn't work in the first place???BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",1

I sent them back when they weren't sealing and received a new set thinking they have a wonderful 100% Guarantee.  NOT! The new bags had the same issue which leads me to believe this is just an inferior product.  Great idea and it works at first, but if they can fix it to stay sealed AND make it of tougher material, I may consider trying one inthe future.  If not, save your money",1

It will grind pepper, but adjusting it is very hit-and-miss (mostly miss), and it won't hold an adjustment very well.  On a fine setting, it works OK, but it is nearly impossible to get a coarse grind out of it - it seems to go from fine to medium, and then to too open to grind at all.  We got better results out of a 20-year old no-name pepper mill.  I would not buy this mill again",1

Well, I guess I'm in the minority here, but following to the letter its instructions (for the 4 cup Brikka), the coffee always seems to boil in the top chamber, no matter how low a flame I use or how quickly I get it off the stove when coffee starts coming out the top.  If you like strong, burnt tasting coffee, this is the machine for you.I wanted to like the Brikka, but for under 30 bucks, try an Aerobie Aeropress  (recently got one and I love it) and compare espresso results.  For a great cup of strong coffee, it's very hard to beat the french press",1
2795,"Nice, but not END GRAIN quality. The other review for this cutting board is accurate, but fails to mention one important factor...this board is constructed of EDGE grain maple, not END grain maple.  This makes a huge difference when chopping and slicing.  End grain cutting boards and butcher blocks are prefered by home and professional chefs for a number of reasons.  End grain construction does not dull the edges of expensive cutlery the way Edge grain does.  End grain boards also cut easier, have a more varied and figured grain, and a cutting surface that lasts longer.  In the end, it's not worth spending $98.00 (with shipping) on a John Boos Edge grain cutting board from Amazon.com, when for the same price, you can buy a quality End grain cutting board that will perform better, save your knife blades, has a prettier grain, and will last a lifetime.This is a decent cutting board for the average home chef, but simply not worth the money.  Buy an End grain maple butcher block 16"" x 20"" for $80.95 from theboardsmith.com.  They have a large selection, quality construction, beautiful craftsmanship, and competetive prices.  When you compare the two, the choice is obvious.  And if you still want this John Boos cutting board, metrokitchen.com has them for $51.95 with no tax and FREE shipping!!!  Amazon just doesn't seem to stay price competetive when it comes to their houseware items.  Lastly, whatever board you get, make sure to season it periodically with FDA approved mineral oil.  This will keep the board from bending or cracking and will preserve your knife blade edges and the cutting board itself.",1

2799,"Feliway Diffuser Refill. I was told to try the Feliway diffuser by my veterinarian b/c my cat has always suffered from an anti-social, grumpy personality.  He is one of 4 INDOOR cats in our house and had started to urinate on the rug in my entryway.  I put the diffuser in the basement where the litter boxes are to make it a soothing, positive environment for him.  Combining the diffuser with a low dose of Prozac has worked wonders.  We have an office in the basement too and that is where it is plugged in and he spends pretty much most of his time in the office, sleeping, purring and scrounging love off me when I am down there.  He NEVER did that before.  We had only heard him purr maybe 4 times in all his 11 years and only when we practically had our ear near his throat!  I definitely recommend the Feliway diffuser for anyone with a stressed, ornery or over-excited cat.  Keep in mind, not all cats react to the pheromones but the only way to find out is to try the diffuser!  Good luck to anyone needing this review - it is really tough to deal with a problematic cat",1

After about 6 months the electrical connection between the hose and wand broke due to a very poor design. We took the vacuum to a local service center on 12/31/04. It's now March 15th and we still do not have a working vacuum. The local Houston service center failed to return our calls three times despite repeated promises. We were given the same incorrect part TWICE - once from the local center and again shipped from the central Hoover customer support center. We were told that the parts are back ordered from North Korea!I will say that the central customer support center personnel were helpful and positive, but it's been almost 3 months and still no resolution.We are very disappointed in this product and the support and we will not buy Hoover again. The vaccum is poorly designed and if you repeatedly disconnect the hose from the metal wand to use the accessories, the connection will break.

2804,"One word - Mold. Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser. All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.Pro:Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.)Con(s):Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to be safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it).Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth.Conclusion:Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product",1
2805,"Not for serious Chinese cook!. I bought this wok 6 months ago. I seasoned it very well and started to use it. But I noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when I cooked the dish with a lot of sauce. It meant I couldn't use it for steaming. When I made a fried rice, I had a hard time to clean it and re-season it. Most Chinese use a wok to cook everything, so I expected I could do that, too. But I was wrong. This wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry. That's all",1
2806,"Bought it, tried it, returned it. One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the ""flip it"" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the ""dirty water"" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer.On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day",1
2807,Steamed!. Once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and I will get a half of a pot of coffee.

2814,"Quick-Cup versus Eco-Pad...Winner is Eco-Pad!. I have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the Senseo Coffeemaker.  Folding filter paper didn't work....too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee....The Quick-Cup sounded like a good idea....but it doesn't fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee.  I found that the Eco-Pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well.  The key to any of these re-usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter.  The pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee.The Quick-Cup and the Eco-Pad are essentially the same design but the Eco-Pad fits the holder correctly and the Quick-Cup is slightly small.  Buy the Eco-Pad, it works.  The Quick-Cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the Quick-Cup and the holder...a gasket, to prevent the water from going around.   Good Luck",1

It is very reasonably priced and the motor has been powerful enough for the baking that I do, but those are the only two good things I can really say about it.  When mixing, ingredients fly out of the bowl all over the counter and me.  When adding flour, no matter how slowly, a cloud of flour dust covers everything within about a 5-foot radius of the mixer.  I have even tried mixing with a towel over the top of the mixer just to help eliminate some of the dust.  Also, I have arthritis and have found the beater realase button extremely hard to push.  I guess this mixer is a good buy for someone who will not use it very often because it is a good price, but a person who will be using it a lot may want to invest in something better",1

2824,"Two machines one cup of coffee. I ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback. We followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee. After that the machine said ""ventilate"". We followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself. Went to make another cup of coffee and it said ""ventilate"". This time it would not fix itself. I tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray. Turn off the knob and ""ventilate"" comes back up on the screen. Turn the machine off and turn it back on, ""ventilate"" came up on the screen.We called Amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later (thank you Amazon). Unfortunately, this one I did not get cup one out of the machine. It read ""ventilate"" as soon as I turned it on.

I recently purshased this set and have had real problems trying to get the lids to 'snap' on.The majority of the lids alMOST fit, which is somewhat frustrating in itself.  I've tried pressing, pushing, popping, and even putting all my weight on the lids without success.  Swearing didn't help the lids fit any better, either.  No surprise...it seldom does.  I even tried pliers to try to snap the lid on the oval piece.  Only succeeded in breaking the lid.  The aforementioned swearing rapidly graduated to cursing, although no hair cuttings, nail clippings, hatpin-stuck small dolls, nor sacrificial small animals were involved.  And, the lid STILL didn't pop onto the cookware.You just have to marvel at how the lids can come sooooo CLOSE to fitting...but, just absolutely refuse to go that extra hair's width to make the seal.NordicWare....WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THOSE LIDS???!!!!The lid issue aside, I've used the cookware frequently for storing leftovers in the fridge and for microwave reheating of same, and the cookware works fine.

2837,"Don't waste your money on this one. First of all, this is a very attractive machine sitting on the counter, but that is pretty much all.  The water container holds just barely enough to brew four shots before it needs to be refilled.  Speaking of which, refilling is a pain because the container is in the back of the machine, so I actually had to pull the machine out to the edge of the counter to get to it.  With this one, you need as much water as you can possibly get, because it drips water everywhere.  The first pull of the steam handle will give you about 2 oz. of water along with your steam, just what I DO NOT want in my milk.  In the mean time, the brew head will happily drip another 2+ oz. while you're steaming away.  Finally, there is the brew it's self.  Inconsistent doesn't even begin to describe it.  You never know what you're going to get out of that brew head, but you can bet you'll end up with a soupy mess of grounds after.  Let's see, what else... the drip tray is difficult to remove without sloshing a mess of stuff on the counter, the cup warmer is useless, the machine is VERY noisey, and just a piece of junk in general. No, this machine is definately not a keeper.So, before returning it, I did give Espressione a shot at making it right.  I sent an email to the warranty address, as well as copying several others within the Espressione group.  13 days later I got tired of waiting for a response and called.  Apparently there is 1 tech in the US to work on this thing, and he is VERY busy.  Wonder why!  So, I told the lady that I was pretty displeased with the machine, and their warranty service.  She responded that she understood, and another brand might be better suited for me.  Hmmmm... at least she is honest",1

2843,"Oxo finally messes up. I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4"" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8"" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door",1

Luckily, no one was hurt, but there is a dent in my kitchen ceiling where the top hit it, upon being expelled from the base with great force.

Even after I switched off the CD's I had in the doors to half CD half DVD, they still are crooked and off kilter.  The weight of the disks causes the doors to scrape the base and not line up correctly when closed.  This makes the unit nearly useless in my opinion, unless you want to make the doors all DVD.  I hate the way it looks damaged and sloppy.  I am kicking myself for choosing this item for pure aesthetics.  I merely assumed I was getting quality as well due to the price for this size unit, but that was not the case.  I wouldn't buy or reccomend this product unless you have low expectations and can't do with any other look for your decor.",1
2853,"Misleading. I am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs. Amazon's listing says this Innotek trainer comes with a ""lifetime warranty."" I've read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars, so I decided to review the owner's manual to learn more about the warranty.[...]The last page has a section entitled ""Lifetime Limited Warranty,"" which states "". . . INNOTEK brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship, under normal use, for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase.""The ""lifetime warranty"" apparently expires after one year!Further on it says, the company ""offers several product exchange options during the warranty period. . . . Costs are dependent on the processing time.""This suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year ""lifetime"" warranty.The next paragraph says ""After one year from date of original retail purchase, we will repair, replace or upgrade your product at afixed rate based on the component.""What will these repairs cost?This leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from Innotek.  What, if anything, is warranted for a ""lifetime?""  If the lifetime warranty is really only for one year, why call it ""lifetime?"" And finally, what will repairs cost, both during warranty under their ""product exchange options"" and afterwards under their component-based ""fixed rate?""My specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery. The manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable. Does this mean the user will have to send the collar to Innotek to replace the battery and, if so, what will it cost?I have contacted Innotek through their website and will report back if I get a response. Until I do, I've got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty.Can anyone comment on warranty claims to Innotek",1

Just like the previous reviewer, I had it on high for several minutes and the lower parts ended up dry and burnt and the upper uncooked. Uneven, slow and way too underpowered. The top sits down unevenly and the weight allows for little flexibility in top rising. It is a shame as the manufacturing and materials seems to be very high quality, but the design is horrid.

I hung on to this pan for 3 years, simply because I could not bear to part with it for the expense.  But eventually I had to treat it like my other All-Clad pans (which I LOVE) and use full amounts of oil to cook.  It was no longer worth using.Although the reviewer who loves this pan was ""certain"" the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly, that ""certainty"" is based on nothing but speculation.  I cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by All-Clad.

2866,"Don't do it. Listen to everyone on this website. I almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it's extremely poor design.  Mr. Coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers.  First of all, the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it.  This could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless, it's a filter, it's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water.  So before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow I would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate.  After the entire brewing cycle I would pull the carafe out and there would be NO coffee in the carafe.  After realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it.  The coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly.  Otherwise, the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter, clogging the drain and then voila, you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty, grainy water all over your counters.I do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason.

(Besides, I had had to deal with Cuisinart's so-called customer service in getting a worn-down part for the food processor, and didn't have the heart to try that again.  They berate you for ""misusing"" their products -- even if you're not complaining and it is only a wear issue.  Weird.)  Anyway, this mixer is done for.

I tried it for a day, but was not convinced either way.  Then, I bought the largest model, and tried it at home.  I used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the ""acid test"".  I used it in the toilet room, closed the door, and let it sit there for 8 hours.  When I inspected the room, I could still smell what I smelled 8 hours earlier. And I so wanted it to work!  The other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose, but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor (as does a HEPA air filter)",1
2880,Keyboard Drawer Inadequate. While very attractive this desk suffers from what so many inexpensive computer desks do an inadequately sized keyboard drawer.   There is enough room for the keyboard but not enough for a mouse.  This results in forcing you to have to reach forward to use the mouse on the top of the desk. I ultimately decided just put he keyboard on top the desk and raise up my chair.  The manufacturer should consider eliminating one of the drawers and extending the keyboard shelf,1

When she checked it in a short time, the water was boiling rapidly and could not be reduced to a simmer. No matter what setting, it just plain got scortching hot.There is supposed to be a one year warranty, but Amazon only takes returns in the first 30 days and in original packing.

It wasn't abused in any way, and these kettles usually last for years and years. The last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new Proctor Silex K4070.I wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique? Has anyone else had one with a short-lived switch, or was I unlucky?",1

The main part of the rack is very similar to wire cake-cooling racks, not very substantial, and the tray underneath is not slanted for water runoff as most dishrack drainers are.In addition to this disappointment, it was delivered in a huge box that looked as if it had been handled by Ace Ventura.  The single rack had banged around in the box that could have accommodated 15 racks, and as a result the stainless steel tray was slightly dented.  Very weird!",1
2888,"Flawed design. I have watched Emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter.  I just dismissed it as part of Emeril's shtick until I bought this machine for myself.  The first time I tried to use it with any liquid ingredients (making mayonnaise), it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl.  The top is just flawed in its design, as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl.  I suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that KA did, much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews (e. g. Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated).In any case, this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry (they blow through the badly designed joint as well) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter, the outside of the bowl, the bottom of the machine, and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do.  I will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the Cuisinart I have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard.",1

I couldn't push the handle back down. A little frustrated, I thought that perhaps it was a safety device that wouldn't allow you to trap your fingers, so I grabbed a potato to experiment with. Unfortunately, unless you use baby potatoes, they don't fit into the machine anyway. I find it hard to understand how this item can be called a ""potato cutter"", when it doesn't. I tried all sorts of things in the cutter and nothing would allow me to push the handle back down.

2893,"Bad Unit. Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another.

2895,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. I have owned this litter box, I'd say about 3 months now. I have to tell you, this is such a cool concept! However, I would be happier had I just set my money on FIRE. I'd sure be a lot less stressed at least.The first few days, it worked fine. I was so excited. My cats suprisingly used it, and I had no problems at all. I thought I was in heaven. But such is life, all good things must come to an end. It started erroring.. EVERYTIME I used it. Sometimes... for no reason. It would all finished drying the granules and everything would be dandy and BEEP BEEP BEEP.. so then I'd hit the button, and it would start all over again!! To be honest, I think this is a built in scam just so it uses more of that solution and you have to buy more... which btw, I'm pretty certain that solution is nothing more than a gimmick so they can get more of your money. The 300+ bucks just wasn't enough.But anyways. Back to the errors. It would error every time I used it. EVERY time. And it would always be a different error. I'd fix it (which btw, it drains like CRAP)... and then go on about my day. Well one day, I forgot it was running and went over to my neighbors. I was there about... 2 hours ish. When I walked outside her door, to my annoyance, I could of course, hear my ""so awesome"" cat genie... beeping in error. And to my even WORSE annoyance, apparently the long term beeping kept 2 of my 3 cats, from ever wanted to go near it again. So 1 of them kept trying to go outside to use the bathroom... and she's not an outdoor cat... and the other one just took it upon herself to pop a squat wherever she felt comfortable.Now fast forward about 4 days ago. My cat genie just STOPPED draining. Altogether. Stopped. I walked in and saw that it was about to overflow.. (the one time it doesn't give me an error beep!!) so I frantically turned it off and tried to fix it. It didn't work. I tried again... and tried for about an hour when finally, I accepted defeat and took it apart... and dumped the water. Most of it got on my floor.. which I was ecstatic about since that's what I was trying to prevent in the first place... went to my computer... and e-mailed the company. That was about 4 days ago... and I've not heard back from them since.So I assume they're realizing what a huge peice of crap they're selling and hopefully they either fix said peice of crap, or stop selling it altogether..... because I'm not happy that I spent so much money, on such a huge worthless peice of junk.Like I said, it's a cool concept...... but it just plain doesn't work. And for the people on here that it DID work for... Congrats. But 300+ bucks is too much of a gamble for something that just ""might not work"".Stick to the regular old litter box for now.

2900,"Form over function. The machine looks great. It sat nicely on our counter-top next to the Kitchen Aid mixer and looked really classy. If that was all I wanted to do with it, then I would have been very happy with it, but I actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos.Firstly, I found the steamer wand to be awkward to use. It rotates, but has little movement up or down. As a result, I found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when I was finished. It produced good foam though.Secondly, the indicator lights are so dim I found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not.Finally the espressos I made had no crema at all. I have been making them for 3 years with our current Saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one. After pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder. The machine was constantly leaking water & steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere.In summary: If you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter, buy this machine.

This little number is not real powerful, so you don't get the effortless, quick steamer results that most of us seek.  The steam output is low, so you go over and over the garment, with little improvement.  Forget about using it on linen.  Even on thin cotton, it creates tiny spider wrinkles.  You have to hold the hose vertically to prevent water from spurting, which is awkward and dangerous, as the hose gets HOT.  You have to have a door near an electrical outlet.  Then the hook doesn't fit over the thickness of the door, nor does the hose reach the item hanging from it.  It is as much work as ironing, but with ironing, you can eventually achieve the desired result.  The steamer is compact, heats quickly and doesn't take up much room.  I returned mine, but there may be a few people who like this steamer",1

This stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal (not silvery plastic), and sporting a sophisticated, drop-dead gorgeous retro appeal.  It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams-Sonoma.However, as is the case when function follows form, this is a horrible blender.  Don't get me wrong - I'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss-poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant.  But quite frankly, this blender is beyond bad.Most unfortunate is the blender's propensity to splash everywhere - even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand.  It seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing; it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor.  I suspect that the unit's quasi-industrial motor may be a contributing factor; it only supports two speeds: off, and jet-cyclonic.  While I admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right, the consequences of omitting ramp-up speeds are overbearing, consistently messy, predictably inconvenient, and potentially dangerous (as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing).  The irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward; and the blender's poorly-sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion.  In fact, this blender splashes so profusely that it's nearly unusable.It's too bad, because superficially, this blender really is quite the objet d'art.  But when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance, it has a long way to go - even in comparison to a $29 Oster.If I had to summarize this blender as accurately, succinctly, and fairly as possible, I'd distill it down to one word - ""regrettable.""",1

2927,"A Great Big Mess all over my Stove and Kitchen floor. We used this fryer a few times and never quite got the food to come out as crispy as we wanted. We attributed that to a learning curve about what oil to use and also the fact the we had never used fryers before.A couple things we were willing to put up with that could be improved were:1. The light turns off when the temperature is reached (wouldn't it be better to have the light go on when the temperature is reached?)2. The light is in a bad viewing position all the way towards the back of the fryer behind a big knob, so unless you're very tall, you have to tippy toe up to look down on it to see when the light is off. We are 5'6"" and 5'9""--3. There is not a digital read-out of the current temperature of the oil.But all those points became moot the other day when I made fries. While the fries were enjoyable enough (even though they were a bit soggy) after letting the oil cool in the fryer, I started draining it with the automatic filtration system. I was impressed with the functionality of the drainage system as I watched the oil drain into the bottom tray.Then I got about my other business in the kitchen.Several minutes later I looked over and the oil had leaked all over my stove and floor!!! There must have been at least two cups of oil that seeped all over my stove (luckily not my burners since I have a very wide older electric stove with a space large enough to hold the fryer.)

2933,Pleasant Enough. I Purchased a set simply because they came close in design to our everyday flatware.  They come in a nice pine box which has no lid so they do take up space on a drawer or shelf.  The knives themselves are very light weight.  Our set (black and steel) was fine with no obvious flaws.  The handles are lightweight plastic and the rivets are small so there is a question of how long they will hold up. They would have done better to use resin impregnated wood.  The tang does go the length of the grip.  These seem as sharp as any steak knives I have used and are quite comfortable in the hand and do afford good control when triming a steak or a chop close to the bone!  I would say they are of the same level of quality that you might find at a  Woolworths (of sainted memory!) or a K-Mart.  Not something to buy if you are really looking to even come close to the traditional high quality of either Sabatier or Laguiole.  That said I am planning on buying a second set to match the number of place settings of our everyday flatware,1
2934,"Very Puzzled & Disappointed. I purchased this item as a filler. I have two steamers already that are 5+ yrs old. First of all i found this item to be smaller than i expected. Secondly, i washed this item as instructed and left it out to air dry (as i do with my others without any problems), on the second day i noticed some dark blemishes on the underside. These eventually turned into numberous dark spots on the underside on both basket parts of the steamer. I have never experienced this before! They were deep into the bamboo, this item had just been steamed then washed in very hot water and allowed to air dry... i have no idea how this happened? I used one of my others at the same time and it never developed this problem. I returned the item to Amazon.",1
2935,"4 out of 5 items were defective. I really wanted to like this dining set - it looked nice in the picture and the reviews impressed me.However, when the set was put together 3 out of 4 chairs wobbled - 2 moderately and 1 really bad, the difference in leg length was almost an inch. The reason was easily identified - the connection holes in the back of the chair were drilled in a slanted line instead of horisontal. So no tightening the chairs with someone sitting on them would have helped (besides, there is just not that much leeway with metal-to-metal connections).But that was not all - one of the chairs had a warped back (paper thin warped veneer on the backside of the top). You did hear me say ""veneer"" - make no mistake, the set is NOT made of solid wood (the description does not claim it to be so, this is just a reminder).Compared to the above the ""tiny laquer drops"" defect on a small area of the table top was minor.I gave the set 2 stars only because it does look pretty good. If you want to give it a chance and are prepared to mess with getting another set to replace possibly defective items you might get good results after all. With 4 items out 5 coming defective I did not bother to test my luck again and simply returned the purchase. It took an hour of 2 people's time to put the set together and then another hour for me to take it apart and try to pack it back in the box (keep the box!) as this was the only way to return the set.",1
2936,"Don't buy refurbished. We had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out.  When I saw the refurbished for $20.00 I thought it was a great deal.  It would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn't leak!!  It didn't come with seals or with the water purifier.  I tried everything including new seals (that I bought separately).  Eventually we just went out and purchased a new one, because we still like the model.",1
2937,I don't understand why you are still selling this product. This percolator is not worth the price.  The coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot.I returned mine and purchased the Farberware FCP512S 12-Cup Cordless Percolator.  I love it!,1
2938,"Very flimsy!. I purchased two of these and the metal is flimsy.  Both ""boxes"" are warped and don't sit squarely on the counter (wobble).  There's nothing I like about them!  One was missing a plastic edge piece on the door. VERY DISAPPOINTING",1
2939,"BAD FIT. I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room.  He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a ""20 inch"" TV.  If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!!  I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!!",1
2940,"Junk. First, the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner.  That can be overlooked, but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability.  I may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks, no matter what setting I put it on.Horrible to say the least.  I sent it back and purchased a new one, which I enjoy to this day",1
2941,"DON'T BUY-NO PARTS OR SERVICE!!!. I purchased this for my daughter, and boy is it a cute idea!!! And it even worked okay, that is for just over 1 yr. Yep, just past the limited warranty. So I called Bissell and they informed me that there are no longer parts available for this model and my only option was to BUY a new one.Well, I told them I am not likely to do that, since it only lasted a year!!! We didn't even get to use the handle extentions that come with it. What a nice addition to the landfills!!",1
2942,"Not too hot. I baked six loaves in this machine.  I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right.  My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund",1
2943,"Though beautiful, alas, mine rusted too... One shouldn't have to empty water out after every use.  One shouldn't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice.  That is not a functional teapot, if that may be the case.  Though it is the prettiest teapot around, it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while.  Le Creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime, but the enamelware can't even touch the quality of the cast-iron cookware.  Fortunately, the company stands by its products and I am sending mine back for a replacement.  See www.lecreuset.com for details..",1
2944,"Holes not as small as advertised. The add said it would seperate small berry seeds.  The holes on the smallest grate are about 1/8"".  You could fit 20 seed through one of them.  Very disappointing",1
2945,"Was below-average for a while, then jammed. I received this blender for x-mas last year.  It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap).  However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes.  It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart.  While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months",1
2946,"My first Amazon return. A few times it worked great, but mostly it brewed uneven. I'm not being a nitpicker here... Literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim. There was no pattern to it, sometimes it was  the left one, sometimes the right one, sometimes neither. Filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging... don't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter! It only took two days before I realized this was not worth the money or the time",1
2947,"POOR CHOICE - STEER CLEAR. I purchased two Digital KCM-515 Steel 10-Cup Coffee maker as Christmas gifts (one for myself and the other for my sister).  Both of these units turned out to be major DUDS and will be returned quicker than Santa can navigate his way back to the North Pole.PROBLEM: The coffee comes out WARM and the carafe DOES NOT retain warmth for more than 10 minutes (and that's stretching it)!  The heating plate is only warm to the touch immediately after brewing.  You have to microwave the coffee almost immediately after it is brewed.COMMENT:  The reviewer who wrote that having to pre-heat the carafe with piping hot water BEFORE brewing a pot of coffee had it right!  That should have been a clue.  I had the same ""gut feeling"" when I read the instructions.  In my view, a consumer shouldn't have to waste hot water to ""pre-heat"" a unit with a stiff sticker price!  As for the reviewer who implied that those of us who are dissappointed with this unit need to read the instuctions -- gimme a break",1
2948,"pretty awful... I bought 2 of these dispensers, one for syrup and one for honey. The dispenser is too stiff for children to use, and while the syrup moves quite freely, it takes hours for honey to pour. It makes for a sticky mess. Definitely not worth having",1
2949,Handle breaks easily. I bought this crock pot because it didn't look like a traditional country style crock pot. Unfortunately the handle broke off with the slightest bump. You can't even buy a new liner on their parts web site. This thing is a flimsy piece of crap.,1
2950,Do Not Buy This Product. Do not buy this product or any other product with the Perfect Pour Carafe.  The brilliant designers at Black & Decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe.  The problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over.  Nice work guys.  One call to their Customer Service line was cut off.  On the next I chose the option to leave a message and be called back--unfortunately the mailbox was full.  I guess the poor product deserves poor customer service,1
2951,Hole in One Water Globe. Very disappointed when it broke after 15 minutes of handling.  Very thin glass edges.  Will not buy again,1
2952,"Not very happy. The carafe has a plastic insert with a strong smell. There was no instruction how to pull it out (instructions were very general, incomplete and written in not very good English). I did not get any response from the factory, so I did not have a choice and had to return it. Also, for this price the outside of the top should have been plated better",1
2953,terrible customer service. If you want to get a migraine and be stuck without a mixer for the holidays this would be the company that you would order from. It is now january 18th and i have yet to receive the mixer or refund on the purchase of this product. i have called and called and called jr electronics and to no avail i still havent received a refund for this product,1
2954,"Go back to the cutting board. I bought the Chop Wizard thinking it would save me time in the kitchen, but it hasn't.  Food has to be prepared (destemmed, decored, sliced, etc.) before going in the device to the extent that I might as well do all the work with my knife and cutting board.  Depending on the food, cleanup can be a hassle too.  Last night, I spend ~ 2 minutes using the cleaning comb accessory to get sweet potato out of the plastic grid on the underside of the lid.  I feel guilty for adding to the waste stream with this device that in my opinion is an insult to the tried and true, fast and easy, cheap and simple knife and cutting board",1
2955,"Not worth the money. Its not light as advertised.  Its actually a very cumbersome broom.  I'd rather use a regular broom than this huge thing.  I would not recommend for every day use.  The bristles get bent due to the weight of it, and they don't sweep as well after a month or so",1
2956,"not the colors stated in the description. Yes these are beautiful dishes, however they are not grey and slate blue or two shades of grey.. they are purple!!! so when they arrived at my door I was really disappointed.. purple doesn't go with the color scheme I have... and slate blue/or grey would have done nicely!so the one star is for Amazonz inability to properly describe the item",1
2957,"Don't Bother!. Total rubbish. Wood was scratched on top, corner was smashed, water damage on the shelf, and door was cracked. It is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use. The holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together. Extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control. To add salt in the wound, the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and I had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it. If you like taking chances and do still want to buy it, it's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged.",1
2958,Find another blanket. I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.,1
2959,"Flimsy and uncomfortable. We purchased the Lapinator Plus for $30 plus shipping, as well as the jumbo ""Microbead"" lap desk for half that price ($15.99).  The microbead desk has a much thicker molded plastic top; the microbead filled base pad conforms to your lap much better and is more comfortable; it's 2 inches wider, 1 inch longer, and accomodates my widescreen laptop better; and it has two pencil wells and a clip on one end so it can be used for a lap desk without the computer: Again, all for half the price of the Lapinator.  The Lapinator Plus has a flimsy, light weight piece of vinyl for a top, a stitched edge, and an uncomfortable foam base that puts my legs to sleep. Buyer beware! Check out the microbead lap desk first.",1
2960,"Like a Ferrari: a frustratingly fickle machine. I bought a Capresso 114.01 espresso machine via Amazon in December of 2005. I had selected it in part, because of the high ""bar"" pressure rating. Upon receiving it, the first shot of espresso took several minutes to make. The coffee just drips out one drop at a time. The manual suggests ""using a coarser grind than other espresso machines"". I tried progressively coarser grinds until I was at the coarsest setting of my burr gringer...the coffee was getting weaker, and coming out a little faster, but still taking many minutes for one shot of espresso, with a weak and bitter result and no crema. The manual suggests tamping the coffee ever so lightly. Good suggestion, because if you tamp it with more than a feather's weight of pressure, you get no coffee flow at all. I called Capresso technical support numerous times. They suggested disassembling the machine--unscrewing the metal screen on the body of the machine where the water comes through-- and cleaning it. I did this to no avail. Besides, one shouldn't need to service a machine that is less than a month old in this way! After two months of frustrating, hit-and-miss results, I returned the machine to Amazon. Because it's after the 30 day return period, I may not get a full refund, but I'm glad to be rid of that piece of junk. I have since purchased a $180 Krups XP 4000 espresso machine that just works beautifully, with any grind of coffee (even very fine), any tamping pressure (even quite firm), the machine produces 2 shots of espresso in 25 seconds flat with tons of crema. What a relief",1
2961,"The first time a Taylor product has disappointed me. I bought one that didn't always work, and a replacement one was even less reliable.  I upgraded to a higher priced mechanical timer from Taylor and it didn't work at all.  What can have happened to Taylor products?!",1
2962,"This one is a Dud!. I have numerous KA appliances, including the stand mixer and Food Processor.  I was happy to see a nice salad spinner, but was disappointed when I opened to use it for the first time.  The middle plunger which you are to turn counter clockwise to remove will not budge!  I tried, my husband tried and it is impossible to remove, therefore, I am unable to use the store feature since I cannot remove the plunger.  Something as simple as a salad spinner should not be so complicated",1
2963,"A BIG disappointment. I thought this pan would be multi-purpose. It is not.It is also very ""tinny"" and not so well made.Save your money and get a adonized pan instead",1

2965,"Not all it's cracked up to be. This grater is not a convenience, it's more of a punishment.  I have tried it for hash browns, cheese, chocolate, etc.  I thought at first I was using it incorrectly, but then realized, there really is no wrong way of using this.  Everytime I have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that I would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually.  My fingers and hands ache so bad that I can't even hold a pencil after using this gadget.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Unfortunately, you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star, but in reality I give it NO STARS!",1
2966,"Good but unpredictable. I bought this coffee machine in October 2006 from Amazon after reading the reviews on this page, and I knew that some users had problems with the coffee leaking over the sides and onto the hot plate. But I figured that it was only happening to some of the customers and some of the time.This coffee maker makes great coffee and it looks good on our counter.But this coffee machine needs constant supervision because, at least in our case, it will drizzle/drool/leak over the sides and onto the hotplate and frequently in enough volume to also go over the edge of the plate and all over the counter. If we set it up to make a 6 cup pot and go off to have a shower, we frequently come back to a mess on the counter top, because at least a cup of coffee has not made it into the carafe. And as someone noted, it's impossible to figure out how to resolve the problem. We have looked at the ""drip stop"" mechanism in the basket, and there's nothing obvious here. We've looked at the top of the carafe and there's nothing there either. You can seat and re-seat the carafe and sometimes it will work, and and other times a disaster. Today we are simply staying in the kitchen to watch the entire pot brew, as the leaking can occur at anytime in the brewing cycle, not just at the start. I am now so annoyed that I am writing the company to tell them how annoying this is. And I buying a new coffee maker. I am not sure Amazon will allow me to return the machince, but I will try. Buy something else unless you really like troubleshooting a design that needed a bit more beta testing before it was  ready for production",1
2967,"High Defective Rate. I purchased two of these items through Amazon.  One of the units worked briefly, then quit; the other never worked at all.  Under the vendor's return policy, I returned these items (at my own expense) to the vendor for a refund and ordered two more directly from the vendor.  Only one of these additional two units worked.  That's three out of four defective--a 75% failure rate, and the buyer has to pay the return costs.  Further, this is not the first time I've had problems with ""GE SmartHome"" products.  An earlier purchase of other items of the same brand from another vendor also produced defective merchandise.  I would give these items ZERO ""stars,"" if that were possible",1
2968,"BROKEN into a 1000 pieces. I rated this product a 1 star, because I was never able to see the product as it was sent to me BROKEN.Amazon has got to get with the packaging program.  I was handed the box by the delivery guy and I heard tiny shards of glass rattling around.  I opened the box to discover PATHETIC PACKAGING, no peanuts or anything just a broken crystal decanter inside of a box. HOW STUPID.  The main box didn't even have glass or fragile written on it-so I'm sure the delivery guys were anything but careful with it (for all they could tell it was a box of fluffy sheets.)However, Amazon says they will pay for my return shipping and replacement.  We'll see how this goes.  I'll keep you posted when I receive the second item.  Wish Amazon luck",1

Despite this after one time of using the chopping knife and hand washing it, it has begun to rust. I wish I would have registered for the more expensive knives. In the long run it would have saved me money",1
2970,"Works, but not for long!. In principle, this should be a great product.  We got one and set it up in a few seconds.  Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking.  (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.)  Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit.  That one worked great...for 5 days.  Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund.That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer.  Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer",1
2971,"Hate it. My previous coffe pot, a cheapie Black-n-Decker, developed a habit of overflowing; because the cheezy ""sneak a cup"" mechanism would not function properly, creating the equivalent of a flooding toilet.Well, I spent $$$ right here on Amazon to buy the Braun instead, and guess what? I now have an overpriced flooding coffee toilet.I have owned this unit for around 6 months now, and on a given day, it will..a.) produce the Flooding Coffee Toilet effect, with grounds and coffee everywhere (15% chance)b.) Leak so much coffee during brewing that what started out as a full pot ends up as an 8-cup pot with the remainder on the counter (80% chance). Careful observation indicates this is due to a badly designed ""sneak a cup"" feature. The coffee creates a surface tension on the base of the basket, and trickles off to the edge of the coffee maker instead of dripping into the carafe.c.) Deliver the expected pot of coffee (5% chance)[note on option b.: I keep the coffee maker on a tray, because I got tired of cleaning up after it]I will -not- buy another Braun. I should have boxed this unit up and returned it to Amazon the first week I had it. I kept saying to myself ""It must be good, it was rated the best!""Well guess what?

Out of the box, the machine performed well and true to other feedback, the frother worked extremely well.  The steam control knob was required to throttle steam flow to achieve micro-froth.  After using every day for 2 months, it now takes 20 minutes to make a latte and there is barely enough steam to froth.  If you're serious about making espresso, pay a little more and get a more robust unit",1

I honestly get a better clean from using dishsoap",1

2977,"Can a scale be too cranky and indecisive?. I've gotten into bread baking and many of the books recommend measuring ingredients by weight instead of volume so I bought this scale.  It's very affordable and made by what I considered to be a good manufacturer.  I didn't think, though, that I would meet a scale that is so temperamental and indecisive.  I always place the scale on a level, flat surface but when I put something on it to be weighed, the readout fluctuates anywhere from tenths of an ounce to an ounce or two, going up or down and not really settling anywhere.  I have to wait a minute for the scale to make up its mind about EXACTLY how much the object weighs.I probably should have gone to a brick-and-mortar store to check out the actual design of the scale before I placed my order.  Instead of individual on/off and tare buttons, this scale has ""on"", ""off"", and ""tare"" marked on the front edge of the scale and you are supposed to press down on your function of choice and the edge kind of buckles down and activates hidden buttons inside the mechanism:  Bear with me here, this is weird and hard to describe!  And it doesn't work very well either.  Sometimes, pushing down on ""tare"" turns the scale off.  I don't know why they didn't opt for simple straightforward buttons for the functions, but there you go.The button that switches the scale between pounds/ounces to metric is on the bottom of the scale.  While it doesn't particularly bother me, one time, I did want to weigh something in one system and switch to another (too lazy to bust out the old conversion formula) and I had to remove the item, turn the scale over, flip the switch, and start the weighing process again.I think I should have returned this and bought another model that would have made me happier.  This was a lesson in buying gadgets without physically checking them out--this scale looks good on paper and has a very affordable price tag, but it's not the best digital scale out there.  More than half the time, I don't feel like dealing with this wishy washy scale so I just measure out my ingredients by volume.  Which, indeed, defeats the purpose of why I got this scale in the first place",1

What a waste of money.It made very good coffee while it worked.  The last time I expected it to function, I was greeted with a flood on my counter and floor.  All 6 cups of water had leaked out.

It is supposed to charge and clean itself, but that only happens if you can keep the thing together, and I bet you can't. It doesn't take long for the power paw to stop working. Mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops. The cleaner itself loses suction over time. The dust catcher is easy to empty, but don't forget to buy all the filters it needs. This is a poor choice",1

To be fair, this did occur in the humid month of August in New York and the strain proved beyond the model's capabilities (still, I was absent for only 3 day).   Maybe splashback from the fish was a problem.  Probably fine with day-to-day feeding in nonhumid climates, but why not just get a cheap, basic model for that",1

2987,"Worst Product in Our Wedding Registry. My wife and I put a white Toast-R-Oven from Black & Decker on our wedding registry, thinking it'd make a solid addition to our kitchen. Within the 1-yr warranty, our toaster oven stopped working. The button for making toast had ceased to depress and hold, requiring us to manually push down the button if we wanted to make toast. B&D had us snip the electrical cord and mail it back to them (I suppose to make sure we weren't just asking for another unit while keeping our current one).We received the replacement a few weeks later, but this one also broke. Unfortunately for us, the 1-yr warranty had just expired. This time, the problem was the heating element on the roof of the unit. One of the elements (a rod-like tube that goes lengthwise along the toaster) started giving off sparks and then collapsed. Instead of staying pressed against the top of the unit, one of the rods had partially fallen down, bending at an angle. You might think this was a case of user-error, perhaps by the owner accidentally ramming too big a chunk of food into the toaster and cracking the heating element... but I am positive that neither one of us touched the topside heating element. (We typically used it to toast Eggos and bread; with the pan, we used it to warm up leftover pizza, taco shells, cookies.)The oven no longer works since the topside no longer generates heat. The bottom still gets hot, but a funny smell permeates when the oven is activated, probably because of the broken heating element on top.Overall, this device is of such poor quality that I would not pay a single cent for another. This is the WORST item on our registry -- a piece of junk that causes headaches and frustration. I will NEVER buy another toaster oven from Black & Decker, and I am afraid to try any of their other kitchenware. I just can't trust their workmanship or design",1
2988,"USELESS--VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER. I usually like Oxo products, but this one is a real loser. Not only does it not give accurate readings (which in itself should deem it useless, being that it is a THERMOMETER after all) but there are other features that further enhance its horrible design. First of all, the ""handy"" (so they claim) spin dial that allows you to set the temperature that you want to reach, is so flimsy that the slightest movement of the thermometer throws the dial off. Useless. Secondly, after only one handwashing, water seeped under the dial face which is impossible to get out. The water then turns to steam which fogs up the display so you can't even read its inaccurate readings. 2 weeks later there is STILL steam under the dial. Useless again. And to pour salt on my already stinging wound, I had emailed Oxo to inquire about how to return this item and get a refund weeks ago, but they have yet to respond to me, even though on the package it states that satisfaction is 100 percent guaranteed. Well, I am NOT a satisfied customer and if my second attempt to reach them proves fruitless once again, then I doubt I will ever purchase another Oxo product again, no matter how good they are. It pains me to even give this product one star, as a product that's utterly useless deserves no star at all. Oxo should be ashamed of themselves. Thanks for allowing me to vent my 2 cents",1

Also, another reviewer said you got two for this price, but that is no longer true.

The bit at the end of the blades get hung up in my Presto slicing guide as the blades are too short; further, the switch is extremely temperamental and only works if you move your thumb around a lot. I'd return it, if the postage, packaging and trip to post office were worth it + trying to dig up original cash receipt! These people do NOT want return business!

2995,"A Horrible Piece of Crap. Trust me, don't waste your money with this thing! I researched and shopped around for such an item and made the mistake of thinking this was good. Well, here's why it isn't:* The pump gets clogged repeatedly, every few days or so, and it's a pain to clean.* The filters don't last very long and the material of which they're made begins to ""shed,"" so to speak, thereby falling apart enough to have their fibers in the water.* The pump doesn't last long, period. I'm on my second pump--the first one lasted only a couple months--which itself now crapped out after a month.* Mold will build up inside the unit very quickly.* If the water level gets too low, it becomes noisy.Believe me, you'll love this at first but get very frustrated with it soon enough.",1

I worked in a laundry and dry cleaners when I was in college so I knew the principle operating techniques of this item but it still takes practice, to learn positioning of the items and to keep from burning yourself.  No it isn't as large as the ones in the laundry but where would you store that thing any way and did you really think it would sell for under 2 hundred dollars?

This is a great little pan that does a wonderful job at making perfect little cornbread sticks.  I've done them in the oven, as well as over coals and they've turned out fine every time (first time they stuck and broke when I took them out, but the pan still cleaned fine).  The only reason I gave this a 4 and not a 5 is because it's not terribly practical.  It'll only cook one small batch at a time (1 1/2 cups of cornmeal mix).  However, if you want something really fun and different, this is it",0
3011,"Great Purchase!. We have been using Riedel crystal wine glasses (and still do on occasion with the handful that we have left), but I finally decided to buy Spiegelau glasses for our everyday drinking glasses.  Because we drink wine and entertain regularly, our collection of Riedel glasses has been diminishing --- although the crystal Riedel's are beautiful glasses (and still used for the right occasions), they are extremely fragile and I have personally destroyed several while simply hand washing them.  At any rate, after years of attrition via visiting friends and family, we needed to stock up on new glasses.  Because I hate to hand wash dishes, I began to look into the dishwasher-safe glasses from Riedel and Spiegelau for the new replacements.  I was going to just buy the dishwasher-safe Riedel glasses (name recognition of course), but I couldn't get over how much better the Spiegelaus were priced.  Moreover, all of my favorite restaurants use Spiegelau (and come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen Riedels at a restaurant). Therefore, I took the leap and stocked up on the Chardonnay, Cabernet, Riesling, Port and Champagne glasses.  I'm really glad that I did --- all of them are terrific! Although not as elegant as the fine crystal versions, these are excellent for everyday use and large dinner parties.  I've already bounced one off of a granite countertop and it survived the collision without incident. I've also washed them all in the dishwasher several times and they've come out great.  I am very, very happy with this purchase.  I'm sure that the comparable dishwasher-safe Riedel glasses are just as nice (possibly nicer?), but you can't beat Spiegelau's price!",0

It's not as perfect as an old seasoned cast iron skillet, but the le creuset pan is big, heavy and practically non stick, especially if you use a bit of oil.  I cook everything in it -- chicken, hamburgers, fried eggs and omlets, sausage, pancakes -- and it's easy to clean, almost as non stick as my teflon pans (which I chucked).

All of them were cooked evenly and it behaves like a ""non-stick"".Tonight I made a nice 5-layer lasagna that brought it up almost to the top with no overflow.

I have been using this instant read thermometer for the past couple of months and am impressed by the speed at which this tool registers the temperature of the different items that I am cooking.  It seems to be accurate as each meal that I have used this for has been cooked correctly.  (I have used this for chicken, beef, pork, and other assorted dishes.)  The thermometer appears to be extremely sensitive as moving the tip to different parts of the meat can give significantly different readings -- so a word of caution about making sure that you are inserting the probe into the proper location.  In the past few years I have used several instant read thermometers (both digital and non-digital) and this is the best one (of the four or five) I have tried.",0

I've never used ceramic knives before and now I've used it a couple times I will never buy any other kind again.  I am sold on ceramic knives.  I don't know how durable it is but I put it back into it's box after hand washing it just to be careful because it cuts like a dream.  I've cut chicken breast, green onions, bell peppers, steak, pork, carrots, broccoli, all sorts of stuff just to try it out through meats, veggies and fruits.  I put it on the chicken breast at one end and pulled it right through in one clean cut.  I cam straight down on the green onions just to make sure I move it a smidge anyways to cut through.  Seriously I won't use those metal knives I got for my wedding gifts or christmas gifts any more it's ceramic all the way for me.

I originally thought it could use more shelves & after contacting the manufacturer, they were prompt in sending me more shelves.  What service!  I do see some irony in the fact that the cabinet is so well made & comes with a lock, but the back is made of cardboard that is easily coming off because of the usage.  Go figure!  Otherwise, a good product & serves it's purpose well",0
3036,"As described....awesome. I have had 4 different bread machines, all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style.  I didn't mind the bread they turned out, but I didn't like the loaf shape.  My prayers have been answered!  I can't quit making bread now!  The loaves come out perfect, and if they don't I have come to relize that with bread it is typically the COOK's error, not the machine's.  You need to really read the directions, which I find most people don't.  If you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine, you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it.  I've made all kinds of sweet, sourdough, french, italian, herb and cheese, fruit, and beer breads in the machine.....you name it, and they all come out just fine.  If not, I tweak the recipe, I don't blame the machine.All in all, an excellent product. This is my favorite bread machine so far.  The only down side is the sourdough setting.  Don't be fooled... the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar.  For true sourdough, you have to wait the 7-10 days.  But if you can't wait....  Oh, and the ""big viewing window"".  Unless someone installs a light inside the machine, you can't really see what's going on anyway.  After my first 50 loaves I will let you know how it's holding up",0
3037,"Good value,  and... ...be aware that it is not top of the line cookware. It's a little lighter which might be an advantage for some people. I bought several of these as gifts and the only negative I heard is that it seemed to scratch a bit easily. Having said that, I would have used only wooden or plastic utensils anyway so that would probably have been avoided. For the money, it's worth a shot. You can always use it as a planter :",0
3038,"Nice product, taller molds are more useful overall. A serious foodie that has been perfecting her cooking skills for the last 25 years in her home kitchen writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are ""The Professional Chef"" by the Culinary Institute of America and ""Culinary Artistry"".  If you love to make your food as beautiful as it is tasty, you will enjoy this product.I find these molds most useful for making risotto cakes, making short vegetable stacks, small frozen mousses or cutting rounds from cakes to serve as a bed.  For items like stacks you can pack the mold and then slide the ring up to make a taller stack.  However, this ""stretching method"" will not work for a taller frozen mousse.  I imagine you could secure two molds together for a taller frozen mousse.  But since I have not tried that I am uncertain as to how well it would work.  The height restriction of 2 inches makes these molds a little less useful than my set of molds that are 5 inches tall.This product is well made and should stand the test of time.  If you don't already own a taller set of molds I would suggest that you consider that purchase first, I find them to be much more useful in my kitchen",0

You squeeze two tabs with your fingers on the top to let the air out to open/close it - with the lid on, its an airtight seal, so no more worrying about bugs or stale pasta. I like the clear canister, because I can easily see if I have some open pasta before I get a new box out of the pantry and its made of a very durable material that won't break and is dishwasher-safe. If you eat a lot of pasta, but don't always eat the whole box in one sitting, then this is a must have",0

The smell in her room was so overpowering that I could not stand to go in there without holding my breath.Once we got the Litter Robot the smell went away and we are living happily ever after.  It worked perfectly right out of the box, we have used it for several weeks now without any problems.  I am so pleased with this Litter Robot, it works perfectly even when operated by a teenager",0

3051,"A few tips for effortless use!. After reading the other reviews, I almost reconsidered my purchase.  However, the juicer works great - as long as you follow a few tips.1) Make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on TIGHT!  Check once, then check again.2) Don't use the paper filters, particularly if you are juicing in quantity.  Once I threw mine in the trash, the balancing issues went away immediately.  It makes clean up a little harder, but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use, it's not a big deal.3) If the item being juiced won't go through, be patient, and pulse-push it in.  Don't cram it with the pusher.My only concern is that when you juice quantities, so much pulp sticks to the side it's hard for all of the juice out to strain out.  It's best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice.Using the above tips - I expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time",0

Then I deep fried chicken patties and french fries. What a dinner we had. It was gr8!! The frier heated up quickly ... made the food fast ... did everything I wanted it to. It has continued to work as expected ever since I picked it up. Even easy clean up. Nice!,0
3062,N-ice cream spade!. works very well.  handle is balanced and fits well in the hands.  cuts right through ice cream.  excellent product.  worth the price for those frozen ice cream buckets that feel like they'll sprain your wrist with every scoop,0
3063,"Great gate!. This is a low gate, so if your dog is large or a jumper, it may not be right for you.  Otherwise this is a great product.  It is asthetically pleasing and very sturdy, yet low enough to step over.  It's defintiely my favorite gate and I've been through a few",0
3064,"Great pan. I have an entire set of Swiss Diamond in addition to this pan. I bought Swiss Diamond because, due to weak wrists, I needed sturdy cookware that was not as heavy as stainless steel. Because aluminum is the primary, affordable, lighter-weight alternative, and one does not want food coming in contact with aluminum because of the possible leaching of it into the food, I sought non-stick pans with a coating that would not flake or scratch off and end up in my food. After much research, I discovered Swiss Diamond. I have not been disappointed. The pans are a great weight--hefty without being too heavy, and after several months of use, the coating is holding up beautifully. I confess that I do not primarily use metal utensils in it, however, so I can't testify about how they hold up against metal.These pans caramelize food beautifully, and the evenness of the heat distribution in them is a pure joy. They do take a few extra seconds to heat up, but hold heat very well. I really love how flat the pan's bottom is, and imagine if you have a flush electric cooktop, these would be especially appreciated. Though I have a gas range, I had trouble in the past with pots and pans slipping and sliding on the enameled grates, but these pans do not slide. And I was delighted to discover, after realizing I had accidentally left this pan on low heat for an hour with no food in it, it did not warp at all and is still in perfect condition. This cookware cleans up easily and perfectly, too. I love that they are coated on the outside walls of the pans so any dried or cooked on food comes off the outside as easily as the inside.One thing to note is that if you are looking for a pan to cook eggs in without oil, this may not be your best choice. The texture of the diamond coating seems to grab more than a slick Teflon pan would, and the first time I tried to flip my fried eggs without a spatula, I had less than stellar results. But with sufficient oil, I can flip the eggs without a spatula or a problem (I need to make my daily quota of coconut oil anyway for health reasons, so I'm fine with putting oil in the pan). If you use a spatula, you should easily be able to flip eggs without oil.I do hope these pans turn out to be durable over the years. So far, after a few months, they are aces! In fact, my husband may be growing weary of my exclaiming, ""I LOVE this cookware!"" over and over again.",0

3070,Decent grinder. This grinder has worked well enough for me.  The biggest problem I have with it is that the plastic lid rattles loose while grinding--so you need to hold it in place to keep it running.  This is a minor deficit since most grinders need their tops held on while grinding.,0

3072,"Most useful item in my kitchen. I have had this for almost 5 months and use this for almost everything.  The chopping accessory is great for onions, tomatoes, etc.  I do a lot of Indian cooking and this is a huge time saver.  Easy to clean.  A ton of power.  Have had to use my regular hand blender as this has so many accessories.  The balloon wisk is great for whipped cream, and egg whites, etc.  Cannot recc. this enough.  Use this every time I cook",0
3073,I loved this product. We just got our Zojirushi Gourmet Duet Dual-Mug Personal Coffeemaker this weekend. We used Boca Java blended coffees and our well water (we live in the boondocks). The directions were simple to understand. The amount of coffee that fills the cups was perfect. We used regular #2 filters (not the unbleached kind). I was stoked! This is a great cup of coffee! We have used $400 coffee makers that didn't perform like this. I definitely recommend this,0
3074,great deal. I love this duvet.  I knew ahead of time that the back side is regular cotton but that didnt dissuade me.  It is very soft and plush and beautiful.  For 20 dollars you cant beat it,0
3075,little but mighty. This Mini Prep Plus is perfect for the small jobs you do while cooking a meal and takes less time,0
3076,"Great for wheatgrass. I just bought the omega 8005. I am very impressed with this unit. I have been juicing the last 13 years and this is the fourth juicer I have used. The auger, end cap and hopper are all quality. The fittings are secure and quality. The unit looks good. It is quiet. It leaves very little mess. I don't have to worry about one drip hitting the base motor. Cleanup is quick. I bought it to juice wheatgrass which it does a fine with grass.  The supplied plunger does work, but using a carrot to push the wheatgrass down the opening is much easier and twice as fast. The 10 year warranty is phenomenal on all parts and labor.I actually use my old centrifugal juicer to juice a glass of carrot juice, and the omega to juice wheatgrass and leafy greens. I believe in using two different tools for two different purposes. If I were only going to juice hard apples and carrots, I would not get this juicer because it would take too long to extract the juice from these.  I would get a centrifugal juicer. But a centrifugal juicer cannot do what this omega can do, namely spinach, parsley and wheatgrass.",0
3077,"I Love It!. I had bought my first Fiestaware Cereal Bown sight unseen from Amazon.com, and I absolutely love the rich, cinnamon color of Cinnabar!The Cereal Bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal, soup, ice cream, and leftovers (smaller portions). It's microwaveable, too!If you've never used Fiestaware before, this would be a great introduction to the line, especially if you have use for smaller soup/cereal bowls.",0
3078,Presto Popper. This is one of the best units I have ever used.  The care of the powercups is a bit tricky but just let cool and wipe with a dry cloth and you will be fine.  We love this unit because we have little mess and fresh popcorn instead of microwave popcorn in a bag which tastes nothing like the fresh popped corn.  I love to add spicy salt to my oil before adding the popcorn which will lightly cover the popcorn to create your own unique tastes.  I highly recommend this unit,0

3081,"Great look, reasonable price. I purchased 2 sets of these glasses in December 2006.  They look great, have a nice heavy feel to them, are of obvious good quality.  I could not be happier, and I'm now going to order the larger 13.5 oz. size too.  If you have any doubts, you can forget them now, and buy these classy glasses.  If you like the look of this style, you will not regret this purchase",0
3082,"THIS IS THE BEST THING EBEAR!!!. I made lattes the beary first day I got this and LOVED it. I think I ordered one as a gift for my friend almost immediately after finishing my drink. She loves it as much as I do:) We both wanted a stovetop milk frother and after doing some research, I went ahead and got this lovely set by Bialetti. I wanted to be sure it was awesome before getting it for my friend;p I believe we both used it at our Thanksgiving dinners and everyone loved the drinks too.In about 7-8 minutes of turning on the stove and the espresso is done. The challenge for me was making the drink hot enough. This meant that I would have to heat up the milk several minutes (on a medium setting because I was afraid of burning the milk) prior to making the espresso. Another trick is to keep the cups hot with hot water before making the drinks. I read somewhere that a french press can be used to froth milk but I wouldn't risk doing it in glass with metal mesh. There are a few other frothers I have seen with this type of construction. This Bialetti frother pot is nonstick and not only is the mesh in a plastic disk, it actually has a double disk, which I think really adds to the frothing. I've done a lot of looking around at various milk frothers in various stores and no other frother has a double disk pump. If you add sugar to the latte, it's best to add it to the espresso before the milk or else it'll just sit on top of the foam. I love hazelnut so I bought a flavoring syrup (which I stir in with the espresso before adding the milk) and it's AWESOME. I also like to add a little cocoa powder on top;",0
3083,"A good knife, but not a great one. This was a difficult knife to rate, because on the one hand it is a very nice knife, and on the other, I can't recommend that you buy one.1)  This is a beautiful knife.  I don't prep with it, but it has a permanent place on my magnetic strip, because I just like looking at it.  If you want a Damascus-pattern Japanese knife that looks pretty, this is a good choice.  You must also look at the Hattori HD (different Damascus style, black Western style handle with visible rivets), and the A.G. Russell Damascus (better Damascus pattern with white Eastern handles and visible rivets).  They are harder to find, but nothing a quick Google won&#8217;t fix.2)  Do not buy this knife unless you have held it, and preferably used it.  This is true of any knife.  Handle comfort and balance are extremely personal issues.  My love affair with this knife ended as soon as I took it out of the box.  I'm a right hander with large hands and I use a pinch grip.  I like my knife balanced exactly on my working fingers.  With its curved, offset bolster and ridged handle, it's specially designed for a right hander with small hands, using a pinch grip, and even then it's mediocre.  Using that grip, the balance is 2cm (3/4"") nose heavy.  My $25 10"" Forschner Fibrox embarrasses this knife in term of handle comfort and balance.  The only Shun knife with a real handle is the Ken Onion custom.3)  This knife is razor sharp out of the box.  But really, any good knife will take a 15 degree edge, you just have to be willing to put it on yourself (or find a pro you can trust to do it for you).  My Wusthof Grand Prix has a 15 degree edge and is as sharp as this knife, and gives me at least 50 hours on the board before I need to touch it up with my Sharpmaker.  The same goes for my Forschner.  VG10 is better steel, but you will still need to hone it with a sharpening steel, and it will still go dull on you.  It&#8217;s only 7% harder than the average good knife and the Vanadium helps but isn&#8217;t going to change your life.If you just want a light knife with a thin spine, you can get the same thing for a quarter the money from a Forschner or some other industrial (F. Dick Pro-Dynamic or Messermeister Four Seasons, etc) If you want a light, razor sharp Japanese knife with a hard blade, you can get the same blade performance and a better handle for half the money from a Tojiro DP.4) If you're in the market for a Japanese knife and want a complete set of Eastern and Western shapes, your only real options are the Shun or the Globals.  I'd rather have a Hattori, but they don't make a bread knife, or a western boning knife, or a Chinese cleaver, or a paring knife (although the petty knives will do most of the same jobs).  But unless you're really attached to the idea of a matching set, buy this knife and the 3.5"" paring knife, and go industrial on the rest.  A $15 Forschner boning knife will spank the $90 Shun boning knife.  The same goes for the bread knife.  All pimpery aside, if you ask Alton Brown, he&#8217;ll tell you that a $100 bread knife is a waste of money (but he&#8217;ll still be more than happy to sell you one).5)  The 9"" Shun sharpening steel is too short for this knife.  Find a nice 12"" sharpening steel, or buy a 12"" fine ceramic steel.  The ceramic steel will take off metal, so if you don't really know how to use a steel, stick with metal; it's more forgiving of bad form.All that said, this is a good knife.  The edge is flawless, the steel is good, it&#8217;s pretty, it has a nice blade shape, and the price is reasonable.  If you like the hand-feel and don't have any trouble paying the mortgage, it will be money well spent.  But I still prep with my Forschner, and leave the 10&#8221; Shun on the strip next to the 10&#8221; Global and the 10&#8221; Wusthof to impress any foodies that happen to wander through my kitchen, and as a silent testament to Brown, Bourdain, and my dream that Rachel Ray will someday learn how to use a real knife.",0
3084,"rejuvinated our cat!. This product worked great for our 17 year old cat. Due to his increasing arthritis, we were concerned that we were going to have to put him to sleep soon to put him out of his misery. After being on this 2.5 months, he is back to normal. He still moves slow, but he's not in pain, and you would move slow too if you were 80+ years old! We highly recommend this.",0

The 6qt bowl will still mix small batches so don't think it's too big for everyday use. Red Cayenne color is much more durable and appealing over the Red (the pictures don't do it justice). And at amazon prices you really don't need to shop elsewhere...trust me I wasted alot of time trying,0

Theonly change to the coffeemaker I would like to see is that when the coffeemaker starts its a very startling noise.This coffeemaker to me is the best by far of other coffeemakers",0
3090,"Simple, cheap and FUN!. Both of my cats really love this and my wallet adores it because it's cheap as well as being on the fairly durable side as well. My cats are active (they love to play, run after and catch things) and like to play two or three times a day. As several other reviewers have noted, you should keep a light grip/pinch on one end and that's enough to make the other end swing and weave around in the air. Then, just roll your end between your fingertips a bit and it'll bounce a bit and swing around and  (hopefully) entice your kitties play with the other end. I've also held it in the middle and let both cats go at their seperate end but it's stiffer that way and doesn't move as much.Boo is about four and half years old and the other, Poxie, is three. Poxie will play with anything that moves (or is shiney and will chew carboard for the heck of it), so she loves it. Boo is a bit pickier likes to ""stalk"" things and be convinced that he really does want to play. I usually to drag this around and wiggle it on the floor a bit to catch his interest but he always comes around and will start batting at it in the air as well. Both will go wild if it wiggles (and makes noise), just barely visiable, from the edge of a cardboard box or paper bag though =)It holds up very well, they will pounce and chew on the cardboard and wire. The ends of the cardboard do fray a bit and get soggy but they're tightly coiled with the wire and it lasts a good amount of time. The price is great also, so no qualms about getting a new one very couple of months",0
3091,"A fantastic product. The pepper ans salt grinders are fabulous. Don't understand why it gets so many bad reviews! It works great, gives out as much crushed pepper as a regular small pepper mill does. And the pepper and salt coarseness are perfect too. Plus it is very handy unlike traditional mills where you have to rotate with both hands. Great product",0
3092,"Open sesame. This product is great. I was so tired of using other types of can openers, and I've tried them all. With the electric ones the cans would slip off and splash water all over the table. The manual ones also slip off and then I'd have to saw the rest of the lid off with a steak knife. Both types leave a very sharp lid. I've cut my fingers many times. The OneTouch solves all the problems associated with opening cans. You just place the One Touch on top of the can press the button and the One Touch does the rest. This can opener even leaves a lip on the top of the lid so you can close the can. Fantastic !",0

Take for instance the tops of milk bottles or the random sighting of a blind cord. You just never know what is going to catch a cats attention.This butterfly is one of the best cat toys I've found. It crinkles like a paper bag, but it is a durable piece of crinkly plastic in each wing. In the center, there is a ball of catnip and some filling.So far, this toy has held up miraculously well and I've even seen our cats toss it up in the air and pretend it is some bug they are chasing. Rather amusing.For even more fun, dip this toy in a bit of fresh catnip.~TheRebeccaReview.com",0

The timer 'beep' is plenty loud and continues to ring for 30 seconds until you stop it.  If you don't stop it, it will give you reminder beep every 10 seconds.One nice feature of this timer is the 'memory' function.  It allows you to set the timer back to the last setting with a simple press of the CLEAR/MEMORY button.Pro's:- Easy to set- Loud beeper (with reminder beeps)- Operates as a digital clock when not being used as a timer- Can be set from 1 second to 99 Hours 99 Minutes 99 Seconds- Timer can be paused if needed via START/STOP button- Compact size- 4 rubber non-skid feet keep timer firmly planted- Solidly builtCon's:- The 0..9 buttons are easy to push but the CLEAR/MEMORY andSTOP/START buttons are somewhat difficult to press.

You could do that, though, with an old bedspread, but this thing is nice. I got the gold, a very pretty soft color, and it makes my brand-new sofa look wonderful (while I'm trying to keep it looking wonderful longer in a house full of kids and animals - not including my husband.)So now that we're clear - it is NOT a slipcover - hopefully folks will recognize this for what it is, and buy it for that purpose (just make sure you've got a place to stash it quick.)When company comes, you'll look like you're the world's greatest housekeeper - or at the very least, your guests won't leave with a pet-hair coat on the seat of their pants.",0

More importantly, a DEMANDING basset hound that constantly tries forcing me to not walk, but RUN with him, whenever we go for a walk.I was afraid when purchasing this retractable leash, that the cord would not be strong enough to hold up over time, and that the cord would probably rip out the minute the dog spots a rabbit or another dog and takes off running.  But so far, three years later, it hasn't happened.This leads me to conclude that this leash is a wonderful purchase.  Oh, and the fact that there's a handle located conveniently for you to hold is another bonus.  I mean, come on, the handle fits in your hand nice and snug.  Good leash.  I highly recommend it.",0

When my wife concluded her extensive search for a replacement to our old canister vacuum and anointed Miele the winner, I was slightly less enthusiastic than she.  It's a vacuum cleaner.  It's just a tool for keeping things trim.After a very short while I began to understand her admiration for the design and build quality of this particular tool.  The HEPA filters and bags used are no less a part of this than is the vacuum itself.  If you tire of vacuums that are constantly gritty with the dust they stir-up but don't quite capture, get a Miele.  If you distain the smell emanating from your vacuum's exhaust, get a Miele.  If you long for a simple, easy to use and maintain system that even your husband will use, get a Miele.Use genuine Miele bags, and change your HEPA filter as recommended.

3121,"My kitchen workhorse -- expensive but so worth it!!!. This is by far the most-used item in my kitchen.  Think about it:  If you could increase your cooking surface area when browning meat or vegetables or cooking soup, chili or spaghetti sauce, wouldn't you do so?  This dutch oven does exactly that.  I use it to brown everything--I rarely use my (very fine All-Clad) chef's skillet any more.  And I actually love the high sides--they reduce spatters without reducing browning, since the cast iron almost guarantees perfect browning.  This is a great pan if you need to develop fond--nothing burns in this pan once you get it up to temperature.  I actually have 3 Le Creuset dutch ovens in varying sizes, but I end up using this big one most of the time.  Come on--you know you want it.  Buy it",0

3125,pleased. I am very pleased with the Chemire Dinnerware Set.  It is very durable and the colors are great.  The dishes are larger than I had expected.  They are a little heavy due to the size and thickness.  I would recommend them to others,0
3126,"Love that Thumper. This will be the third Thumper I've bought.  Lost the first one on a trip, second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift.  It's simple to use, loud enough to wake you and doesn't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes.  The thumper pad is big enough to hit when you're groggy!  More products should be as easy to live with as this one!",0
3127,Rival Crock Pot. I love this crock pot!!  I've made several recipes from the enclosed cook book - they came out great.  The best part is that the ceramic insert is so easy to clean,0

The same comments apply to both.]This coat rack is not as nice as one we got in England, which unfortunately toppled and broke after 10 years' service, but it is functional and my husband likes it.The British one had rounded, solid hooks and NO plastic. This version is a bit more like a cheap imitation, with bentwood hooks and a plastic umbrella holder.But it was a good compromise when I could not find a top quality replacement, and for the price it was well worth trying out. (But you do get what you pay for!)So far it works ok but ask me again in winter when it's laden with heavy coats",0

My wife has not stopped using the knives!  She claims they are the sharpest knives she's ever used and has warned me SEVERAL times to be careful when using.  They're lightweight and tough.  They keep an edge and are fantastic for slicing, chopping or cutting.  I found out about them from a wife of a friend who said the same thing!  They're definitely worth the expense.  And to my wife - keep on chopping and cooking baby, I'll eat every bite!",0
3143,"Worth The Price!!. This is the coolest thing I've ever bought for under $20. You have to be sure it's sitting on a flat surface or the chocolate won't flow evenly. The motor made a sad little sound when we first started it up so, I can't give it 5 stars but, I know I read in other reviews somewhere that you have to run a bit of vegetable oil in it first before you pour the chocolate in.  Regardless, the sound goes away after the chocolate's been flowing for awhile.The clean up was extra sweet and messy...I didn't mind it.  Also, I did have to get back online and read some other reviews to find out how other people remedied the oil in the chocolate.  Another reason why it didn't get 5 stars.  The recipe in the manual made our chocolate too smooth. When you dipped a strawberry in it, it didn't harden fast enough. Thank goodness they sent a 10% off coupon on quality chocolate. The other remedy may be less oil in the chocolate.Other reviewers said it was gross but, it tasted just fine to us. Come on, it's chocolate!! It's already bad for you!Still, this is a big hit and totally worth the money. I will be looking into better chocolate NOT a better fountain. This one is GREAT",0
3144,"so far so good. PEACE AT LAST!!!!! We have only had this for 4 days, but we are very happy. I ordered this because of RUDE neighbors who leave there 2 dogs(who bark and bark and.... they don't stop) out 24/7 is a dog run outside our bedroom window. Other neigbors have complained as well, they still won't do anything. After setting up the bark stop it didn't take long before they got the idea, they get 1 or 2 barks out then nothing :) I called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs ""trying to bark"" I told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it, she thought that was great.( now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard)update 10/18 okay the real test came last night and again this morning.What was the test?? SIRENS!!! I just had to laugh, they couldn't bark and howl!!! All I heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them. I am so glad we bought this!!!!",0

Not sure if the kettle on this is bigger than Presto's other gem the Kitchen Kettle, but if it's the same as that, then this is a great addition to have for the kitchen. Great for soups, stews, steaming, deep fry cooking, lots of other cooking applications. Easy to clean, easy to use thermostat on the cord. Haven't gone wrong with the Kitchen Kettle, so I feel this version should be of the same high quality as well.",0
3146,"Premium toast. Tried 3 other toasters in 6 months. Uneven toasting, broken knobs, you name it. This little gem is great at making even toast and also a fine bagel. Only takes a few days to get aquainted with the settings. It also looks great and doesn't eat half the counter. Very pleased",0
3147,"A Great Machine. After getting poor results from a steam driven Krups I decided to give home espresso brewing another try with a pump driven machine. After many days of research I settled on the Villaware Moderno. In addition to good reviews it was the only pump machine in this price range that did not have a boxy, or plastic look.All in all I a very happy with my purchase. The machine heats up fast, its easy to use and the foamer is fool proof. I steamed half and half for my cappucino and got mountains of very stable foam on the first try! For espresso I used the Illy pods that came with it and got very satisfactory results. The espresso was plenty hot and had a moderate amount of crema. But I understand that you get less crema anyway if you use pods. The hot water dispensing feature also works fine. I dispense the hot water into a large pyrex measuring cup for preheating the espresso cups.Some things worth mentioning. Cleaning: In addition to washing everything with soapy water, I ran 4 tanks of water through the system before I could get rid of that ""metallic smell"". Definately run water through the steam nozzle before using it. I noticed little particles of stuff coming out in the rinse water. Dripping: yes the portafilter does drip after you stop brewing but I shove a shot glass under the spout after I remove the cup and no problem.",0
3148,"as good as the full-size steamer. I compared this travel model with the full-size J-2000 steamer.  They were both very good at removing wrinkles from business-type clothing.  We steamed a full week's wardrobe, and the clothing done with the travel steamer looked just as good as the others.  The only drawback to the travel model is related to its small size - it needs to be refilled every 3-6 garments, and the smaller steam head means that it takes longer to steam an item.  However, I actually found that the small steam head worked better on small areas like collars and cuffs, especially since it has squared corners.  The corners mean that you do have to be a bit careful with delicate knits, though.  Worth the price if you really need to look your best when you travel",0
3149,So glad we bought this fence. I had my doubts that this fence would work for us.we have 2 large rotties and I didnt think it would contain them.The collars make a beeping sound that warns the dog to get back before any shock happens. I am amazed our dogs will not cross the border and if they hear the beep they run backwards in fear.I would say the amount of shock the dog receives seems a little harsh but it really puts the message across. We also like the fact that you can adjust the amount of area depending on our needs,0

3154,"Great, but... I needed a saucepan to cook oatmeal in that would let go on the bits that stick to the bottom.  Sounds silly, but I love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards.  This cleans up easily and cooks evenly.  I have used it for cooking rice, gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well.  Now, for the lid.  There is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently.  I sat down, wrote an email to the company and by the next day, they have a new lid on the way.  They asked only where to send it, nothing else.  I like companies that stand by the product they sell.  So, if you are going to buy from this line, check that black band, it should be between the glass and the metal, not on the inside of the lid.  If you have a problem with the product, ALWAYS notify the manufacturer, they will almost always make it right, like Calphalon did for me",0

One small problem is that there is a space between the cooking unit and the base unit which allows food to spill through.The biggest concern I have to pass on is that this unit is really BIG. The description mentions that the cooking surface is 13.7"", but does not mention that the base unit is 18.5"" wide, so make sure you have a space to store it. I had to store mine in my oven",0
3157,"Hamilton Beach Indoor Grill with Removable Grill & Timer. This was an excellent purchase.  The grids are removable and go right in the dishwasher without any impact to the non-stick coating.  It has an audible timer which also shuts off the grill making it a great purchase for the elderly who might not hear the timer.  This is the second time we've purchased the grill, we gave the first grill to our son after we'd used it for a couple of years (it was still like new and we'd used it a lot).  We called around our local area looking for another HB grill and couldn't find one so we purchased a George Foreman.  The features we were looking for, especially the timer that shut the grill off, were only available on the larger grills.  We're cooking for two and really didn't want the ""family size"" grill so we left it in the box and pursued the HB until we found one on Amazon.  We're now happy grillers again and hope they never stop making the HB with the features we love",0

They slice through so easily and with no mashing of whatever you're trying to slice.  They do need an occasional sharpening, but that little bit of effort is well worth it.  Also, the knife extends all the way to the end of the handle, so it won't seperate from the blade or break like so many others have...especially while trying to slice through hard cheeses.  Excellent knife.  You really don't need a whole set though, as one serated and one straight would be sufficient",0

As an apartment dweller with a small kitchen, this pan is ideal: it is easy to store and has multiple purposes.

3163,"Time to clean up the house. Before I bought a Dirt Devil, I owned a vacuum that worked great for over 5 years.  In January I broke that vacuum on a Friday the 13th (yes, that really is a bad day) thanks to me accidentally ramming the front of it into the side of the living room coffee table.  After it hit the table I knew immediately it was a goner.  Sometimes you just know.  Also, the electrical smoke shooting out the front was another good indication.  No one to blame but me.  It actually upset me because, before that innocent, everyone in my house kept accusing me of knocking a big dent into the side of the dishwasher in the kitchen.  I really believe I didn't put that dent there, and I tried hard to defend myself every time that topic came up, but now I look incredibly guilty because of the way I knocked the vacuum into the coffee table and ruined it.  I'm an innocent man!  I DID NOT BANG THE VACUUM INTO THE DISHWASHER!And the worst part about that vacuum breaking was that I was actually DONE cleaning the floors before it broke, and so I shut the vacuum off, but then (and this will bother me forever) I looked down on the carpet and realized that I had missed a spot near the coffee table, so I turn the vacuum back on and THEN I accidentally hit the coffee table and destroyed the vacuum.  If I had never bothered with that spot on the floor the vacuum probably would continue to run fine today. A mistake I have to live with.After it was discovered that we couldn't save the vacuum cleaner, we went somewhere to get another one (actually I stayed home while my dad shopped around).  For years we saw commercials for Dirt Devils and figured they would be a very wise purchase.  Well, that turned out to be not entirely true, but in another way, it WAS entirely true.  Let me try to explain why I think this is a good vacuum cleaner.  I have to warn you- it's kind of mind-boggling.The one big complaint people seem to have with Dirt Devils also happened to me- one time I was vacuuming, and I left it running while I was busy trying to arrange the dog beds across the floor in a way I could easily vacuum over them.  Well, while I was doing that the vacuum was positioned on top of the cord, and so it accidentally sucked up the cord, made a big scary noise, and damaged it.  I immediately ran over and unplugged it.  I had to wrap electrical tape around the spot on the cord that was damaged because the wires inside were exposed.  This happened after the second week we purchased it, and I thought I was going to freak out because I thought I had just ruined a brand new vacuum.  It turned out to be okay.  Truly a scary moment.  That was a sign to just take the dog beds outside for now on and shake the hair off myself.I like how Dirt Devil vacuums have a plastic case design to hold the dirt and hair, instead of messing with those darn vacuum bags.  Vacuum bags are a pain in the butt because not all types are designed the same.  For instance, one time I bought a 3-pack bag of vacuum bags that had a round hole on top of the bag, but the inside of my vacuum at home required bags with a SQUARE hole, so we had to go back to the store and search for vacuum bags that were created with square-shaped holes instead of round-shaped holes, so it would fit inside my vacuum.  A big, unnecessary pain.  ALL BAGS SHOULD HAVE EITHER ROUND OR SQUARE HOLES, NOT BOTH.Anyway, with the Dirt Devils plastic container design, you can simply push a button to remove the container from the vacuum cleaner and empty the dirt and hair into your trashcan/front yard, and use a brush to wipe away any sticky remains.  No bags needed.  This is convenient, but if there's one complaint it's that the container fills up after vacuuming the entire downstairs after only ONE time (this includes the kitchen, living room and den floors- but I DO have a big house).As I mention above, something very strange is going on with my Dirt Devil.  When I first bought the vacuum back in January I thought the sucking power was sort of weak, and I had to go over certain areas on my carpet three or four times to completely clean it.  However, as the weeks went by, the sucking power gradually increased to where now I'm afraid to leave the vacuum turned on over any kind of loose rugs, for fear that the vacuum cleaner will suck the rug right off the floor.  I have no idea where this sudden burst of amazing power came from, and why it's getting stronger as time goes on.  I don't know if I'm happy about it either.  I think I am.   You just have to be careful not to leave the vacuum running over any kind of rug or doormat.All I hope for is that my Dirt Devil vacuum lasts me until the end of this year.  I can't handle the frustration of buying vacuum after vacuum not ONLY because of a money issue, but also because you know how people can be- they will continue to say *I* destroyed my vacuums by accusing me of being exceptionally harsh with them- accusing me of pushing around my vacuums aggressively and angrily, banging into the side of everything I come into contact with.  I'm really not the kind of person that does that.  These people can just knock it off.  Okay, sometimes I break out into hives and get extremely itchy, and during these moments it's hard to push the vacuum around calmly and carefully.  But I've learned to just shut the vacuum off and wait for the itching to go away before starting it back up again.So there's really not much for me to complain about when it comes to Dirt Devils.  Okay, so sometimes if you vacuum over cracker crumbs or something the crumbs will shoot back and hit your leg.  But please, don't tell me that actually hurts you.  It's doing that because the vacuum is so damn powerful.  It can't help it!  It's a great vacuum for dog hair.  On hard floors, the Dirt Devil is a pretty quick and wonderful experience, too.  Dog hair is gone in an instant.  The noise of the motor is louder than most, this is true.  That's a slight problem.  But I only need to vacuum once a week so it's not like I have to hear the thing running everyday.  The noise would probably become a problem then.  But in the end, my experience for the last three months with the Dirt Devil has been a good one.",0
3164,T-Fal Avante Toaster. We have one of these in each of our 19 kitchens and we like them very much,0
3165,"Designed to be a vacuum you don't have to fight with. The light weight, compact design makes the Miele vacuum cleaner highly maneuverable. It can be easily picked up and moved up and down stairs. When you move about the room, you don't have to drag it around like a dead weight, a gentle tug and the main motor unit follows along effortlessly.It doesn't have a motor-driven carpet brush. At first, I thought it would be a disadvantage, after all, that's a standard feature on most of the American vacuum cleaners. But now I see the logic behind it. The standard floor tool is lighter and easier to move around. Its joint swivels in two directions making it easier to get into corners and under furnitures. The hose also doesn't have embedded electrical cable making it more flexible. For our carpet, the standard floor tool works well enough. The manual does recommend getting the battery powered electro-brush if really deep pile carpet or rug neccesitates it.The motor is powerful yet very quiet.Overall, this is a excellent cleaning tool that makes vacuuming less of a chore",0
3166,"Everything they say. These are great. The color and the cost. My family thinks they make the room look so modern. They don't look cheap but they are light enough for me (female, 5'5"" 130) to move with one hand. I slide them under the dining room table, instead of using chairs. This is a great space saver if you live in a smaller apt or house",0

3169,"Great cookie sheets. I have lived in Europe recently and was unable to use my jelly roll pans and cookie sheets because of the standard size of the ovens there.  I purchased these because they would easily fit their ovens.  I used them at Christmas and was thrilled at how the cookies came out.  I have never used a cookie sheet that cooked such as to have the cookies literally sliding off the cookie sheet without any nudge.  If you have a gas oven I would suggest watching the first batch to see the actual time you need in.  I accidentally browned the bottom a little too much the first batch.  They are more weighty than my other cookie sheets, but that is their only draw back.  A true find for the frequent baker",0
3170,"A Superior Set. This is hands down the best set of knives I have ever owned. This is my second set of Henckel Knives, the first having walked out of my house one afternoon.Nearly any new knife will seem very sharp. The real question is how long will they keep an edge? These knives retain their sharpness quite well. The carbon steel used is quite good and utterly smooth. The body of the blade is the appropriate thickness for the task. That is some are thinner and more flexible, like the boning knife while others are thicker and more solid, like the chef's knife.Of course you will need to sharpen knives periodically. I recommend sending them to a professional knife sharpener or, if you are so inclined and skilled, use a specially designed kitchen knife sharpening jig. Remember, dull knives are more dangerous than sharp ones because you use more force and thus are more likely to slip. A chef's knife is sharp enough when it can cut well into meat by simply drawing it across using only the weight of the knife (it should not catch). The ""cutting a sheet of paper"" trick is just that, a trick and not a good indicator of sharpness.While the set does include a sharpening bar, I find these require some skill and practice in order to get a both good edge and keep your own blood inside your body.All knives, including the steak knives have a wonderful balance and handle shape. I have had no trouble with my hand slipping onto the blade. I have medium sized hands and fit well. I also find the handle design to be handsome.The variety of knives in this set is good, something for nearly every task. I particularly like the large chef's knife and extra small paring knife.The steak knives are nice in that the upper half and tip have small serrations while the lower half is a smooth blade.I like the fact that you get both long and short serrated bread knives.The video that came with my set was well done and quite helpful.Like any knife set, for long life you should not put these in the dishwasher. It is not that the knives cannot somehow tolerate being immersed in hot water, no. Rather it is simply impossible to prevent something else from hitting blades. That would result in premature wear and harm the actual razor-thin cutting edge. But then this caution applies to all knives so this is not really a limitation of this set.Though you may be tempted, you should not try to chop firewood with these knives as this will lead to premature wear",0
3171,"Cooks everything perfectly!. After being disappointed with GE and Black and Decker toaster ovens, I spent a little more and got this Cuisinart.  It is the best toaster oven hands down.

This toaster oven actually crisps them, they don't come out cooked but mushy like they did in my other ones.You can cook 3 bagels at a time as well as small pizzas.

I am sorry now that I didn't add a cover to my order, thought my Calphalon covers might work, haven't found a good match for this size pan so keep that in mind if you do buy.  This will be used as I have traditionally used this size, it will fry, it will make pineapple upside down cake, it will turn out a perfect meatloaf.

3174,"Best Book Lights We've Tried!. First, in the interest of full disclosure, I am writing this review under my husband's ""real name"" because it's his account.My husband and I are avid readers and we often read in bed before falling asleep. As such, we've looked at and tried just about every book light on the market.We initially found these lights by chance at a Costco, sitting by themselves (the only package available) on top of a stack of books. We tried them out and they were fantastic. Most book lights had one of two features we liked, and a lot more that we didn't. These were just what we wanted.They are lightweight.They are very, very bright.The battery is easy to change.The light bulbs have never needed to be replaced.They are compact and don't weigh down a paperback.The clip is strong and stays in place.Best of all is the swivel. You can direct these lights anywhere you need them, left/right, up/down, all around. Plus you can direct the arm that holds the lights to various angles. It's perfect for night-time or car/air travel reading.Someone said it's hard to find batteries for the lights. We've never had that problem. Target and WalMart carry an extensive supply (I think they are 2032, we get Duracell and Energizer brands and they last a long time). Very easy to replace, just unscrew the back of the light and pop them in.I will say the first lights we got in that original two-pack from Costco (we have never seen them at the store again, it was such a fluke) did have a problem with one of the two lights. One of the batteries always gets stuck and is next to impossible to remove. We end up unscrewing the other half of the light where the bulbs are and pushing the battery out the other side. This is obviously not intended to be the way to change the battery. HOWEVER this has NEVER happened with the lights we've bought from this company through Amazon - only one one of the first two we got at Costco, and I'm not even sure they were made by the same people, although they look identical.Since buying that first two-pack, we've bought four more lights from this company at Amazon. My husband and I keep them in various locations of the house, in our travel bags, in the car, etc., and get constant use out of them. They are durable, and long lasting.Only one thing I have a complaint about: the claw-clip is supposed to open using a thumb-press movement, but I find it difficult to use. It's easily worked around just by opening it with my fingers and attaching it to the book. Maybe I have small hands, my husband doesn't have this problem. It's a minor issue, though.Finally, I love the colors. Pink, blue, and purple especially. They just make you happy to look at, but maybe that's just me. :",0
3175,"Built like a tank. The huge motor gives this machine an ability to almost grind rocks! The grind setting knob is huge and easy to read. The coffee bin seems immune to that darn static cling. The bean hopper is generous in size also. The instruction book, yes, a real book, tells you how to not only clean the machine well but also how to change the grinding range for anything imaginable. Even the operating noise is much less than expected. When I compared the price of this machine vs the metallic finished Pro-Lines, I find it obvious that Ferrari Red is the way to go",0

I have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie I keep looking for the combination of simplicity, cost and excellent coffee - this has all three!The first two or three times I tried this the coffee didn't come out that good, either too weak or not enough body but now I have it down and the coffee is excellent. I make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day.The other good news... I've now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker - it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature  to use in the aeroexpress.",0

You don't even realize it's doing anything until it's not working (it does require water to work). It's that unobtrusive! The smellkiller is GREAT and I would recommend it to anyone. I plan on giving these as gifts! While it's not like you'll never have odor in your house again (seems to me some people have that outrageous expectation of this product) it will make a noticable difference. Go ahead and buy it. Cheaper in the long run than air freshners,0

3181,"Coffee Maker that Rocks!. After much research and consideration I decided to buy this product as a Christmas gift for my husband.  I am not the type of person to research products before I buy them, but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso (and being Cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth--makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines), I did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations. I have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it.  My main concern was how HOT the coffee would be, and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee.  I've read reviews about the noise it makes, and after having the Deloghi product, the noise this machine makes when warming up is NOT that loud at all.  We are very happy with it.  Buy it, you'll be happy too",0
3182,"The Best Grill On The Market. The grill is so capable that I sold our gas grill at a garage sale!  I purchased 2 of these for myself in blue, and one for my mother in red.  She was delighted. I use one for beef, fish, poultry and the other at the same time for veggies, etc.  It is exceptionally well-made, (guaranteed for 101 years) - and the weight of the grill reflects it's quality.  If you have weak wrists or if lifting anything heavy is a problem - unfortunately - this wouldn't be for you.  Also, it is more difficult to clean then any of my other Le Creuset pieces; however, no more trouble to clean, then the rack from our gas grill.  In fact, less so as it's smaller and fits into the sink more easily; simply let it soak for a bit in warm water and it's no trouble.  I use mine at least 3 times a week, and am only sorry I didn't purchase it sooner.  I highly recommend it",0
3183,"The Best Popcorn!. This is the best popcorn popper ever! It's easy, really fast and fun. Every kernel pops up light and fluffy. We used the pre-measured movie theater packs and we think the popcorn tastes better than what we get at the movies. We also popped a store bought corn and it also popped up light and fluffy with no kernels unpopped. We are not fans of microwave popcorn and we usually popped in a pot on the stove. The Whirley-pop makes a better popcorn and is so much faster and easier because of the material it is made of and the way the steam is vented. We love it and never have a problem eating the full batch.",0

After washing, they feel just like regular pillow cases and are quite cool to the touch, which I like, since my face and feet always get too warm while I sleep.I purchased the standard size cases and didn't realize I had jumbo pillows, but they still fit, they are just a bit fat, so it is nice that the size isn't made to be perfectly small.",0

So I checked out bamboo utensils and found these very nice and reasonably priced tools.First, they are great with all types of cookware, whether traditional or nonstick.  And the burnished bamboo surface is very tough.  It doesn't mind high heat or the dishwasher.I also like the bamboo container.  It's small enough to place anywhere in the kitchen.

It really does fold down flat and stores easily.I also want to add that Amazon shipped it in a big box with lots of air pockets, so there was no damage to the product as other people have complained about, so Amazon is listening!  Thanks! (April 2007",0

Very pleased with the new toaster so far; wish it wasn't so ""fat"" on my counter, but it is eye-pleasing, light weight  and fairly quiet; the only disappointment for me was that the english muffins, for example, do not pop up high enough to grab them without having to ""go in"" and  burning your fingers if you are not careful; ""they"" had said that this particular model had a higher ""carriage"" so this would not happen, but it does.Otherwise, great little fat red bug.Price was excellent with no shipping fees or tax from Amazon",0

Personally I would upgrade to the bigger pitcher unless you only drink true doppio macchiato's (the drinks in the tiny cups). I am a Starbucks Barista and know when I see a quality product and this definately meets my standards. Good product, just stupid buyer :)",0

3203,"Peace at last!. I had so many barking dogs that I was feeling like shooting them. My rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog's disruption of the neighborhood (some kind of power thing I guess). When ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill. When my last short term renter (a pastor) yelled NO! at them I became desperate. I had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs. I was looking for a new collar (cironella) I plugged in anti bark, and then up popped this Super Bark Product. I bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree. The dogs barked the entire time right at the fence, until my daughter turned it on. They ran like bats out of hell back to their house and haven't been heard since! Now I was a little sceptical at first, but I can't praise this product enough. You can not get anything else that will do this for you. You can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win. If you move, you might end up with more barking. Look. It's worth the money, believe me!!!!",0

The ""dial"" on this unit replaces the standard touch pad found on most microwaves and is extremely effective and easy to use. Turn it fast for ""minutes"" and turn it slow for ""seconds.""

3208,"CDN Proaccurate Digital Programmable Probe Thermometer. After much research into these devices, I decided to purchase the CDN brand for my husband as a gift.  I chose this brand since it had a higher temperature range than that of the other brands available.  This one goes up to 482degrees.  So far he seems to love this thermometer.  It seems very accurate in reading the internal temp of the meats.  He loves that it allows him to program what type of meat and for beef the taste(rare,m.rare,med,well). The cable connecting the device to the probe seems to be pretty strong--braided wire. I have seen other devices by other brands that the cables ""burn out"".  This was one of the deciding factors in purchasing the CDN brand. My husband loves the magnetic feature that allows him to stick it to the side of the oven!  I am also excited to see the thermometer comes with a clip for candy making and frying.  I havent had a chance to use it for this purpose yet, but it makes the device much more versatile & useful.  The temperature display is quite large and easy to read...so it will work good for someone who cant read small print.  I would actually give this product 4 &1/2 stars.  The only reasons I would deduct half a star are: 1)the casing is plastic (cannot use on BBQ)and 2)the timer beeper isnt that loud (you cant hear it if upstairs or more than a room away, so you need to stay in earshot to hear the timer go off).  All in all its a great product.  I would recommend it.  Buy it and you will never have dried out or undercooked meat again.  Its well worth it!  The chef in your life will thank you",0
3209,Fast and convenient cooking. I bought this grill to make lefse but so far I have only used it for tortillas and pancakes. It works wonderfully and cooks 4 -5 pancakes or tortillas at a time. I can cook them in less than half the time it took using a skillet on the stove. It has been easy to clean too. Now I all I need to do is find the time to make lefse,0
3210,"Good enough for the time being!. I am the worlds biggest procrastinator when it comes to putting together furniture!  I bought this piece, along with the desk, in January and here it is April, and I am just now getting the job done.  The table part of this product was fairly easy to put together and at this point my spirits were high.  The file drawer on the other hand is a different story.  None of the pieces are labeled, getting the two sides and the front to align long enough to put the screws was almost impossible and I did need to use a hammer to fishish off the screws.  I liked to never figure out why my drawer was not sitting right, when I finally figured it out that I had it in on the wrong side.  Overall, putting it together could have been made easier with written directions instead of just pictures, screws that actually screwed all the way in and pieces that are labled.  The file cart is a little wobbly but seems to be sturdy enough to hold my printer...for the time being",0
3211,"very good. It works well, probably better than the other solutions available, but there are some disadvantages: there are 2 LEDs that illuminate the page, and illumination is not perfectly uniform. How could it be? In addition, a faint diffraction pattern resulting in concentric circles or arcs radiating out from the LEDs is visible on the page. Finally, because the ""lens"" is made of plastic, it accumulates static electricity and hence dust; pages actually stick to my lightwedge",0
3212,"great skillet. i really like the electric skillet, it is the first one, i have bought. it is big enough to fry a chicken cut in half,both halves at once, and deep enough to make a stew. easy to clean just like promised. the only thing i was not so happy about was the handles. they give a lot, they bend, and one of mine is already broken. but that is really the only complain i have and i consider it a minor and would buy the skillet again",0

I use it mainly for condiments and spices besides the stove, but also on the table for the little bowls with sauces and supplements that go with fondue, Mexican or East Indian dishes. In that case I appreciate the lip which holds things back from sliding all over the table, especially when eating with kids (or spirited guests).In general: a lazy susan is not meant to get in contact with food directly (improvise with the glass tray from your microwave, it's easy to clean). And in a fridge or kitchen cabinet corner your susan needs a lip, otherwise small things disappear forever..",0
3220,"This is IT!. My mother had one of these saucepans and used it daily as far back as I can remember for everything from boiling potatoes to making gravy.  When she passed away I took it and use it all the time.  It came witha double boiler insert which also got (and gets) frequest use, particularly for melting chocolate.

3233,"Easy, Fun, Delish !!. The smell of the roasting coffee is just the beginning of the great experience with this roaster. Easy to use and a snap to clean. I use a digital scale to measure the quantity going in (the volume measurements varies according to the beans, so do it by weight. Bravi instructions are 225 mg; No more No less.)The smoke during roasting is part of the process. Putting the roaster under my kitchen hood handles that.  The most fun is having guests watch it happen. Most have never seen/heard (yes, you hear the bean cracking)coffee roasting. A conversation starter for sure! During the automatic cool down, the kitchen smells wonderful (the aromas seem to improve during cool-down). Then, get ready for a GREAT coffee experience. I set my digital roast level to 15, and get the right color for my taste. When grinding, I only grind enough for immediate use. Also, for some reason, the grounds of my home roasted beans seem to 'fluff up' about 20%, so I have to cut down the quantity of ground coffee I brew (usually I use 1.5-2 Tbs per cup) so the grounds don't expand beyond the filter (I use a drip machine). The dark rich brew and fresh taste from home roasting is unlike any other experience I've had with coffee. To help make sure your Bravi is ready to roast, you need to be sure you have cleaned up any beans and chaff from previous roastings. Clean the chaff collection pull-out dish to avoid smoke from burning. Also, brush off the surface under the bean collector bin. (If a bean is left under the bin, the Bravi may not sense it is closed and ready, and not start.)Great experience and I recommend the Bravi to anyone",0

This 6-3/4 Quart Oval French Oven weighs at least 14 lbs, & I think the weight & quality is obviously part of the appeal. But, if you have a ""bad back"", or are ""downsizing"" & packing to move, as I am, the weight can turn into a negative. Also, you should check around for price--I'm pretty sure Amazon had these at a much lower price a week or 2 ago, & there also good deals on the main online auction site.

It is a bit of a pain but I've found that a bottle cleaner with just a sponge tip--NO SCRUBBER-IT SCRATCHES--works just fine.  I put the funnel in the dishwasher about once a month.

3244,"Great product - love it. I got mine for Christmas in 2004 (older model) and I love it.  I have only used it to make 1 mug, so I'm not sure how it performs making 2.  I liked the mugs that came with it, and they fit easily in my car cup holder (I have a Toyota Celica).  I've since lost both mugs, but it wasn't hard finding replacements that fit under it.  The coffee is more than hot enough for me, I usually have to wait about 20-30 min for it to cool down enough (I am not one to order coffee extra hot at Starbucks).  I usually turn it on in the morning after getting ready, but before I am ready to walk out the door.  By the time I have fed the dog, gotten my things together, packed lunch, etc, I can pick up the mug and be ready to go. I have no idea how long it actually takes to brew, I'm always doing other things. On average, I'd say I use it about 5 times a week, and it still works great after 2+ years of continuous use",0
3245,Best vacuum ever!. This is a wonderful little machine - extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver but with AMAZING suction power! It also has a feature to quickly and easily lessen that power with a quick flip of a small tab to easily vacuum blinds and curtains.  Lots of great attachments.  I absolutely love this little vacuum cleaner.  Plus the filter makes it easy to quickly empty and you don't have to mess with bags.  I love it!  I give it 2 thumbs up,0
3246,"Very good for knives. This holder for 12 knives does exactly what I want it to do. Safely transport very sharp knives back and forth to my church culinary chores without taking a chunk out of an unsuspecting colleague. I give it only four stars because it doesn't seem quite as good as some similar products I've seen on various Food Network documentaries, which seem to easily carry things which are a lot less flat than the average knife.But, if the price is right and carrying knives is what you want, get this product, it is especially good at being stiff, avoiding the risk of pushing a sharp tip out at you at an awkward moment",0

Some people may prefer some forged blades from another name brand, Henckels' premium line, but for the price, this set includes everything anyone would need to start a collection.If you are concerned about the handles being too slick, they are meaty enough to fill your hand and I have not had any trouble holding on.  Just be sure to keep them clean, honed, and sharp and they will melt through even the most stringy chicken breast",0

Not only does it pump enough air to run a 3in bubble disk, and a 6in bubble wand, but it does so with so much power that I actually have my splitter set to only 3/4 power!And, as amazing as it may seem, it does all this - silently! I've used the big blue rounded pumps before, and they are silent for a while, but then get unbearably loud. I've been running this pump non-stop for months, and it hasn't increased in sound level at all.

I recently have found a great hot wings sauce (Ken's) and have been using my true-blue multi-cooker as a fryer, and it is working out great.   I just love this thing.  It is easy to clean up.  It's light and easy to handle.   It heats up quickly and has had no technical problems.   I love being able to tell what temperature I am cooking on (can set degrees - not just high medium or low temps) and be able to see through the glass lid at how the contents are doing.

Often these types of convection ovens can be noisy, not so in this case.  It also is a rather nice look machine and the company that sent me the oven was excellent.The reasons for not giving it 5 stars are that the inside is not as big as I would have liked, but it still is a fairly decent size.  I also think that the control panel is a pain to set up.  Not difficult, but I guess I am just used to using dials.  Overall a good oven and the company that sent was also excellent to deal with",0

I like the fan .It does circulate the air when pointed to ceiling and makes the room cool. It is also kinda quite.It does make the air circulating sound but it not noisy but pleasant. The only thing my wife didnt like is the black color of the fan. they could make it in different colors. It doesnt have any remote controls or oscillation like the other fancy fans have. But overall we like the fan very much and it performs as mentioned and i would recommend buying it,0

3264,Fabulous. I really enjoy using these tidbit trays. They are great when you just want to have one item on your tray.  They even work really well eating a bowl of cereal in bed.

It keeps eating time much much cleaner,0

After 3 months of use, the heater is starting to make little creaking noises, but is still working fine.The only down side to this heater is the metal surface gets really hot so we will have to be careful once he starts crawling and walking",0
3269,"You can't screw up coffee with this one... I received this as a gift from my sister.  First off, you must know that both my sister and I are ""coffee snobs"", meaning we really enjoy the taste of a good quality coffee.  Every previous coffee pot I have owned never made a good cup of coffee, and if it did, I don't know what formula was used to make it.  I tried every which way, adjusting bean amount, grind, etc, to no avail.  Coffee always had a bitter taste.The first pot I brewed in this one was absolutely perfect, and so was every one after that!  Excellent taste and quality.  I also found out that I can actually use a lot less coffee with this machine, and still get the strong, full bodied ""Starbucks"" flavor that I like.For those who complained about the temperature of the coffee, I have to agree to some extent.  On cold mornings, I must prime the coffeepot in order to produce a hot coffee.  That is only because of the hot coffee entering into a freezing cold metal pot!  It has nothing to do with the brewing process or temperature.  I also noticed someone actually commented that the heating element is barely warm to the touch.  That is because there IS NO HEATING ELEMENT!!!  The stainless pot is what retains the heat in the coffee.  Just make sure to prime your pot if you like it hot!All in all, this is a fantastic machine that brews a high quality cup of coffee",0

3272,"8"" chef works well. Since I was planning to spend a few days in a commercial kitchen, and my 6"" Henckels knives are both embarrassingly small for serious work and embarrassingly dull because I'm too lame to sharpen them, I decided to grab the 8"" chef's knife (at Bed, Bath & Beyond, with a 20% off coupon.)It worked extremely well for all the tasks I set it to today, including mincing parsley and chiffonading mint as well as the usual cutting tasks.  Despite its shallow curve (I strongly prefer knives whose edges are mostly straight, rather than the curved French style) the blade rocked very well for mincing, and was flat enough to cut completely through the rolled mint leaves in one short stroke.  Furthermore, the sharpness impressed the other people who used it, though we shall have to see if it can be REsharpened to the same degree.The handle design is clearly not for everyone, but I found it very comfortable when I held the knife as many cooks do, with the back end of the blade pinched between thumb and forefinger(s).  In particular, most knife handles/bolsters seem to be designed for people who grip knives solely by their handles but the integrated bolster made it feel *right* to grip knife at the blade.  The handle *seems* to be just the right weight to balance the blade, but I'll reserve judgment on whether it actually IS that well-balanced until I've spent more than a few hours using it.I'm impressed enough with the 8"" chef that I'm considering getting the block set, which includes the chef and a paring knife (I have no idea if the handle design will work well for that, though) as well as three other not-entirely-useless knives: 5.5"" serrated, 6"" utility, 5"" santoku (which probably would have been great for the chiffonade.)   I must admit a 6"" chef is probably marginally more useful than a 6"" utility, but it's nice to have at least one knife you're willing to hand to your less skilled friends.  It also has a diamond hone, which will actually sharpen knives, not just align their edges (though I use a DMT diamond hone for sharpening.)I find this assortment considerably more useful than many others, which include things like boning knives, carvers and bread knives--all of which are IMO far too specialized to include in a basic knife kit, especially for home cooks.  The only shortcoming of the block set is the inclusion of laughably dubious kitchen scissors.   I hope that Calphalon will see fit to add to the line at least a 10"" chef, and a 9-10"" santoku, but most of the funkily ergonomic (or just funky) knife lines I've looked at don't have those, alas.I have no idea if I'll continue to like this knife as it enters daily use.  I hope that Amazon will let me revise my rating later if it turns out to be overly optimistic, but based on this one afternoon's use (and since they force me to rate it) I'll give it five stars.~ Kiran &lt;entropy@io.com",0

There are three separate etchings on each glass, a flower, bee, and butterfly.  I paid less than $16 for these glasses, with super saving shipping, because they were part of a 4 for 3 special being run by Amazon.  They are very much worth that price.  The only reason that they don't get five stars is that they are a little smaller than I thought they would be.  I intended for them to be used as water glasses, which they can be, but they just could have been a little bigger",0

Every other vacuum I have had sucked up the area rugs and had to be lifted onto them and avoid the edges. This vacuum just rolls right on and cleans them corner to corner! I leave the brush on all the time since we have 2 large hairy dogs. The hair does not build up in the brush because suction is strong enough to pull it thru. Small footprint, stores on charging base, lightweight and easy to assemble and use. It has dual filters so there is absolutely NO EMISSION smell and the outside filter that protects the inside filter is very easy to clean, then all snaps right back in place.

3276,"great product!. I was surprised by what poor reviews most of the crock pots received on amazon.com, but I decided to buy this little one when I saw it at Target for $9.99.  Figured even if it didn't work well, that's not much money to lose!  Well, this is my first crock pot and I love it.  I'm glad there's one this small.  I usually fill it only half way and then have leftovers, but it could probably feed a family of four without leftovers. A lot of reviews for other crock pots said that the lids often fit poorly, but the lid on mine is perfect.  I've used it seven times so far and everything has been wonderful!  I particularly like the applesauce recipe that comes with the crock pot, it makes the best applesauce ever and it's nice to just peel them the night before and wake up to hot applesauce (also good over ice cream).  Keep in mind that the crock pot only has the low heat setting, but I haven't had any trouble cooking recipes that call for the high setting in here.  Just takes a bit longer.  Also, it's not tough at all to convert recipes for larger crocks to fit this one.  Mine doesn't have any problem with cooking to hot, maybe it was just the other reviewer's crock pot.  I would recommend this to anyone, it's well worth the money",0

3279,"Best One Out There. I can't say I've literally tried or tested every counter-top buffet range there is, but this one's construction is clearly superior to all competitor's products.  I hesitated - Broil King?  Who are they? - sounds like some cheap, discount store brand, but I bought due to the all-steel construction because all the others, made largely out of plastic, seemed seriously cheesy to me.  This unit is genuinely solidly built out of all metal, nicely chrome plated with nice quality controls.  It works well to boot - like a good quality stove-top.  You really get a full range heat control.  I use mine at holiday time when my gas range is suffering from no vacancy.  This will gently warm things without burning when set at low - a true test of the quality of the unit.  Cheaper units ""look"" like they have full range controls but in fact, you get off and screech.  Thanksgiving can be ruined if your mashed potatoes ""warming"" on your extra burner burst into flames because the ""low"" setting was mostly wishful thinking on the manufacturer's part.  An excellent unit - a bit of an investment, but definitely worthwhile. I only use it twice a year, but will never regret it",0

We blend the powder with water and a few ice cubes, and it makes the drink thick and frothy like a milkshake, which tastes much better.  Also, there are different shake formulas for men and women, so I can't just make up one batch for both of us.

The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear.

3299,"Henckels vs. Wusthof. I'm sure by now, you're confused by which brand you should choose... is it the Henckels or the Wusthof Santoku?  If that isn't your dilemma, skip on down to the next reviewer.  I just got the Santoku for a steal of a price... and that is why i went for this over the Wusthof which goes for $5 more (Classic hollow-edge).  I was looking at the Wusthof for over a month and was completely impressed w/ the feel and balance.  I think the Henckels still comes in just below the Wusthof.  There are hundreds of other knife manufacturers in Solingen, Germany... it's only that Henckels spent tons of money on global marketing.  Back to the knife... once i got home, I quickly dug for a carrot (tougher to chop) and a cucumber.  I tried to chop the carrot like i was banging on a drum... and it chopped fine.  As far as the traditional, knuckles out cutting technique, it worked fine.  My only advice for you is to definitely try out both knives and look for the most comfortable.  You'll notice that one may have a heavy-heel/light-handle feel to it(vice versa)... it is ALL PREFERENCE.  I actually got kind of tired chopping the carrots b/c theAlso keep in mind... the hollow edges on the knife really don't make a difference.  If anything, it's an aesthetical bonus.  So try out the non-hollow edged ones... it may be a few $$$'s cheaper.  Also keep in mind, the difference between the Pro 'S', &quot;4-Star&quot; and &quot;5-Star&quot; knives are the handles.  I didn't like the &quot;5-Star&quot; knives b/c of the ergonomic handle.  Anyone can tell you that you're not supposed to wrap your hands around the whole handle.  Instead you should be using your thumb and index to grip the finger guard/bolster.  So thus, the Pro 'S' is a good pick, but I'm still going to give the 5-star rating to the Wusthof Classic 7&quot; Santoku",0

First package 'disappeared' at UPS.  When they shipped the first machine, it was evidently damaged and returned back to Amazon by UPS. (probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing)  The replacement shipment arrived just fine, and, as always Amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'",0
3301,"Fully taste the great wine you paid for. If you're going to spend money on good wine, don't put it in cheap glassware - you'll be throwing your money away! What a reviewer below referred to as the ""odd/ugly angular bend"" is exactly what enables these glasses to bring out the full flavor of the wine. Do you just want your table to look ""pretty"" or do you want the food and drink to taste fabulous? If you want the latter, shove aside some of those Martha Stewart table decorations to make room for these glasses and enhance your fine wines",0
3302,"Excellent choice!. I would recommend this knife set to anyone...the quality is great, the look is great, and these things are very sharp.  Nothing bad to say about them",0
3303,"Great for a gift and pets. I saw these in stores last year and added to my cart last week with the free giveaway.  I have to say this has turned out to be a great toy for my dog!  Probably not what it was intended for, but she loves it!  Thanks for the free gift",0
3304,Great Invention. It does leave the egg a little soggy but all you have to do is drain the water off before putting on your sandwich. The only other problem I jhave with it is that the egg sticks the the pan its in. Even pam dosen't help much. The sadwiches are delicious and it only takes about 10 min. or less. I highly recommend the product,0
3305,"Love this unit. This lives up to it's great reviews.  It is beautiful and works fantastically and matches very nicely with my decor.  Highly recommended.  (It will scratch easily though, so be careful.",0
3306,Nice mop pads. I purchased these to use with my Steamfast mop. They are machine washable and fit fine even after being thrown in the dryer. Perhaps the Steamfast head is slightly smaller than the Bissell...I don't know about that but they fit well on it. They are sturdy and well made.,0
3307,"Anti-bark dog collar. This is a great product. We have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people, kids, bikes, dogs and pretty much anything. We use the collar on him maybe 2 times and now he hardly ever barks in the car. We still use the collar once in awhile. We are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach. So far we like it a lot",0
3308,SO PLEASED. I came looking for another set.  They are heavy but elegant.  The best part is the design of the bottom.  Water drains cleanly from the glasses and they come out sparkling,0
3309,great filters. The filters are replacement parts for those that came with the deep fryer when newly purchased.  They work as advertised,0

3311,"Awesome Coffee Maker. This thing is great... I've had it for about a year and no problems. Refurbished products are worth it (I got this one for half price). Very easy to use -- just put in a filter and drop in a tablespoon for each cup you plan to make, fill up the pot itself with the number of cups (see lines), and pour into the back and press on.Good ish.",0
3312,"Furi Rachel Ray Knife Set. These knives are well balanced and very sharp. Slicing through celery, onion, peppers is a breeze. I have arthirtis and many knives are difficult to use.",0
3313,"Small but powerful. We have been using this heater for over a month now, it is a powerful little heater. I wanted to get a ceramic heater because I read they are  the safest space heaters you can buy. This is important because you here a lot of horror stories of space heaters causing fires. The heater has three settings low, high and auto(ranging from 900-1500 watts of electrical power). On the low setting the heater puts out 900 watts. We usually use it on auto where you set the handy digital thermostat to a set temp. and the unit maintains that temperature, you can either set it on the unit or by using the handy included remote control. I was surprised to see how well this unit heats about a 220 square foot space. I would recommend this unit with confidence, my only issue with the unit is do not expect it to save you money over other space heaters i.e. oil filled electric radiators. My electric bill seems to have gone up using this heater over a previous oil filled electric unit by the same manufacturer. I will say, that this unit does heat the room much better then the previous unit, largely due to the fan dispersing the heat",0
3314,"Fantastic!. Having grown up with an old-school pressure cooker (tic-tic-tic), I was a little reluctant to make the switch to this new-fangled gadget. However, I was hooked after the first few quick and easy meals that I wouldn't have tried in the old one. In a word: BEANS. The foaming problem that can make such a mess in the old models is almost perfectly solved by the new pressure release system. Once it comes up to pressure, you can reduce the heat and keep everything going without spurting steam all over the place. The little yellow button stays up - you know when the cooker is pressurized and can adjust the heat to keep things moving along. Works like a charm",0
3315,"Great bowls. These bowls have been in my home for a few years now.  We have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave.  They are nice looking and very functional.  When we needed another bowl when one broke, we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl",0
3316,A+ Seller. Item arrived just as described.  No problems at all.  Very nice transaction,0
3317,"I've used better but this is good. For the price, this is good for spot cleaning crumbs and small areas.  Obviously, it cannot replace a vacuum.  It does come apart a little too easy, but this happens when my sons use it",0
3318,Excellent Product!. I am sure GLAD that I purchased one of these....it really comes in handy for alot of various cooking chores.... I especially enjoy Roasting Chickens with it,0
3319,"Works fine 7 fins total not 9 but I am satisfied with it. OK, first of all I am very satisfied with the TRR0715. It is silent and heats the room well even on the 750 watt setting.Unlike the picture , the unit I received has 5 middle fins and 2 end fins for a total of 7. I don't know if they changed the model or used the wrong picture but I am satisfied with what I got and mention it because it seems to be a big issue",0
3320,"Perhaps the Best Decision I have made. I researched and researched semi-automatic and automatic machines until I was so thoroughly confused that I had no idea which way to go. Alicia at Whole Latte Love steered me towards the S7 after answering many of my questions and thankfully she was very knowledgeable and listened to my needs.  The S7 is a great machine, makes near perfect espresso (I don't call anything perfect), and has no learning curve whatsoever.If you can follow directions and learn what 8 buttons mean then you can make perfect lattes, espressos, americanos, and cremas too.  Clean up is a breeze which was another one of my big concerns.  The speed of the machine is unbelievable as well.  With two boilers there is no waiting at all and 96 oz of on board water means you can make a lot of drinks between re-fillsI just can't say enough positive things about this machine but from the control you have over the mixture of water and ""powder"" (coffee) to the water temperature to the ease with which it works to the amount of time you get to spend enjoying your drinks vs. working on the machine; this machine is the best. I have tried cheaper machines to no avail if you are considering this whether it is your first or your last consider the S7 very seriously",0
3321,"Pretty Good for the Price. I'm pretty happy with this product, though I've only had it for 2 weeks so I cannot comment on the longevity. It was the lowest priced rug to rug pad I found. There is some very small movement on my high traffic rugs, but it is very small, just enough to let some of the pad peek out, there was no bunching at all. The regular traffic rugs haven't moved a bit.",0

3323,"A GODSEND FOR A HOUSEHOLD ENGINEER... Okay, so I researched products and prices for the last six weeks, searching for what I eventually discovered was THIS little beauty!  I have COPD, and am not strong, and I have a kennel of ten dogs and live rurally with all that dust.  It is imperative that my house be dirt and dust free.  I needed this to go over the kitchen floor twice a day, to pick up any hair, dust, dog toenails, whatever...IT IS MAGNIFICENT!  Hey, it's not my Oreck, but I found that I couldn't use the Oreck on the vinyl flooring, because it was causing static electricity, and the short hair would stick to the floor and not come up.  THE PRODUCT GOT IT UP, it is VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, and did a marvelous job.  WHAT A GREAT BUY!  Amazon carried it cheapest, via Allergy Be Gone  :)One drawback:  16' cord.  A 20' cord would be so much better, but I will manage  :",0
3324,O.K. Product shipped in timely fashion. I knew what the product would be and am happy with it,0
3325,"Amazing cookware. I received a few all clad products (the paella pan, sauce pan, and a fry pan) for graduation and they are excellent.  Despite not being teflon, food doesn't seem to stick and clean up is easy.  The handles don't get hot even though they're metal too (they do get a little warmish, so be careful just in case).  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to or not, but I put them in the dishwasher and haven't had any problems.  This specific pan is great for items like pasta w/ cheese and veggies.  I love that it has a cover.  The only drawback is the price",0
3326,"Works great. Yes, like the other reviewers say, it works just as you'd want it to work. I do have a few nits to pick (and hence the four stars) that I don't recall anyone else mentioning:- The cord is really short. I suppose it's designed that way so it can be stored in the base, but it only extends 29"" from the base. May or may not be a problem for you depending on where your outlets are.- The temperature adjustment knob feels really cheap. A friend of mine said it feels like it isn't attached to anything. I agree, but in fact it is. I just hope it's more durable than it feels.- Unlike the Waring Pro WMK300, this has no spill tray. The plastic base is just bowl-shaped to contain spills and crumbs. I didn't really have any spills, but a removable tray would be nicer (if not as attractive).- Made in China. Not that I'm opposed to China getting my money, but until China does more to protect its workers and environment I prefer my money go to countries that do better on those fronts. Just my $0.02.The description is incorrect. The waffles are 6.5"" across the top and 7"" across the middle.My favorite topping so far is sliced frozen strawberries (thawed, of course) and fresh real whipped cream.elena lisa:I followed the instructions to apply oil with a pastry brush and never had a stuck waffle. Personally, I hate aerosol cooking sprays. They work, but:- It's impossible to confine the fine mist they produce to the cooking surface and I rarely want to oil my stove or counter top.- According to Calphalon they use a propellant that can make cookware harder to clean.I can't confirm the latter but I know that they get an oil film on things I don't want oiled",0
3327,Great Pillows  for Kids. Loved this pillow.  it is a lot of  fun,0

3329,THE BEST!. i've used it for a year now and i cannot buy a cappuccino at starbucks or any other mediocre place now. The espresso in my home is the best you can get outside of Italy. We are even buying a second one for our summer house!!!,0
3330,"Good product. My husband loved European coffee and this has allowed him to brew very fresh European style coffee.  The larger press is used when he is at home, and the smaller when he is on the go. They have been proven WELL worth the cost!  (Which is a GREAT deal!!",0
3331,"Excellent cookware. Prior to receiving this saucier pan for Christmas, I had only associated KitchenAid with appliances. I am highly impressed with the quality of this cookware. The saucier is solid and heavy--food heats evenly and the pan  doesn't warp on your stove when using high heats. I use this pan as often  as possible and am now considering replacing my current set of pots and  pans with the entire KitchenAid set. Highly recommended",0
3332,"Doesn't fit perfectly in 18150, but works. The filter model I have, 18150, requires two of these with no foam spacers.  Two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter I purchased once previously.  However, I'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall, maybe slightly less.  The cover still goes on, but not as far down as it should.As for filtering, I estimate that it filters the same as the previous.  The ""permanence"" of this filter makes me wonder why I've been replacing the previous style, since I can see no difference in the filter material",0
3333,"excellent knife for home cooks with small/medium hands. I received this knife recently as a wedding gift and I have been very pleased with its performance.Note, however, that while the edge as shipped is sharp enough to slice through onions and scallions completely, it isn't sharp enough to slice through office paper dropped from mid-air--the kind of edge that many knife enthusiasts look for--so sharpening is recommended.The Gourmet line is the lowest end of the Wusthof line that is manufactured in Germany (the Silverpoint line is made elsewhere). While Wusthof literature says that this knife is made from the same steel as their higher-end knives, the Gourmet line is made from stamped steel as opposed to forged steel.As for the knife itself, the blade tapers from the handle to the tip. The knife has good heft and its rivets are flush against the handle. There is no bolster or finger guard--a plus factor, in my opinion, because it makes proper sharpening of the edge easier. It also allows me to use the entire edge when I am slicing larger pieces of meat.On the other hand, I docked a star because the tang (the part of the blade that goes through the handle) does not go all the way--it is only a 3/4 tang (top and half of the rear of the handle only). I do not think that this factor affects the performance of the knife very significantly, but one gets a full tang from the comparable knife in the Gourmet line of Henckels for a slightly lower price.Nevertheless, it is a great value for a higher-end knife. I highly recommend it",0
3334,"light duty, but gets the job done. I bought this stockpot because I'd started making my own soup at home. I was hoping to get a pot that was a little more heavy duty, because this one is a bit thin. However, I used it anyway, and in true Farberware form, this pot came through for me. So, aside from being lightweight, this one does its job. Plus, a great price, too",0

3340,"It's hard being green. Although the dishes are not as green as I anticipated, they are lovely.  I ordered a ""natural"" set (for a mix & match look) from a catalogue store and they were not any nicer, although they were considerably more expensive, so now I am ordering a ""natural"" set of these.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the antiquing is not as subtle as I would like but it's good enough for the price.  I love them!",0
3341,"Very Good. I was very pleased with how quickly I received the stroller. It was package well. It took a couple of minutes to assemble and it was ready to go. Plus it was affordable, very sturdy, easy to manuver, and get down stair. It is such a blessing to have one of these. My Westie is a bit overwieght (28lbs) and he loves it. He has room to stretch out, sit up. I can see him at all times because of the mesh veiwer.  I can take him on the train, in stores, where ever I want, because he's secured and enclosed. I get alot of compliments and some strange looks because it looks just like a baby stroller, even better than some of them I was told. ****The only thing I would say bad about it is that the mesh cover has a toxic smell to it....BUT once I took it outside a couple of times it did air out, and the smell is gone. ****Also to make it more comfortable I did place a cusion lining inside.

The oversized feed tube makes pre-processor preparation much simpler as I don't have to try to ""fit"" my ingredients into a narrow tube.  Clean-up is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the fully-sealed motor/base which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any misses/messes.  It's quiet and efficient.  I only wish that there were more outlets (hear me Amazon?) that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level.  Overall, I am highly satisfied and happy I spent a little more and got the best",0

We've used them daily for nearly a month now, with twice-weekly washings in hot/warm and a full cycle in the dryer at high temps. They've remained fluffy, in excellent condition, and simply wonderful. Stepping out of the bath and wrapping up in one of the bathtowels makes me feel like I'm in a spa, and the oversized washcloths and hand towels feel pricey. I'm ordering another set for our upstairs bathroom",0
3346,"Wonderful gadget for the coffee buff. Warning! Roasting coffee produces smoke!  Definitely read up on the process thoroughly before buying.  The first batch I made with this machine I over roasted due to my ignorance.  It was darker than a French roast and had little body or flavor and smoked the house up.  After reading some more I adjusted the program and kept a closer eye on it and roasted an amazing Sumatran coffee with FAR less smoke.  I am drinking a cup of said batch right now and it is wonderfully clean and delightful.  One newbie to newbie note; coffee roasting is not a ""set it and forget it"" kind of process.  This is more or less like cooking.  It requires your attention or every smoke alarm in the house will be going off; no, seriously!  It does have a safety feature so that it will not run longer than 15 min and will shut off if it overheats, so fire risk is minuscule even for the most scatter brained of us.  Check out this website for details on the roasting process to get a feel if it is right for you.  [...] Sweet Maria's also has an amazing assortment of green beans of very high quality from what I can tell.  The machine does come with a vent pipe adapter if any smoke in the house bothers you.  If you have a hood that vents to the outside then smoke is a non issue.  A full city roast produces about the same amount of smoke as a cigarette, obliviously without the nasty cig smell.  It's kind of funny because the green beans don't smell particularly good nor does the roasting process.  Not bad but not good.  Yet the finished product is so, so good!  Now that you know it produces smoke ... this machine works great and produces a very even roast.  It has a commercial grade motor which is about as loud as a vacuum cleaner, certainly not enough to wake the neighbors.  The programming functionality is great and I look forward to tweaking it for that perfect roast.  The user interface could definitely be improved and is a bit cumbersome, but I did not find it to be very difficult to program at all.  Also the LCD screen is kind of cheap and angled poorly so you basically got to flip it on its side under good light to program it.  However this is one of only a few programmable machines on the market, the only one for this price.  It roasts around 6oz which is quite a bit unless you drink two pots a day.  ...  pauses to take a sip of smashingly good coffee ...  If you are a coffee buff who leans toward the creative side you will probably like this machine.  I give it 4 stars because wholesale electronic parts are cheap and they could have put better LCD screen on it and angled it so you can read it standing up.  Other than that this thing rocks",0
3347,"Great Quality, Great Size!. My wife and I have long been fans of Fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years.

(smile)The quality of these plates is very good and this size is very uselul. For some reason these are seldom seen as part of a standard set. We use ours all the time...Highly Recommended!",0
3348,"Uniquely Useful Little Crockpot -- consider its possibilities!. This is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes. I've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades (currently a 6 quart Rival Smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals), but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space & aren't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities. This little crockpot, however, is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew. I originally bought it, however, because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings, especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop, such as steel-cut oatmeal (try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once (also available here at Amazon) & you're unlikely ever to return to instant or ""quick cook"" oatmeal again). There is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen & knowing that a healthy, delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you. From mid-October to late-March, virtually every night I prepare my entire family's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot, with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave.Other uses we've discovered: it's perfect for making & serving hot mulled cider; keeping hot dips, gravies & warm sauces & syrups heated on the buffet; as a substitute fondue pot; & for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient (how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup!). For single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space, this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker, especially if used in conjunction with Rival's inexpensive SP100-PDQ Smart-Part Module (also sold on Amazon as of the date of this review), which provides the same timed-cooking controls that are integrated with many of Rival's larger, more expensive crockpots.The energy used is minimal, too -- only 80 watts -- & the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher, as does the lid, for very convenient clean-up",0
3349,"The BEST Cervical roll-- for me, at least. As a physical therapist who suffers from neck pain, this is the ONLY pillow that I can use without waking up to having cervical muscle spasms in the mornings.

It has been a week that I have been waking up to neck spasms & I am delighted to find that it is here at Amazon.

3354,"Good but expensive. Apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new S5 series of Miele vacuum cleaners, the features, price, and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models, nor even across series.  Many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones.  They have fancy names like Capricorn, Red Velvet, and Champagne, leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car.  If your browser has tabbed browsing (e.g., Firefox), the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to Miele's website and open a tab for each model you're interested in.  Flip back and forth to see what text changes.  Callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series (newest technology motor?) that still comes with an electronically powered brush (the 4th Pisces model is turbo).After 3 months of extensive use:Pros:Agility - The 10 "" wide SEB217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard, and one of the reasons I chose this model.  For me, smaller is better.  While other vacuums advertise large 13"" power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe, I don't have much open carpet space.  Coffee tables, chairs, weight benches, and computers, all need vacuuming around and under.  The powerbrush swivels well to get around corners.Brush duster - The most commonly used attachment (for me), the brush duster is also small (slightly larger in diameter than the hose) and the bristles are durable.  It's angled by default, but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out.  This is not mentioned anywhere; you just have to figure this out for yourself.  On low power, I was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before, like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires.  I even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk.Parquet floor brush - Initially, I wondered why Miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included, but this ""wider brush duster"" actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush.  The powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets, but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better.  On the negative side, you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust, and I wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for ""genuine horse bristles"".  There is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush, so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don't get separated for life (the powerbrush takes precedence).Cord rewind - The mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time, something like 15 for 15 times!  (The manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat.)Cons:Price - After all, it's just a vacuum cleaner.  There also seems to be price fixing in the newer S5 series, at least when I bought this.  Everywhere I checked (maybe 10 websites), the price was exactly $799 or $799.95, with the only difference being no tax and/or free shipping.  One website even advertised ""The lowest price allowed!""  What's a Diamond Dealer?  Is this Amway?Release buttons - The release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive, being on the part that ""comes off"" rather than on the part that ""stays behind"".  Therefore, you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with.  The hose extension button is particularly confusing.  It's an oval shaped rocker button that ""rocks"" very little.  To extend the stainless steel hose, you have to remember which side of the button (top or bottom) to press.  There is no distinction on which side to press, and it's always a matter of trial and error as I yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button.Stiff no swivel hose - The hose rotates at the top (handle area), but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine.  Instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists, I'd rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists.  The flex hose diameter is larger than I'm used to, making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where I used to store my old vacuum cleaner.  Considering the price, an electrical slip ring would have been nice.Bag full indicator - The mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck.  Put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full.  Right out of the box on short carpet, it indicated bag full on high power.  As I turned the power down, it indicated less full sequentially.  You have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator.  Even at that, there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator.Extra stuff? - The parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose (button doesn't easily click into place).  The extension isn't needed to connect the parquet brush, so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it.  To this day, I still haven't figured out what the extension is for, other than to connect other attachments that I might buy in the future.  This is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that I must ensure does not get separated for life (along with the parquet brush, ""normal"" filter cage, and replacement bags).Symbol marking - The power symbol markings are not obvious at all, contrary to claims.  Other than the symbols labels ""Min"" and ""Max"", you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean.  At least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise.  The Quite Mode is #4 of 6 settings (with 6 being the highest), and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the ""normal"" operating mode.  I think most people will consider ""Max"" the default mode.Optional filter frame - This model comes with a HEPA filter, so you don't need the filter frame unless you're going to switch to the ""normal"" filters, but brand-new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle, apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping.  You don't even need the handle for the frame to function properly, but for the kind of money I paid, nothing should be broken out of the box.  The vendor that I bought it from (Best Vacuum) replaced it for free.So is it worth $800?  It does a good job, but only time will tell..",0
3355,"Great juicer. After plenty of research on the internet, I decided to go with the Omega 8005. I've used it almost every single day, especially throughout mt pregnancy, to make sure I consumed green leafy vegetables everyday. This is a great juicer and I like it better than my vitamix for making hummus. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like it's grinding ability with small quantities and I think it could leave drier pulp.",0
3356,"dirt devil vision self propelled. The dirt devil vision self propelled is the best vacuum in the world for carpets not bare floors it does a loisy job on bare floors. it is better then any dyson or any hoover or the expensive kirbyvacc. You ask why. Why indeed. First of all You probably gotsucked or suckered into believing that suction is the most important thing in a vacuum Right . No im afraid not. Its all in the beater bar brush, the faster it goes the better it will clean your carpets all the so called suction does is remove what the beater bar brush pulls out. yes the better the suction the faster it gets rid of what the brush pulls up. Mr dyson seems to think that suction is all that matters its not. dyson vacuums are poor on rugs  becausethefloatingheadon them doesnt get down far enough to get the really deep down dirt like the dirtdevil vision self propelled .Also, an important thing is having a solid line of brush on the beater bar.the others like dyson or hoover well theyvegot gaps in there brushes why, who knows maybe they think there is better air movement or something.cosumer rates that the hoover windtunnel self propelled is the best vacuuminthere tests.well i have that model too and yes it does do a good job but it doesntdeep clean like the dirt devil. the drive belts also burn outreally quick so its hard to push and pull. the cons of the dirt devil vision are this.yes its noisy yes its bad on bare floors yes you have to clean the filter ihappento clean mine with another vaccum or i use my air compressor to blow it off. i have a very big house and have tested vacuums for years i have a dyson dc14 animal a hoover windtunnel and a kirby.by the way the selfpropelled motor doesntuse a belt like hoovers windtunnel. i tell you folks for carpets its the best.Ivehad it for 3years the hoover for 3years and the dyson for 3months and the kirby for a 1year You will find that nothing pulls out more then that machine. nothing. for the money u can buy a dirtdevil vision at your local walmart for 98.00 pretty cheep the design is one of the best easy to empty dirt container the self propelled feature is much better then the hoovers windtunnel. Why these other reviewers say the belts burn out fast is beyond me i vacuum every day or everyother day because i have pets and my wife has got allergies. just to let you know the dyson is a good machine but dosnt have the power a dirt devil has you turn that dirt devil on and you can feel the floor just vibrate and you can hear that beater bar just going like crazy on the floor. If you buy one youll be in a shock as to what youll pull out of your carpets. and people, this vac like most other bagless vacs have filters of some sort. They do have to be cleaned now and then, the dirt devils suction is very good and it doesnt lose suction very fast . the only way it ever would is if you never clean the damn thing. thats the price people that you pay for bagless vacs. Clean the filter once a week or every two weeks depending on how much you use it again i use mine almost everyday and i clean the filter once a week. if you never clean the filter you know it probably would do a poor job. after seeing the other reviews im very interested in finding out how theres seem to be falling apart or not running very well. ive owned mine for 3years and never had any problems, yes ive changed the belt on it and have bought a new filter for it now and then but, im wondering why these other people are having such difficulty. folks the vac is like anything , if you take care of it, it will last. i mean the things got one belt and one filter how hard is that. i suppose if you beat the hell out of it, i suppose it could brake. dum da dum dum dumm",0
3357,"Best price from AMAZON. BEAUTIFUL set!!  I can't believe I researched pots and pans but I did and learned many things.  For these particular pans, reviewers brought up some good points:For the Teflon debate about cancer causing coating -- these are hard anodized aluminum, as mentioned.  The Anolon.com website has an ""Earth Friendly"" icon that states they use no harmful materials.  I will be washing mine by hand, to reduce wear and tear.For durability -- they offer a Lifetime Warranty.For Amazon's part -- in my experience with them, shipping is always a breeze.  Items typically arrive earlier than promised.  The manufacturer packed the pots and pans, so it arrived in its original box, inside an Amazon.com box, with a little extra packing for travel.  The glass lids were packed well, so nothing was broken.I bought these from Amazon.com because:First -- I want to start cooking more regularly and needed a GOOD set for everyday cooking, that will last for years.  A good place to look for the non-experienced cook was on Macys.com, where they gave a comparison of the different brands they offered.  It helped in deciding what type of coating (if any) would work best for me.Second -- The price and ease of purchase.  Original price for this set was $425.00.  Sales price when I went to Macy's was $299.95.  On Amazon (a couple of weeks ago) was $199.95, so already far better than Macy's.  Amazon also had the 8 piece set for the same price, which made the 10 piece set an even bigger deal.  Free shipping AND a coupon for more money off.  The grand total from Amazon was $174.95!!  For a $425.00 set, that is not bad at all!!I look forward to using these and by all accounts, expect them to hold up to their claims of durability. The fact that they are oven safe, gives me confidence in those claims.  I rate this set 4 stars for overall appearance, weight, and anticipation of good cooking and easy clean up.  If not, I promise this review will be amended.My advice -- wait for a holiday sale, when you can get the best price.  The price on this set has already gone up.  Hope this helps",0
3358,"Drinkwell Pet Fountain with Reservoir Plus. This is the perfect water dispenser for cats! I already have one up on my sink, where one feeding/watering area is, and I'm buying another set for the floor. I have 5 cats, 3 of them neutered males, and I've noticed that my cats drink more from running water.  Two of my cats are Bengal kittens and Bengals love water! I feel much more comfortable providing my cats with water in this manner, very similar to drinking from a running tap, because my cats drink more and I think that this cuts down on cystitis, especially in the neutered males. If one has multiple cats, then even the small reservoir is too small, in my opinion, and it has to be filled too often. The charcoal filter even filters out chlorine and other things in tap water that are bad for cats",0

3363,"Nice weight- pouring spouts wonderful!. I have been using many months and am very pleased I purchased.  The bottoms are heavy enough to use on the smooth glass cook-tops without scorching.  The steam/ pouring spouts are great! No more boil overs or losing whatever you are trying to drain down the sink.  The lid on the largest pot is NOT a good fit for any of the skillets.  I purchased both the 10 and 12"" lids and additional 2qt pan.  I have not used metal utensils except for serving from the pans.  They did pass my usual test of all nonstick surfaces- a medium pressure scrapping of a metal cooking utensil across the surface.  CAUTION- If you have a black glass cook-top, the bottoms will cause aluminum marks, but not after washed the first time. I made the mistake unpacking mine on top of my Jenn Aire black cook-top. I wouldn't change a thing, except that I do wish the open stock lids were available with the glass inserts also, as the open stock lids are not as heavy weight stainless. They are about like the traditional Revere sets. I have used the traditional Revere (all stainless) set for 20 years and was VERY pleased to find this set much heavier and more substansial. The stainless is so shiny that I do find myself being over protective so that it stays that way!",0

3367,"I am real happy with this oven. This little toaster oven gets the job done for me. I think the quality is a little bit better, it is a little deeper making it a little bigger and the tempeture is more consistant than the other units in it's price range. I am still looking for the right setting on the tempeture and once I find it I will most likely leave it there. I think it will end up somewhere between 350 and 400. Below that takes to long and above that setting the food tends to get a little over cooked on the outside.One thing that concerned me was the safety instructions, which I always read. They do not want you to use aluminum foil or any non Proctor Silex cooking trays in this unit. I always use aluminum foil and it does not seem to cause any problem. Perhaps they are just covering for themselves in case something goes wrong because you never know what sort of crazy stuff people are going to put into their ovens. This is the only thing that concerns me. Otherwise the little oven is working out real good. I think it will last us quite a while. Usually we get rid of them because they get to dirty or get a little old looking more then it is a problem that they wear out or break. The last one cost us about $10 and lasted almost a year. This one cost a little more but I am sure it will last longer.We have had expensive confection ovens that cost well over $100 but I decided to save my money because this one gets the job done and does what we need it to do. Esp with the extra 2 inches of depth this is a nice sized little unit.",0
3368,"Best Washer I used! Compact. Quiet. Clean... I have been using this Haier for HLP21E 2 weeks. I live in an apartment and there is not enough room there. This machine is great!  It takes so little room. I just put it in the bathroom. It is so convenient.Before I am cooking a meal, I throw 4 or 5 clothes into it, and after I finish my lunch the clothes ready. The spin is so good that the clothes are almost dry. for some clothes like T shirts you don't even need a dryer. We have public laundry using coins, but I think this Haier small washer washes much cleaner than that. And what's more important you don't have to drive far out to the laundry.It is very quiet, at least much much more quiet than the public laundry. You can do other things like listening to music in your bedroom and the washer works in your bathroom. It doesn't interfere.And I move sometimes, so it's much better you have a smaller washer than a huge one. I just cant love this small machine more",0
3369,Love this!!. Great cover to change the look of my room.  Great deal for the price,0
3370,"Great suction, but a bit disappointed in attachments. I have 3 indoor cats and a cat allergy.  I was excited by the Dyson in the hopes that it would help keep my allergies at bay.  After a ton of research, I chose the DC14 Complete specifically because it had the attachments I wanted (and was cheaper than the Animal despite being the same exact thing).  I wanted a low reach tool to be able to get the cat hair and God knows what else from under my bed and the mini turbine tool to clean my furniture.After receiving my Dyson (which, by the way, has a 6 mo. warranty rather than the 90-day in the listing), I did the whole ""vacuum with old then vacuum with new"" test.  I had a 12 amp Bissell CleanView which worked well.  But the Dyson did manage to pull out more hair and dirt from the carpet.  Not tons, but enough to convince me that my Bissell was leaving dirt behind.Next came the attachment test.  The low reach was great!  I loved that I could get under my bed easily.  HOWEVER, I am seriously disappointed in the mini-turbine head.  The brushes stop rotating when you put the attachment onto the fabric!  Well, what good does that do?  I thought I was using it wrong until I read some other reviews.  Thank God Eureka makes the Power Paw!  It does what the Turbine Tool promises but doesn't deliver.  At least the Power Paw brushes continue to spin while cleaning the fabric.  And for $20, the price was right. (Plus it fits on my Dyson)Overall I'm happy with my purchase but definitely want people to be aware that the Mini Turbine Tool is worthless as an attachment",0

Once plugged in, the timer turns the lights on automatically at dusk (which has been between 4:30 and 5 p.m. here in upstate New York) and keeps them on as long as you specify--4, 6, or 8 hours or even until dawn.  Since we began using the timer, its performance has been perfect, and no more going out in the cold for me!  Highly recommended",0

We ordered the Bark Stop Pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking.  We were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we're very thankful that this device works.  You have to use the high frequency for the big dogs.

3376,"My ideal fry pan. I recently upgraded my range from a gas model to an electric smooth surface cooktop (which I LOVE).  I soon realized that a lot of my old (cheaper) cookware which had worked just fine on my old stove didn't work as well on my new one.  Because of the nature of the design of this type of cooktop, the heat ""transfers"" to the cookware instead of the ""direct"" heat of conventional cooking.  Bottom line is that your cookware needs to sit flat in order to perform well.  Mine didn't.  I bought this set because I wanted 4 things: 1)heavy-duty cookware to work with my new cooktop, 2)a non-stick finish in the fry pan only (but stainless steel in the pots); 3)a strainer built into the lids and 4)see-through clear lids.

In fact, this sharpener is part of the reason I bought my Global in the first place.I can only guess that using a light, even stroke and making sure that the knife is straight up and down in the sharpening slots is important to the sharpening technique.Also, the sharpener doesn't work on many non-global knives because of the weird bevel Global edges have so don't think it's going to work on your Wustof unless you have a professional re-cut the bevel to a Global-style.Buy one, follow the directions and you and your Globals will be very happy.",0

3399,"Great!. I was looking for a crockpot that wasn't too large and wasn't too expensive. This product fit the bill.The lid is treated glass so, you can see the food cooking without lifting the lid. The lid handle stays cool during the cooking, so you won't burn your fingers if you touch it. The ceramic cooker is sturdy and alittle heavy. It can become slippery when wet, so be careful while washing it in the sink. Also be careful because the handles on the cooker and the metal base can become very hot during cooking. So keep potholders nearby.The cooker can accomodate a 3.5-4 pound whole chicken and 4 pound roasts. It's oval shape enables these foods to fit well. It comes with a small instruction manual that includes some recipes.So far, I've cooked whole grain cereal (barley and cracked wheat), stews, whole chickens, corned-beef, and turkey legs. They've turned out good. However, since I'm new to slow-cooking, the first attempts were abit off because I cooked the food too long. But now, I'm better with the timing so the food is better.Just a side note, if you like eating whole grain cereals, the slow cooker is terrific. You don't need to stand over a stove stirring the pot and worrying it will boil over. This cooking method allows the grains to fully absorb the water, which makes for a creamier end result. Plus, you can toss the grains and water into the cooker at bedtime and it's done in time for your breakfast.I do have a two very minor complaints:1. The packaging. The cooker is packaged in a way that you have to slide it out of the box. If you aren't careful, you could drop the ceramic cooker or the glass lid.2. The handle to the lid was alittle loose, and could be made tighter with 1 turn. But that might not be a design flaw, but a way to compensate for the expansion of the glass during the cooking process. So, don't mess with it, imo.Otherwise this is a great product",0
3400,"Best Cup of Coffee Ever!. We got this just after Christmas, and it is absolutely the best cup of coffee that we have had since we were in Italy.  I can't stand to drink drip coffee anymore.  There are several things to keep in mind for the best results.  (1) Use good filtered or spring water (2) Use a finely ground good coffee, such as Illy (3) pack it just slightly in the filter (4) Don't try to rush it by turning the heat up too high (5) NEVER put it in the dish washer.We have been using the organic espresso blend from Whole Foods, and it is almost as good as the Illy.  All in all, this is easier and faster than most coffee makers and gives us a nice two servings of espresso in the morning.  Add a little milk if you like, but it's also great straight out of the pot",0

My daughter can't have food dye and I was able to find syrup that was all-natural and organic, and it actually tastes good",0
3406,"My cats love it!!. My three cats; Max, Smokey and Charlie just love my new pet waterer.  I was a little hesitant to buy it because Max just loves to play in the water and I didn't want a mess. The first day I had it; he sat and kept putting his paw in it but after that he hasn't played in it at all. He loves to drink right from the water slide and he'll just sit and watch the water come down the slide.  Smokey and Charlie have adjusted to it as well and I think all three of them are drinking more water. I've had it for 2wks now and today I cleaned it for the first time.  It was very easy to take apart, clean and reassemble. It is so nice to not have to worry about my cats having fresh water. I would highly recommend this product to any cat lover",0
3407,"Exactly what I wanted. I am very pleased with my new Nordic Ware popper. I am the only one in my household who likes popcorn, so hate to make the large microwave bags or pay the inflated price for the little ones. I'm also on Weight Watchers so need to limit quantity and fat. I put in a few tablespoons, spray with Parkay spray butter, add a little salt and have a delicious low point snack in 2 minutes at the fraction of the cost of individual micro-pop bags. The bowl gets a little hot, but I read that in other reviews before I ordered it, so I always make sure I have a pot holder. Thanks for a great product.",0

3410,"Great product for home kitchen. This is a great pitter for your home kitchen.  It works 90% of the time for me.  The other 10% of time I have the pit remains within the cherry as it fails to get punched out.  I still give it a high rating since this is a mechanical solution which depends on several factors such as: the size of the cherry (medium size works best), the speed and amount of pressure you punch the pit (operator skill can improve the success rate).  The one negative comment I have is that the pitter get rust very easily, and it comes without instruction on how to clean it.  I found out that if  you let it sit for drying after a handwash, it will get rust. What you want to do is to take the pitter apart, wash and dry them with a towel immediately after use.  You can take the assembly apart by simply uncrew the black pitter handle.  The spring and the metal rod can now be pulled out for cleaning. Enjoy",0

Ordered it and just love it.Perfect even toasting, american style pop-up toaster and can accomodate my favorite bagels.I can't believe that you can purchase a quality DUALIT product at this pricepoint. I highly recommend that you go out and buy this item. I'm going to get several as holiday gifts!!!",0
3412,"Exactly what we expected. This is a great handy organizer for three different sized containers, plus the containers and covers.  The containers are in ""even"" metrics sizes: 250, 500, and 750 ml.  It works out to 1.1, 2.1 and 3.2 cups.  The two larger sizes take the same cover, so there are only two different size covers.The organizer takes up a tad more real estate than it needs to, but we'll live with it. Our current collection of plastic containers is just a jumble so this is SOOOO much better we're not complaining.  The dimensions of the organizer are 16 inches wide, by 10.5 inches deep, by 8.5 inches high. It fits OK in our upper shelf in the kitchen.There is enough room in the cover storage bins to add about 4 more large covers and 2 more small covers, if you want to add a couple more containers to the organizer.  The height of your cabinet is the only limit on the number of containers it will hold.The containers microwave nicely--I had some spaghetti microwaved in one container for breakfast.The containers are on the clear side of translucent, so it is relatively easy to see what is inside.  Clearer than most other containers of that kind, though we'll see if they stay clear after a few weeks of microwaving spaghetti sauce!",0

3416,"Very basic starter kit. We gave this small tank 5 stars because of its construction, ease of handling and cleaning. However, since it holds only 2 gallons, it is not suitable for large fish or lots of fish. Keep the number and/or size of fish to a definite minimum.It comes with a small pump and air stone and utilizes an undergravel filtration system. It has a light, but does not come with a heater. It's certainly better than just a plain bowl for keeping your fish.This would be good for a beginner or child as it has a small footprint and is acrylic, not glass, and is not too heavy to handle for easy cleaning. We use it as a temporary holding tank for new fish before introducing them to our larger aquarium. And if one of our fish should get sick or need to be quarantined, this would make a suitable temporary home for him for easy observation, and is easy to clean out to avoid contaminating any other fish that may call it a temporary home in the future.Marineland. com has some good articles on keeping fish in small tanks. This tank will suit your needs if you keep its limitations in mind",0
3417,"Chemically sensitive? Beware the packaging for this fan!. I really like this fan: nice design (yes, it is sleazy plastic, but the only time I noticed it was during assembly); quiet and powerful operation; and the ""nature"" mode is a marvelous innovation.  ""Nature"" mode slows the fan when it faces front so that you are spared a direct blast of air. And a remote control is a luxury when you are too hot to move.IMHO the sole design fault is the LCD display which is too small to read farther than two feet away.However,when I opened the shipping box, a strong chemical smell overwhelmed me, causing a headache - and I am not chemically sensitive!  The smell disappeared after a few minutes, as did the headache.",0
3418,great breadmaker. I bought this breadmaker because I wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf.  It makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use.

3420,"Excellent Fryer. I bought this Fryer to make French Fries at a small food concession I have. Wow! It did a beautiful job on the fries and with the two baskets there's no hold up on customer orders. The fries are done in about 5 minutes and the customers love them. I wish there was a more effective way to clean the elements, but with the ease of using the fryer, I'll make do with carefully wiping it down with a sudsy cloth",0
3421,"A Keeper. I have used many different brands of coffemakers, but this one will be my last. It easily makes the best coffee. This may be because of the use of a paper filter and more than one drip hole which slows the coffee from leaving the grounds too quickly, or it may be because the coffee filter is placed into the decanter. My other coffee makers used a plastic filter, or permanent weave type and the coffee poured through. In order to get hot coffee though you must follow the directions and heat your cup with hot water. It also helps if the water you add is not from the refrigerator. The hottest coffee I've had came from a percolator. I like the fact that the water tank can be removed to fill or left in, and the cup amounts are clearly visible when adding water. I do wish the top had been hinged to the unit though. I also think it is too expensive.",0
3422,"Great espresso from a mid-range machine. After conducting research for a few weeks, visiting Amazon, as well as other coffee aficionado sites, I finally purchased the Saeco Aroma espresso maker and have been using it for going on two weeks. Although this machine may not be as glitzy in appearance compared to some machines, it does make a great espresso. Say for instance, if the Francis Francis is the sexy Ferrari of espresso machines, then the Aroma would be a Volvo--boxy (perhaps considered bland in appearance to some) but solid, reliable, and a well-built machine for the price. Once I got the hang of using the pressurized portafilter, which has to be put on tightly to obtain the correct seal/pressure, I was treated to rich, flavorful espresso with lots of crema.I am pleased with the ease of using the machine, however, the instructions are not very detailed and I found technical support to be slow. Initially I placed a phone call to -- where I did not reach a live person--but left a message. Never received a call back, but called again the next day at which time I did get a live person. To be honest, she seemed ambivalent and downright unhelpful, blaming my problem on the coffee I was using (despite my best efforts to explain the problem). The issue was that after priming the machine and installing the portafilter, the pump would run and run, but no espresso would come out. I ended up tightening the three little screws on the bottom of the portafilter, which seemed to help make it fit more snugly and achieve a pressurized seal. Voila! Perfect espresso. If I had one complaint about this machine, it would be that the portafilter is not very substantial, and is made mostly of plastic.The Aroma's steam wand works REALLY well for frothing milk. Almost too well, as I ended up with a lot of foam, but the second time using it, I backed off on the pressure a bit, and got just the right balance of milk and foam. Overall I am pleased with the performance of this machine.It's hard to find a decent machine for under $300. But I would consider this machine to be a mid-level machine for an entry-level price, especially with 15 bars of pressure. (I had started out thinking I would buy the Starbucks Barista machine which was almost $400, but after seeing a live demo at a Starbucks store, realized it did not perform well at only 8-12 bars of pressure. Very little crema). A good espresso machine should offer a minimum of 14 bars.Two side notes: I urge anyone who purchases an espresso machine to consider a conical burr grinder (I bought the Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder from Amazon). It's crucial to have a fine grind for brewing espresso. You'll know when you have just the right grind because after brewing the portafilter basket will contain a compacted ""cake"" of espresso, rather than a soupy mixture of water and grinds.I did not purchase my Saeco from Amazon, but opted instead to get it from Costco's website where it was $249 (for members or add 5% - or $12.45 - for nonmembers), including shipping and handling. Plus it could be returned to any Costco warehouse within 30 days, no questions asked, if not satisfied.",0

3428,"Good Coffee Quickly. I was amazed at how much I am enjoying my Flavia Fusion. I saw it at a boat show and tried some. My husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I really love it. I love the decaf house blend. It is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf. Decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it.The Flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee. I also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well. I like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks.It surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research BEFORE buying it. It is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee. The Flavia is a luxury item, not for a poor working stiff.Anyway, the Flavia is fast and simple and convenient. In fact, I'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now. Enjoy it",0
3429,"great product. This product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments I had received there.

I have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success",0
3430,I just love this. I first got introduced to the flip n fold while visiting my son.  He tends to be a neat freak ... in a good way.  I noticed his shirts were folded so perfectly (I know I didn't teach him that).  When I told him how nicely folded they were he told me about the flip n fold.  He got me one for christmas the next year.  I purchased this one for my dad(he is 80).  My mom had passed away a couple of years ago and he is now doing his own laundry.  He stayed with me for awhile and mentioned to me how he liked the way I folded his shirts so I purchased this for him.  He really loves it and shows it to everyone who comes to see him,0

3433,"I thought i must be crazy, but would buy it all over again. I love rice, but never rice I made at home.It never turned out well and I hated the cleanup.The Zutto makes perfect rice every time (I make long grain, brown and short grain Sushi rice in mine and they all turn out great). It cooks a pretty mean oatmeal too !I thought I must be crazy for buying a $200 rice cooker when you can buy other models for $15. The Zutto is made better and works better than any other non-comercial cooker I have seen or had rice from though. The rice does indeed turn out better than from other cookers, and guests often comment that it is better tasting than from their own cookers.Rice turns out perfectly whether you wash it or not (I prefer to wash white rice as I like the flavor better with the starch removed).The 'keep warm' feature works well too, and you can keep the rice for hours without it drying out.I have also become addicted to McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal since buying the Zutto. I have eaten it for breakfast every day that I have been at home since the first time I tried it. McCanns is another delacacy thats time consuming to make on the stove and clean up.With the Zutto it's a snap. I use two and a half cups of water to one cup of oats in the porridge mode. I load the cooker at night and set the timer feature, and wake up to the smell of oatmeal.Oh yea, the timer feature. You can set the time you want to eat, and the Zutto will adjust it's start time so it completes cooking at that time. You can have freshly cooked rice waiting when you get home ready to go. It automaticly goes into the keep warm mode when it's done cooking, so even if your an hour or three late getting home you will arrive to perfect rice.I DO AGREE, it should cost 75 or a hundred bucks less. But if it disapeared tomorrow, I would immediately buy another one.I started out storing it in my cabinet, but have made space for it on the counter since I use it every day (modt days twice). It looks good enough that it doesn't look out of place too which is good.",0

I debated between this wall-mount unit and the larger unit that sits on a shelf; I choose this one simpley because it hangs on a wall and therefore does not use any shelf space.  I wasn't sure that this smaller unit would hold all my plastic bags, but it is actually the perfect size.  Whenever I do  a lot of shopping, it gets really crammed full, but, since I use the bags for garbage, it also regularly empties out. You can stuff the bags and remove them from either the top or from the front.  My husband hung it in the utility room adjacent to our kitchen. Neat.",0

Her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment.  The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear.

I had almost decided that this type of mattress topper was just an unreliable product, but after reading the previous reviews from Amazon customers on this product I decided to give this one a try, knowing I would be able to return it if it didn't work out.

3451,"My favorite appliance... Using a Chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing, and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for.  After the water is brought to a boil, it's important to wait for it to cool just slightly (about 30 seconds) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter, wait for them to drain, and then fill the pot with water.  Want more than a single cup of coffee?  You wait for your first pour to brew, and then fill the filter again.Some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing:1. Taste: I don't know how it does it, but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter.2. Cleanability: Users can keep all necessary components clean (anyone who's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn't there when you bought it understands this plight).  Oftentimes, the most aggressive criticism of the Chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir.  Some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse, which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot, but if you're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass, then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean.  The best thing I've found: a baby bottle cleaner.  It's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls, too.  Brilliant!3. Electricity Free: As long as you can boil water, you can have coffee.4. Mud/Sludge: French press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee.  Don't get me wrong: I think that's good (I use a French Press when I'm in the mood), but the cone on a Chemex doesn't allow that at all.5. Style/Size: the Chemex coffee pot is a relic (designed in the 40s) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it's a wonderful, minimalist sight on any kitchen counter (and unlike electric coffee makers, easy to move if you need the space).Some drawbacks any purchaser should consider:1. Time: it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee.2. Cones: you can't run over to Wal-Mart when you use the last filter; you need to find a specialty store or go online, which means you need to plan ahead.3. Cold Coffee: no electric hot plate (thank god) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly.  You can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your Chemex can be warmed on the stovetop.  I think that's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor.  Just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee.4. Learning Curve: It does take some time to get the grind right, the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue.5. Cleanability: I know this is in the advantages column, as well, but it's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things.  To  submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff (which is a small pain) else it will get nasty over time",0

I have, however, seen it other places for much cheaper than here",0
3458,"So far, so good.... We bought this to get a blender and to replace a leaky (and piece of junk) Hamilton Beach food processor. We live in a cramped apartment, so anything that saves us space by condensing or being multi-functional is highly attractive. I've already broken the blender carafe. The replacement is only $20, but note that the plastic ring at the bottom is an extra $5! It's removeable, I had no idea. Both machines have worked well, and we've had no complaints. We like to make smoothies, and this has been great at crushing ice",0

Generally keeps our reds for a week, when otherwise I would taste a vinegar taste after a day.In reading some of the other reviewes, I can't specifically recall whether it lasts for 120 uses, but with my wife and I drinking 1-2 bottles a week, it lasts for months.  Well worth the money in my opinion",0
3460,"Nice lamp, but where's the white shade?. A very nice looking lamp for the money, easy assembly, but no ""crisp white shade"" as promised. It is definitely a beige shade with a rough fiber look and texture. You have to pull the shade open like the old fashioned collapsable tophats! They look real cozy, though, and are more substantial looking than they appear in photo. A good value; I am quite pleased",0

3462,"Professional quality kitchen tool!. Jaccard Tendermatic Meat TenderizerPros:1.  Professional caliber tool; strong, well engineered and manufactured.2.  Ergonomic design - handle bulges at top for good grip, it's comfortable, and no sharp edges.3.  Protective cover slides over the blade section, for storing the tool.4.  For safety, the blades are only exposed when the tool is pressed down firmly against the spring-loaded bottom plate.  Note: Those blades are sharp!5.  Stainless steel blades are replaceable.  Tool has three blade assemblies, with 16 blades in each one; see Customer Photos.  Search Google on ""Jaccard Replacement Blade"" if yours get damaged.6.  It actually does make steaks and other meats more tender and opens them up for marinade to soak in.Cons:1.  Takes longer to clean the tool if meat particles get between the blades.Summary:Excellent product",0
3463,"I love it!. I think this griddle/skillet combo is fantastic.  I use mine almost every day.  The only problems that I have encountered are: once I dropped it while putting it away, and part of the plastic base broke off.  This has made it more difficult to pick up, but it still works fine, and it was an accident.  Also, the nonstick coating has been scratching lately.  It does get a lot of use, but I was hoping that it would last longer.  I am planning to buy another one though",0

I would love to have this tea kettle with a train whistle. I couldn't hear it over my central air conditioning when it came on, but I am closer to the air conditioner than to the kitchen. I was always alert to listen for it, however, until that day I dozed off. I'm not writing to discourage anyone from buying this. I'm just forewarning anyone who is like me. :-",0

The low liquid capacity is our only gripe so far",0

3474,"I wish I would have bought this YEARS ago. This is an excellent product. If you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium, and making huge messes, walking in puddles, etc..and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks, this product is for you. Don't waste your money on cheap suction devices, and buy the python today! (sorry if I sound like an infomercial, I'm just an enthusiastic user). The python attaches to your faucet, you turn the water on full blast, stick the suction tube end into your tank, and you can drain your tank in minutes, or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes. Then, you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up (again, in minutes). I have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon, as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank, and what used to take me a whole day, now takes about an hour (to do all tanks). I like that I can vacuum the gravel, boy does this thing suck the waste up. This will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great! I was skeptical that this product would work, but am so glad that I bought it. Now I actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it.The directions are easy to follow~ even for people like me, who are ""direction impaired.""",0

We are pleased with the speed and performance of the T-fa",0
3476,"nice with a few flaws. A good looking tea kettle and seems to be quite sturdy, though I've only had it a few weeks. Not heavy, but dense enough to make you feel it won't ever burn through. The water has to boil like crazy in order for the whistle to get going, so you might wait longer than necessary if you're listening for that sound. The only real disappointment: there's a device connected to the spout that's constructed to seem as if you can flip it and it'll keep the spout open while you pour. But you end up having to hold that open with your finger anyway. Otherwise a fine and aesthetically nifty item",0

This is the BEST cleaning mop I have used though. Not sure what they have going on with those pads, but it cleans ten times better than Swiffer and even a regular mop head.  My floor hasnt come this clean since I laid it down. The problem is finding replacement pads. NO stores carry them. I called B&D and they advised that they have been on back order from their overseas vendor and that I would need to order on-line or through my local B&D service center. I did place an order for 5 boxes ($[...] per box of 10) and will hopefully get it within a weeks time.  They say to take Swiffer pads and wrap them around the mop.....oiy!

3483,"This itty bitty book light is an itty bitty wonder. I am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product. I purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and AC adapter about 5 years ago and I am still using it. I replaced the light bulb for the first time (replacement comes in the set I bought) last year when it started flickering and died. The book light has been used a great deal and I have accidently left it on for full nights before. I am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage...This is the only down side I can think of. The battery pack has its advantages... you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive. I prefer using the AC adapter. This might be why I never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time. It fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks. You can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want. Over the last year, my boyfriend has bought at least 3 LED booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them. He has been stealing my booklight to read with and I am force to use the poor night stand lighting. The funny thing is... I had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a LED book light. Now I am on this page again to buy another one for myself",0

It's bright enough to cast a shadow but not too bright for dark-adjusted eyes.  There's not much difference between the ""high"" and ""low"" settings, and both LED's are illuminated on ""low"".  They have a polarized plug and only fit one way in the socket, aiming the light upward and outward.  They don't feel warm to the touch even when they've been on for hours.

3503,"A quality product. I did a great deal of research on the internet before buying an automatic pasta maker.  I couldn't spend a fortune, but I wanted the best quality machine I could afford.  I read too many reports of broken plastic extrusion discs, motors that burned out, etc.  I learned that the Simac, Delonghi and Lello products were all related (so the quality of the older Simac brand seemed to be carried on in the newer Delonghi and Lello brands).  I liked their metal extrusion discs and the durability of them.  I felt a 2 lb capacity was ideal.  I bought this one.I was not disappointed.  I had read a great deal on the internet that the trickiest part is getting the dough consistency right.  Most (if not all) of the negative reviews of all pasta machines center around this problem.  When trying to decide which machine to buy, I do not recommend being influenced by reviews that focus entirely on this issue - that complaint is all about user error and has nothing to do with the quality or reliability of the machine.  (Experienced makers of home made pasta need to understand that the dough will need to be a different consistency in this machine than when done the manual way.)  I measured carefully and read the machine instructions very carefully (they bend over backwards to help you with this) and I didn't have any trouble getting pasta dough to extrude.  I found that a 2lb capacity is more than I needed for a family of 3.  I also felt that having metal extrusion discs is valuable in that when you trim the dough as it extrudes, you really run your knife against that metal a lot (in order to help get a clean cut).  I can imagine a plastic disc would wear considerably faster under those circumstances.  (You literally slice and slice hundreds of times for the smaller pastas - like elbows and such.)I would highly recommend this machine.  I was impressed by its quality and usefulness.  You will not regret your purchase with this one",0

I seriously thought about buying a new full set, they're always just a tad more than a single piece.  I'm glad I didn't.

I'm telling you, Corning Creations is the best thing they ever came up with and I just don't think a lot of people know how easy the clean up is.

3510,"Love the look, love the toast. The English take their toast seriously, and while I don't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast, I lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at Williams-Sonoma for years.  About seven years ago, when the dollar was still strong versus the British pound, I bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the UK for about $100 less than the then-going US price.  While it's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots (not a big bread item in the UK), I solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them.  The toasting is even, and I actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up, which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled.  Unlike others, I do not unplug it after each use.  Never had a problem.  The crumb tray is terrific, and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess.  I've had the $100 Krups and Cuisinart models, which burned out within two years.  This one is made for restaurant use, and I expect it to last a lifetime.  Worth every penny, if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools",0
3511,"Love this baker. I recently replaced my Pyrex because of safety concerns based on my experiences with a piece exploding.  I purchased several Chantal items after looking at ceramic and stoneware bakers that were much more expensive. Because of the price I decided to try a few pieces and see what happened.I am glad I did because I love all my Chantal bakeware and this baker is by far my favorite.  I like to cook on Saturdays and I usually find myself baking 3 to 4 main dishes (like chicken, pork chops, caserole,etc.) that will last a few days.  That way during the week I can alternate main dishes and only have to make sides/deserts.I purchased two of these and a couple of smaller pieces and they fit toether well for storage.  Food cooks evenly (I always check with a meat thermometer) for example chicken in the middle of the pan gets heated just as thoroughly as food on the sides.  These pans look nice enough for serving at the table and clean up like a breeze.  If you soak it the residue gets so loose that cleaning it only requires minimal effort.   I am very pleased with this purchase it was well worth the money",0

It's still sharp enough to cut a finger off, if you are not paying attention.  The blade does flex and this may be somewhat of an advantage when carving poultry.  The tip has bent so keep in mind this is a carver, rather than having the heft of a chef's knife.  I have the filet knife, paring knife and honing steel in this set.

I have an old hand-crank that I had always used to make the best ice cream, but it was a lot of work - churning fast at the beginning and then slowing down as the cream transformed.  With this churn, the motor is variable in its speed and churns at an excellent fast speed to begin; then, as the cream solidifies and freezes, the motor changes pitch and slows down to give you a wonderfully whipped and smooth cream.  I even made ice cream using just whole milk and peppermint sticks and it still turned out great.  Highly recommended and much better than any other electric churn you can buy.  I've had two other electric churns - neither of them could hold a candle to the White Mountain",0

3526,"Fabulous Espresso, Lattes, Cappucinos for a Great Price. I bought the DeLonghi Bar 85 (?) a little over a year ago. While a nice little machine that made excellent espresso, you do get what you pay for. The plastic frother attachment would wear down and become ineffective.  Finally, a little over a year after purchase, the boiler died.   So, I decided to bite the bullet and get a higher-priced version.  I was not disappointed!  The stainless frother attachment is super quiet and easy to clean.  I love Illy e.s.e. pods and looked for a machine that would accommodate these - no mess, no fuss on busy work days!  Great crema, quiet machine, and overall nice look.  It is a little big, and the water tank is a little difficult to pull up (especially if it is stored under the cabinets on the counter, like mine), but it is not a big deal.  My good friends have a $1300 machine, and I have to say this produces the same quality espresso, takes up less counter space, and is a better value.  Buy it - you won't be disappointed",0
3527,"A great buy. I wanted a big frying pan for the dozen or so times a year I  make a lot of potstickers, latkes, or even French toast.  We had something like this when I was a kid and it saw an awful lot of use. Surely, I reasoned, Grandma would not have overpaid for a frying pan, and I didn't want to, either.This pan has a nonstick surface which I initially thought would preclude getting a nice crispy finish.  I found that with an adequate amount of oil you get beautifully browned, crisp edges.It's deep enough for frying chicken.The controls are easy to read and use. There is a totally coherent instruction booklet. The pan is dishwasher-safe. The  lid fits securely. The plastic legs/handles, although reasonably sturdy, are likely the weak spot; but if they break the Presto company sells replacements.I plan to use mine whenever an extra-large fry pan is called for. This is a very nice item; one's grandmother would not think is frivolous but, instead, very practical. I recommend this simple and useful pan",0
3528,"Love the remote hygrometer. I've had other humidifiers, but this is my favorite.  The digital hygrometer prevents over-humidifying (I've ruined the paint on my bedroom wall several times when other humidifiers over-humidified the room overnight).  Also like the easy to clean heating element.  Finally, I had the reset problem that other reviewers discussed, but when I read the owner's manual more closely, I realized that the reason for my problem was that I was not waiting for the water to filter through the system before starting it (the owner's manual recommends waiting 5 minutes between filling and running the machine).  Don't know if the problem other reviewers had was different than this; if so I haven't had the problem they've had.  I love that I can leave this humidifier running ""unattended"" and not worry that I'm going to have to get out the paint rollers again",0
3529,Good product. Gave this salt crock as a gift and it met all of my expectations.  It was a nice size for the kitchen unlike some of the larger ones.  Overall I am satified with this purchase,0
3530,"Happy with purchase. Received ontime and in like new condition, works well and we like it alot",0
3531,"Malfunctioned within a year. While i loved the features of this timer, especially the ability to run multiple countdowns at once (i bake a lot and varying baking times require concurrent timers to prevent errors), my unit started freezing (apparently a common problem with this model) after about 6 months of use.  The buttons are indeed flimsy and pressing them a little to hard often would cause the unit to reset itself, losing any and all countdowns already in progress.this unit was not inexpensive... i'd rather have separate 'single' timers next time, especially a model not know for freezing up.I dot NOT recommend this time",0
3532,"Good, Bad & Ugly. It works REALLY WELL.Downside?Consumes a lot of electricity - so use on the really cold nights.  Not for full-time, sole heating use, in my opinion, but still cheap as a spot heater, when needed.Noise? Not too bad, and not nearly as loud as other reviews have noted.  Acceptable.We looked and looked, comparing numerous products, and frankly, we're very satisfied.Quality?  Good.  Well made and a bargain at this price when compared to more expensive, feature-deprived competitors.Oh, it's NOT ugly.  :-)  Fits most rooms' decor",0
3533,"This is the best deal - love it love it. We have researched and researched and finally took the plunge on this 10-cup neuro fuzzy cooker.  And we absolutley love it.  We eat rice at least twice a week and it is soooo easy to use and clean.  It is easy to cook 2 cup of rice on this even  though we bought the larger model for when we entertain.  My hubbie loves it and he used to be the 'minute rice' man.... and now loves the taste of the jasmine rice cooked proper.  He is a convert as he was harder to convince than me.I guarantee that if you love to cook rice and have hated the experiences of cleaning and under/over cooked rice .. you will not regret buying this appliance.  The rice comes out perfectly everytime from jasmine, basmati and brown rice.  This is the best out there... though dont go for the cheaper alternatives ,, you get what you pay for that is what my dad taught me and he has never been wrong.",0
3534,I love this spatula - won't melt. Nothing quite like a melted spatula you left in chocolate or caramel a bit too long.  This one won't melt - it's very sturdy but be warned &quot;large&quot; means LARGE.  You can't stick it into a can of evaporated milk or tomato paste very well to scrape out the sides.  I'd recommend buying both small and large - trust me you'll love both,0
3535,"good vacuum for the money. I've bought 3 or 4 vacuums during the last 10 years.  They've all worked okay, but there was always something that could be improved upon.  This one had features that appealed to my personal needs.  Number one was the suction power.  I've had vacuums that had more power, but wouldn't pick up a feather if it wasn't stuck just right.  This one picks up everything.  Number two was I prefer bags rather than emptying a container.  No mess.  This model had something I'd never had before which I find great, and that is the dirt indicator.  I have a motorhome which I thought I thoroughly clean every time. It took me 45 minutes the first time to clean that small area to the point the indicator light stayed green. I'm happy with it now and if it lasts for a few years, I'll have considered it a good deal",0
3536,"Just what I had been searching for. The first order for this arrived damaged and had to be sent back and replaced.  The second shipment arrived in better shape and is exactly what I was searching for.  However, it had a broken shelf which was replaced.  I am a very satisfied customer as the cabinet was exactly what I wanted, however I was disatisifed with the packaging and shippment process due to the damage ... although I must admit, the company was very responsive to my return and replacement needs",0
3537,"Very practical!. These may not be a cute as the tabletop salt and pepper shakers (the smaller round ones) but let me tell you that having the handles makes a world of difference when it comes to cooking.  You know the moment that I am talking about....your hands are covered in whatever you are making (flour, butter,chicken juice, ect.) or they are already pre-occupied by the spoon, oven-mitt, pot, or pan you might be tending to but you still need a little more salt.  What do you do?  You grab the handle...thats what it's there for, and you need not worry about it slipping out of your hands and onto the floor or into your food",0
3538,"Wonderful design, and it works well. The design itself is what made me purchase this item. I like the fact that it had a wider bottem than others which causes it to look much nicer when the wine poors down the sides. I highly reccomend this product for wine enthusiasts, and for non-wine enthusiasts it's still a nice purchase for you're table. I guarantee you will get many comments on it",0
3539,"Great pan!. Yes, it's a REALLY big pan!  A perfect cookware addition for the serious cook.  Surprisingly, the pan isn't as heavy as I expected and is a manageable size.  It will easily saute 6 to 8 chicken breasts at once without crowding and is perfect for large batches.  It heats evenly and lives up to the All-Clad quality I expected.  Easy cleanup, too!  Highly recommended",0
3540,A great training tool. I have a stubborn dog and this worked great.  I tried it on my self and it didn't really hurt as much as it was just startling and there were no after effects from the shock (no lasting pain of any kind).  I am ordering another one for my second dog,0
3541,"My clothes are saved. I am very pleased with this product. My dress shirts and pants are finally saved from touching the floor in my closet (huge pet peeve of mine). I also didn't realize how much more space I created in my closet, now I don't have to take up the extra closet space in the guest room",0
3542,"Really Great Measuring Spoons. I really bought these measuring spoons to match the Michael Graves measuring cups that I was planning to buy, and I am sure glad that I did.  The are the easiest to use measuring spoons that I have ever used.  The unique handles seem just right.  You can use them equally well with either hand.  It seemed with the dipper type spoons that I previously used I was always changing hands, and the spoon was always in th wrong hand.  With these you can forget that.  You can tell the size of each of them just by looking at them, but I wish that they would have embossed the sizes all a little larger and painted them white.  Black on black is hard to see, especially when the numbers are so small",0
3543,"A very sharp Knife. This is a great little knife.  It if very sharp from the factory and has kept its edge nicely.  The handle has a ridge that runs the length.  This makes it a little more comfortable than a completely cylindrical handle.  This is my girlfriend's favorite knife.  She reaches for it when doing small chopping jobs like herbs and onions.  It is very maneuverable and has a good heft for a small knife.  The blade is thick and makes such a small knife deceivingly useful.  I am a bigger guy and I usually use a 6"" knife, but I find myself reaching for this knife more often.A disadvantage to it being so think a blade is that it cannot double as a paring knife.  More delicate cuts, like thinly slicing tomatoes, are difficult because the thick blade pushes the tomato slices out.Overall, this is a very fine knife for the price.  Ergonomics on the handle are hit or miss.  I like the handle and so does my girlfriend but a few people have said it didn't fit right in their hand.  I would say those are the minority of people who have used this knife.  If you like to choke up on your knives this may be less comfortable on this knife than others as the round, blunt ending where the shaft meets the handle is not easily pinched when gripped in this way.",0
3544,"Great littke heater!!. If you want a heater for a small space this is the one you want. I have a back pantry and laundry area, about 12'x 12', that gets quite cold in the winter. This little heater does the trick. The first time I put it out, I cranked it on high and after a few hours I had to lower the temperature and put it on a lower setting.Be warned, that there is a slight odor when you first plug this unit in. The directions will warn you if you read them. It dissipates after a few hours.This is natural with ALL heating elements. It is very similar to what happens when you buy your first slow cooker.This is the first unit I have owned for the house. I have a second unit in my barn. I like the feel of radiator heat. There is no dry air or ozone smell that occurs like when you purchase a ceramic heater. I highly recomend this unit",0
3545,Pressure Canner does its job. My wife has used this canner several times since purchase and it works just great.  We already have an older model but she wanted two as she does a lot of canning.  This item should last forever,0
3546,Z Garment Rack Commercial Grade. This rack was very easy to assemble. The unit is very stable and moves very easy with the wheels. It will hold lots of clothes and is not under any strain to do so. I would recommend this to anyone needing additional hanging space,0
3547,"Works great. Compared to other siphons, I like this one because of the pump. The material it is made of is not the most durable when compared to the other siphons. Since I only use it every other week, I don't think that durabilty will be an issue. I saw this item at some of the big chain stores for a much cheaper price.",0
3548,"The best quick bread loaf pans ever!. This pan is a must have if you make quick bread (banana bread, pumpkin bread, etc.). It bakes MUCH more evenly than a non-stick pan. The loaves are spaced evenly apart to allow for even cooking. You will get nice, evenly moist loaves of bread with no hard, dry crust. Lightly grease the pans to prevent sticking and cleanup is a breeze. This pan is the best. Seriously. I have two and I love them.",0
3549,Best cup ever!. Best cup ever! Keeps your drinks warm for hours. Fits in my drink holder in my truck. Brews a good cup of coffee,0
3550,"Bladed Steel Cheese Slicer. I have purchased nearly a dozen cheese slicers in the past, all with wire cutters on them, and every one has failed within a year because the wire breaks or corrodes. This is the first cheese slicer I've found with a solid blade in place of the wire for cutting. It cuts nearly as well as a wire does and has the distinct advantage of being nearly indestructible. It can also be cleaned in the dish washer and is easy to clean by hand. I bought three - one for me and one for each of my grown children, all of whom love to slice block cheese for various snacks. Thanks, Amazon, for stocking this great cheese slicer",0
3551,"Great Product!!  Works for me!!!. Wow!!! When I saw this light and simple design, I was not sure what to expect. I used this for an entire day, working on a paper with my laptop. It really did keep my lap totally cool! It's light and comfortable! I also set the Lapinator Plus on the couch with my laptop on it. That worked like a charm, too! The underside of the Lapinator never felt hot to the touch.  My laptop doesn't shift at all, whether it's on my lap, the couch or the bed.  This is a great product, and worth the price, in my humble opinion! It's plenty sturdy without being heavy, yet it is not flimsy at all.  What an achievement in design and construction!",0
3552,"Works Perfectly. I didn't realize that I had ordered the unseasoned pan until after it had been shipped. No matter! It arrived midmorning today, and it took all of 90 minutes to season the thing according to Lodge's intstructions.I then cooked a batch of cornbread according to recipe on the back of the Alber's cornmeal box. I left the pan in the oven to preheat, and when the oven reached 400 I removed the pan, shot it with cooking spray, poured in the batter and sat back for 20 minutes. The result was perfect cornbread: the wedges popped right out of the pan without sticking at all. The hot set-up would be to have 2 of these pans- that would equal one standard cornbread recipe.  Excellent! And for only 10 bucks!",0
3553,"Good coffee pot, but... I have owned this coffee pot for a few years now.  Overall it is good.  The biggest problem is that the grinding is so loud, that it will wake the dead.  If you live in an apartment, condo or townhome, you probably do not want to get one of these.  It will wake up your neighbor",0
3554,"Soft with a good fit. We are verry satisfied with our Pinzon sheets, we had pruchased other more expensive sheets in the past and these were just as good if not better than the fancy name brand.  The two things that were a deciding factor in my purchase were the free shipping and the depth of the pockets, when the sheets arrived I was more than happy as they fit our pillow top matrice quite well and were ever so soft, I was looking for deep pocket sheets and these didn't say that in the description so I was not sure how they would fit. I have since purchased several more sets from Pinzion, including many of their plad ones.  Here in Alaska there is nothing better than a set of soft, warm, flannel sheets on a cold winter night. They are nice in the summer as well",0
3555,"Great Icecream maker!. I have owned this icecream maker for a few months now. Its great way to prepare homemade delicious icecreams.... Its available at Costco for $50. Its noisy but it makes great icecream in less than 30 minutes. Just like other icecream makers from Cuisinart, the consistency of the icecream is like a soft serve. So, if you like you can keep the prepared batch  in the freezer for few hours. This item is definitely a great gift for icecream lovers!! Enjo",0
3556,"Riedel. These glasses make a world of difference in the taste of your wine.  Compared to retail department stores, Amazon offers a very nice price for them",0
3557,"Great...but not for soft cereals. I love this item, it looks great in my kitchen. Very sturdy! My only complaint is even though the rubber that turns inside to move the food is very soft it will still make a mess of cereals such as apple jacks. Looks awesome with coffee beans though",0
3558,Love This Griddle. I absolutely love this griddle.  Pancakes come out perfect.  I grilled boneless chicken on it;  it came out very tender and didn't dry out.  It's so easy to clean.  Definitely worth the money I spent,0
3559,"Can't Stop Makin' Tarts!. This is a great tart pan if you like to make deep dish quiches, etc.  The false bottom comes in handy for  easy removal of the tart, but be careful when loading it into the oven!  While the sides of the pan are non-stick,  the bottom is not.  The sides and bottom should be buttered well.  I would  reccomend this pan to anybody who has always wanted to made tarts",0
3560,"Fuctional and easy to use. I bought this item over a year ago, and I use it almost everyday to make sugar free sodas. It has never failed, and is quite easy to use. I am planning on buying another one soon, just so that I can have a different color",0
3561,"not a bad find. Since it was a gift I did not mind spending the money on this set. Even though I may have found it somewhere else for a bit less. It is the exact color scheme I was looking for.  They were shipped almost immediately. They are cotton and fairly absorbent, so definately functional as well as pretty",0
3562,Great Cookware. This cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy. It heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before. It also heats very evenly. The only negative thing I have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon. However I think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or Pam fixes the problem,0
3563,"Great!. This contact grill-panini grill is great!  We moved into a 3rd floor condo without a place for outside cooking but since we bought this grill I can't say we miss it. This grill heats up extremely well, something my several George Foreman grills didn't do.  We like it for steaks and hamburgers, my husband says the ones I do are as good as he did on the grill.  It is also very fast; we grill thin steaks in 2-3 minutes; it took 10 minutes on our gas grill. We also like it for grilled sandwiches like Reubens; the bread comes out crisp and the center is completely heated through.  We like the temperature choices.  It doesn't have removeable plates - nothing to break!  They wash off easily; I put wet paper towels in it and let it sit while we eat.  I would recommend it to anyone - look for it in the warehouse stores as well.",0
3564,Very Nice Pans. Very Nice Quality Pans.  I got these pans and have yet to use them. They are nice quality and I will be excited to use them with my christmas baking next year. They don't recommend dishwasher use which is a disappointment to me but other than that they appear great.  Will work great for regular cookies and bars as well,0
3565,"NIce But Deadly!. We opened these little bundles of joy early for a Christmas party. My 62 year old room mate was delighted with the thought of having her own cocktail shaker....and a pretty one too! Moments later the joy was shattered (which it often is) by the slicing of flesh and an ensuing bloodbath followed. Laughing hysterically at this funny but painful folly, i decided to put the top on her cocktail shaker myself. To my utter amazement and sheer surprise i too sliced my finger open! thank goodness our trusty manservant was on hand to administer bandages and comforting words! So let this be a warning to you. BE CARFUL THE LIDS ARE SHARP!! A special thank you to Brabinger, the butler. (There IS a reason why people should not be mixing their own drinks and should rely on a trained professional!",0
3566,"Great shakers. The stove top salt and pepper shakers are exactly what I wanted.  I am using them to cook with.  They are big enough to hold a lot and so convenient.  I was tired of having to open the cabinet and look for the big salt and pepper boxes.  They look so nice in my kitchen.  The plastic covers are a bonus. I haven't used the plastic covers yet, but have them put away in a cabinet in case I need them for storage reasons. Smart move by the makers of these.  I am 100% pleased and highly recommend these salt and pepper shakers to others",0
3567,Great Bowls. These bowls are really great. I have been watching and learning about Fiesta for a long time. This was my first Fiestaware purchase. I will be getting more!!,0
3568,Mini Loaf Pans. These pans are the right size for baking individual items to take to work during the holidays,0
3569,"THE BEST PILLOW EVER!!. Really, this pillow is perfect in every way.  I have had neck pain so long i lost track. I found this on amazon, ordered 2 and what a great idea. If you have any type of neck pain YOU NEED THIS PILLOW",0
3570,"Superb ice crusher. This ice crusher is just EXACTLY what I wanted for my home bar. I positively did NOT want an ice shaver, which seems to be all the rage today. The size of the crushed ice pieces are much larger than shaved ice and perfect for drinks. The only limitation I have found is that you must not feed the cubes in too rapidly, which is not a problem. I am EXTREMELY pleased with this crusher and recommend it highly for drinks, shrimp cocktails, etc.",0
3571,"Doggie Gate. The quality of this product is very nice.  It's not as high as we thought it would be, but it will satisfy our needs for keeping our pet enclosed in our kitchen area, when we are gone.  Our neighbor will be tending to our dog (while on vacation)and we needed a gate for a wide doorway",0
3572,pretty alright. This little scale does the trick. Nothing fancy just simple to the point weighing of the goods. Its nice to have the storage container but I never really use it. I just like to know its an opption,0

3575,Super price for a super pot. Calphalon is always one of my favorite cooking pots.  This pot is great for chili but any stew or just cooking pasta or pierogies.  Great siz,0
3576,"Great convienence. Got this a couple of days ago and I couldn't be happier. Its quite and does a great job. It will only do small loads, so don't think your putting 5 pairs of jeans in. Make sure you install the bottom plate correctly otherwise it will sound like a jackhammer. The plate should stick out, not go into the bottom. Also if you need to move it, i recommend buying the rolling art from Lowe's for 25 bucks",0
3577,"Couldn't be happier with Global knives!. I muddled along for years with a collection of mismatched and mostly blunt kitchen knives before I found Global knives.  They are very, very good.  They hold an edge beautifully, are well balanced and with the solid handle and blade construction are hygienic and a breeze to clean.  Incredible value being in the medium price range.  I have a good collection of these now and expect to get many years of service out of them. I bought the Mina sharpener device too.  Works perfectly",0
3578,"Beautiful but........ Definitely focuses the flavor and aroma of the finest Hermitage, shiraz , etc......but the the glasses do not feel as delicate, and refined as my other sommelier series do. Maybe because they are hand made? I compared the ones I bought on amazon to another set at a local store. The glasses at the store felt lighter . Otherwise, the glasses are excellent!  Go figure? Oh, and there was a small bubble on one of the glasses. Not a distraction after filled with wine, but ..............$60.00 a glass !!",0
3579,Great Frozen Pizza Plate. My husband and I fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza. A Tombstone pizza fits great on this plate,0
3580,"Finally!. Finally, a coffeemaker that works and is easy to operate.  It's clean too, no nooks and crannies to gunk up with coffee residue.  The blue light is nice at night, it alluminates the kitchen just enough, so that i won't run into anything.  But most of all the coffee is brewed to perfection everytime.  I have used it at least 20 times and it's a breeze to clean.  I love this machine.  thank you.Denis",0
3581,Excellent Knife Sharpener. We have 1 expensive knife and several cheaper knives.  This sharpener does an excellent job of sharpening all our knives,0
3582,"buy from Witbecks. Miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure.  But I want to recommend the seller WItbecks--wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually Witbecks.  When DHL screwed up their delivery (an immensely crappy organization, but that's another story), he stepped in and sent another unit without delay.  Terrific guy, terrific price, terrific service",0
3583,"Choose your sweeper wisely. This sweeper is exactly what one would expect for $24.  It does a fairly good job of picking up pieces of things, though isn't a choice option for things like pet hair (unless you really want a workout.)  Also, it's best for smoother rug textures.Why do I own this?  My toddler is scared of the vacuum, yet scatters Cheerios liberally across the carpet.  This lets me get the worst of the mess while she's awake so less gets ground in.  Also, the handle comes in 4 slide-together sections.  We're currently using only 2 sections so that my daughter can ""help"" as the mood hits.  So far, so good!  I give this 4 stars because, like most things, it works ~slightly~ less well than one might wish",0
3584,"Best trash can Ive ever had. I love this trash can. It works perfectly. All you have to do when it arrives is pull it out of the box, put the batteries in, put a trash bag in and yoy are ready to go. There is a ring inside the trash can that holds your liner in place. Just simply wave your hand over the front and the lid comes open and closes by itself. It is a little noisy but I have teenagers so if the lid is opening then I know they have eaten something. lol..... Anyway enjoy the trashcan. Well worth the money!",0

3587,"I don't use them for canning... ...I use them with my FoodSaver vacuum sealer!  These jars are perfect for anything from grated cheese, flour, sugar, nuts, oats, cereal, chips - anything you can think of that is bulky.They work exceptionally well with grated cheese - I like to buy 2lb blocks of Tillamook cheddar, get out the food processor and grate the whole block.  Then store in the jars in the fridge.  Vacuum sealed, the grated cheese will keep for over a month easy, without drying out or molding.  Cheaper than the pre-grated, and less preservatives too.Love my wide-mouth jar attachment in conjunction with these Ball canning jars..",0
3588,Wonderful Set- I love it!!!. You wont find corelle sets easily in stores. But Amazon is selling almost all varieties of sets at reasonable price!! I bought mixing bowls and the 16 piece set along with this 7 piece set!! Its wonderful even for gift!! I loved my set very much,0

3593,"good. It's the first slow cooker I've owned and I have cooked one meal with it only, today, but I like it already.  It's $20 and it's basic (no power light for example, which feels odd for any kitchen device) but it has a good quality internal white ceramic pot and glass lid.  Three settings - keep warm, low, and high - and nothing else (no timer, no automatic way to switch from cook to keep warm).  I had read that some slow cooker lids rattle while they're cooking, but happily that problem did not show up, on low cooking anyway.  I cooked a meal for eight hours, and it did not show any signs of drying out, so I think it will be fine for leaving on low heat during the work day.   The internal pot lifts out for serving, and it cleaned up immediately I put it in hot soapy water.  Size is fine for two or three servings.  I'm now kind of glad I could not get the Breville slow cooker (good reviews but much bigger, and out of production) and opted for this because it's small and simple but it does the job!",0
3594,"Excellent Economical Pizza Peel. I bought this pizza peel for my son who is really getting serious about making Pizzas, from scratch, at home.  And I can say that it is serving him [and us] very well. The aluminum blade is sturdy, and well sized for a 16"" pizza. The handle is just about the perfect length for working in a home kitchen.  The materials in its construction are not exotic, but the peel is very well made with the blade firmly riveted to the ferrule, and the handle firmly and well crimped into the other end of the ferrule.  Delivery was very prompt.  An excellent value and a welcome addition to our kitchen",0

3597,"Very pleased!. I read the reviews here before I purchased this and they were right on.  I placed this under a 8X10 in my living room which sees a lot of foot traffic.  This was an area rug on Berber carpet. Before this, the rug moved constantly and we were always pulling it back to where it should have been.  Since placing this, we may only make a slight adjustment every now and then.  So, the product is well worth it.  Footnote:  I now have a thick pile nylon carpet and it moves even less",0
3598,"Cheese Knife. This cheese knife is very good quality, and every bit as good (if not better than) as our Cutco cheese knife, which cost many times more.  The design is similar to the Cutco knife in that it has holes in the blade to keep resistance down while cutting the cheese.  It cuts smoothly and effortlessly, and there are no wires that keep working loose (as in wire cheese cutters).  I bought extra ones to give as gifts, and everyone loves them",0
3599,"Has worked very well for me... I realize some other reviewers have had problems, but I haven't. This is my go-to turner, and it has held up very well. Strong enough for weighty items, but thin enough to easily slip under pretty much anything. The nylon has served me well with my non-stick pans",0
3600,"Durable but perhaps too heavy. As the description describes, this salt and pepper shaker set is stable and durable especially in the dishwasher. However, if one fills each shaker to capacity they become quite heavy, perhaps too heavy to be passed comfortably at dinner. The shakers are not demarcated and the head design is such that they would look substantially similar. One shaker has four holes and the other has three thus it become confusing as to which condiment is in which container. Still though, I will take durability over the other drawbacks",0
3601,"Great Water - lousy fit. I've changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years. I cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself. That said, I still have reasonable water pressure and here's the amazing thing, my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it. Who knew that for all my life, it was the water, not my hair. My skin is not as dried out...if I could work out the little glitches, it would be perfect. I own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it's fab for the price!",0
3602,"Excellent Value. I want to start off by saying that any review is relative to the consumers past experience.  Before getting this knife I was working from a cheap knife set so I won't profess that my opinion is going to be relevant when compared to other high quality knives.  For me the price was great and after using it I really appreciate how crappy the knives in my old set are.  It's amazing how much more enjoyable cooking is when you have quality tools.  So, if you're upgrading from a crappy set of knives you won't be disappointed.  If you already have a good set of knives and you're looking to replace one of them with this please read another review",0
3603,"Use for casseroles, cakes, or roasting. Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way.Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat.  Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials.Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to wood or plastic utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain.The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically. This pan holds 2 1/2 quarts of food, measures 7 3/4 x 11 1/2 inches internally, and weighs 6 1/2 pounds. 2 1/2 quarts is not a lot of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. This may be the pan for families from 2-4. Except for roasts, the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot.I find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese, while not so desirable for other dishes.  Add the Le Creuset 7 1/2 x 9 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease.  Some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles, pork chops covered with cornbread dressing, dinner rolls, baked squash, scalloped potatoes, cobblers, pineapple upside down cake, or bread pudding. The possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination.One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.PROS:Extremely versatileEfficient absorption and distribution of heatHygienic enamel cooking surfaceDoes not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavorsEasy to clean when not abused or misusedCan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the tableCan easily last a lifetimeCONS:Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 6 1/2 pounds",0

3607,"Great Quality backed by a Great Name. I got these as part of our wedding registry here on Amazon.I chose them because of the price, the name, and the number of pieces.  I recently opened it after the wedding and ... wow ... so many pieces in the box.  There's the 8 place settings, 5 serving pieces. Each place setting consists of: knife; fork; soup spoon; salad fork; teaspoon. Hostess set consists of: 6-inch sugar spoon; 7-inch butter knife; 8-1/2-inch serving fork; 8-1/4-inch solid serving spoon; 8-1/4-inch pierced serving spoon. 45 pieces total!  It was wonderful and handy when we had guests over and our regular place setting set didn't cut it.  After wash and use, when I put it next to my comparible-in-price-but-not-in-quality mikasa set I can really see the differece.  They have remained very shiny and no water marks or rust so far.I'm very happy with the selection",0
3608,"I love it!. We received one of these for Christmas and we can't stop using it.  This skillet heats up fast, is a great size for anything and absolutely nothing sticks to it!  It is perfect for making breakfasts which is why we are registering for another one for our upcoming wedding, that way everything we're making is all ready at the same time.  It also doubles as a buffet server which is always handy for entertaining.  I highly recommend one of these",0
3609,"Bathroom Wall Shelf. Well, considering that I was shipped the wrong item, this piece has worked out OK. The construction is solid, stable, sturdy and attractive.

3611,"Good item -- but read the manual. For the poor folks who are complaining about the ""EEE"" display, I haven't had the same problems.  Customer support for this has been really professional and prompt at the 800 number.  The ""EEE"" problem is a result of people not reading the instructions about not immersing the control panel in water.  Don't do it.  The panel is electronic and electronics don't work when they're filled with water.This unit is a good, solid fryer which I've had no problems with.The pros:Easy to use, easy to clean up.  Nothing has baked to my frier or my friends friers (death by EEE).  Even when frying ""trouble"" items like pastry or breaded items, the basket comes clean easilly.  The controls have positive engagement and are hard to accidentally push.  The unit makes a loud beeping when buttons are pushed and has a distinctive alarm.  You shouldn't leave the frier unattended, but you have enough peace-of-mind that you can work on other things in the kitchen while the fryer is working.  Another bonus is that suggested cooking tempetures are printed right on the unit so when the manual gets lost, you have some idea what did what.  The window is also a lifesaver as it lets you see what the oil is doing just in case anything goes wrong.The cons:The power chord is the most annoying bit and can be plugged in upside down.  Don't do it.  It says ""This side up"" clearly on the chord, but if you are absent minded or have limited eyesight, this might be an issue.  The only other problem is that the controls (the power button) faces the frying basket.  This is more of a pet-peeve then anything but if you need to get control of the unit in a hurry, you do not want to be reaching through hot oil splatter.  My suggestion:  Keep it on it's own power strip so you have yet another button in case of emergency.  Sadly, this gripe applies to almost all friers.  I also wish the lid was a bit better designed, the lid drops the inevitable condensation from the water into the oil until you get used to tipping it out (towards the basket handle).  Once you get the hang of it, the condensation dropping into the oil can be avoided.This frier, despite a few minor shortcomings, is excellent.  One of the nice features is that it heats up quickly and can maintain that heat even when adding and pulling out food.  The caution to that is that when the oil is disagreeable, it heats up quickly.  Be sure to supervise the frier.  I managed to do the boneheaded thing of chopping up mushrooms, washing them, and tossing them in without thinking about it and managed to cause quite a show in the kitchen.  Had I actually read the manual, there's a blurb in there to make sure food is completely thawed and dried which I did not heed.If you respect the power here, it's a great unit",0
3612,"Great!!. I bought this Raclette grill to add to an existing collection.  I was a bit hesitant because I typically do not purchase Hamilton Beach products.  I have to say, I like this machine better than my other more expensive European models.  It certainly is great value for money and easy to use.  I highly recommend it!",0
3613,"Dogsitter extraordinaire!. I paid way more for this than the current sale price at my local pet store ($26).  My bull terrier puppy had surgery yesterday and we were struggling to find something to turn his attention away from the stitches.  I put treats through the other side and only put one of the treat balls on the one end, saving the second for later.  He did manage to finally dislodge the treat, but even eating that took longer than his Booda Bimples.  So overall I'm very happy.  After he finished the treat on the outside, he had to find a way to get the other treats on the inside.  He's a 50# bull terrier puppy, and the large suited him well.  I did not notice any issues with him being able to handle it.  The material is durable and dishwasher safe, so it will provide plenty of hours of fun and the quick convenience of the dishwasher.  Highly recommended",0

It is very sturdy if you follow the instructions and add a little wood glue (inexpensive at any hardware store).  I preferred adding the wood glue because I did want it be sturdy.  It is a very nice neutral color that matches anything.  So far in the 2 years I have had it, nothing has gone wrong, it still is very nice",0
3618,"Macho Cheese Slicer. This is a hefty kitchen tool--large, heavy, chrome.  It fits comfortably in the hand and is easy to guide.  I'm not sure why there are three ""thickness"" settings, since I've always been able to cut both thin and thick slices with a grocery-store-type cheese slicer by simply changing the angle of my hand as I slice:  upright for thick slices, flatter for thin ones.  This slicer works very well for me, and I had no trouble removing and replacing the wire.  One slight inconvenience:  when I hand-wash the slicer, the roller (the ""adjustable"" part of it) always falls out and has to be put back in.  The slicer comes with a spare wire, and if you can remember where you store it, this unit should last for a long time.  I'd recommend it",0
3619,this was a gift. I had this shipped to my mother.  She had no complaints,0
3620,"Great So Far. I bought this locally to replace an old Rival deep fryer that just quit. The first one I brought home had a broken brace on the heating element. It was exchanged with no problem and the second has no apparent defects. After reading all the negative reviews I wanted to use it at least once before the 14 day exchange period was up. Like others I went looking for this model because it was one Alton Brown liked. The features he liked were the large oil capacity, immersion element with high wattage, thermostat, filter, ease of cleanup, and stainless construction. All make it a desirable machine. Euro-Pro's iffy quality control makes it something of a gamble. I put 5 liters of oil in it and fried up some vegetables as an appetizer for dinner last night. So far this is a great fryer. I have had the Presto Fry Daddy's and the Rival this replaced. This unit is much closer to a professional fryer you would find in a restaurant kitchen. It heats up the oil fast and returns it to temperature very fast. Food comes out crispy and not greasy. I am very pleased with the unit but will withold final judgement until it has proven itself durable",0

I am currently using this refrigerator as an accessory to a wet bar that I just installed.  It fits perfect and keeps the beverages and other items very cold.  It is also very quiet which is a plus.  The only downfall is the spacing of the racks.  It was very difficult to stack anything vertically.  However, the door rack and can rack made up for it.  For the price, this is a great, classy, little refrigerator",0

3630,"EVERYTHING GOOD YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS CAN OPENER IS INVARIABLY TRUE! -- WOW!,. IN A NUTSHELL: THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THE PRICE OF TINAs can openers go - there are none better, but the fact that these are available for around $10. and last literally forever seems too good to be true. Nevertheless, it is true. Like many other people, we have tried a lot of different can openers, some electric some hand held, but we always come back to the one that has always been in our kitchen -- 'SWING-A-WAY'.WHAT MAKES THE 'SWING-A-WAY CAN OPENER' SUPERIOR TO OTHER CAN OPENERS?3 components contribute synergistically to Swing-A-Way's success;1]- Very durable Tempered Steel gears with a cutting edge that stays sharp literally forever.2]- Ample leverage provided by a large chrome-plated steel turn-key to assure enough torque into the gears to open any can simply by hand turning.3]- Plastic coated Steel handles that facilitate penetration of the can by the cutting edges with just ordinary hand pressure.WHY ARE THESE LONG LASTING SUPER CAN OPENERS SO INEXPENSIVE?With only several moving parts made of easily manufactured components that are sold on a huge scale worldwide, it costs very little to make this product despite its excellence.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY BUT WE HAVE USED 'SWING-A-WAY' LITERALLY FOREVER WITH UNIFORMLY EXCELLENT RESULT",0

3646,"Knife Expert Approved; Multi-Functional and Durable. I am a stage performer as well as a chef. I specialize in contortion and throwing knives (often with my feet). I use the Wusthof so much in the kitchen, that I thought I would incorporate it into my act. I throw the knives at flying fruit and vegis and perform flips with knives between my toes and fling them at my assistants. Throwing knives are usually smaller, perfectly balanced, and forged from one solid piece. They require perfect tang as well and incredible strength. Wusthof is the ONLY high-end kitchen knife that meets these requirements.Although I have several chef's knives (global, henckel, wusthof, etc) I prefer the Wusthof both in the Kitchen and on Stage. I would never bring the Henckel or any other brand. Wusthof has absolutely perfect balance and tang. The difference from throwing knives is that kitchen knives usually have handles added to the forged steel. Unlike any other high-end brand, Wusthof's handle is extremely durable. In practice, I broke all other brands of knife, both handle and blade. I was surprised that my Henckels did not last very long (the 6"" 4-star pro's blade snapped in half and 8""'s handle came apart on one side). The quality of a Wusthof really shows when you use it for something it's not meant for and is still extremely reliable.And as you can read in all the other reviews, it is very sharp. In case you're wondering, I've never injured an assistant, but I did slit my foot open one time. I also stuck a head of lettuce to a vaulted ceiling",0

When I have to take a dish to a party I drag out the monster crockpot, but for just the two of us this is perfect! I can throw in a meal early in the day whenever I am not busy and it will be sitting there ready to eat when my husband rolls in that evening. In his job it's hard to tell when he'll get home so I really appreciate crock pots. No rushing around cooking at the end of a long day... trying to put something on the table when you are ready to blob out on the sofa. This one cooks a small meal and the removable little crock fits easily in the dishwasher, or in the fridge if there are leftovers or for cook-ahead items. It does a great job on small quantities of dried beans, too, giving about the equivalent of a canful the first day and then coming back out of the fridge the next day for the chili. I haven't tried pinhead oats overnight in this yet but that is something I will do, since I love oatmeal and my husband hates it. It'll make just enough for me. This is exactly what I was hoping for: crock pot convenience without the gallons of leftovers",0
3651,"off to good start. A few years ago I tried stir frying and liked it, except that I used a Joyce Chen nonstick wok that peeled after two uses.  After that I got a  Lodge cast iron wok that was way too heavy and got discouraged and gave it away.  Then I tried I a no-name carbon steel wok but was very ignorant about how to season it and could not understand why it kept rusting.  Recently I have had the urge to try stir frying  again and this time did my homework.  I chose this wok because it was carbon steel, and this time learned ahead of time how to season it properly.  This wok is also very sturdily made; you cannot easily bend the wok if you push on it; the handles are not loose; it is 2 mm thick; it has phenolic plastic handles that stay cool.I have properly seasoned and been using the wok with no rust or stickiness.  Learning how to season and clean made all the difference.  A good education and a well-made wok are an unbeatable combination!!See some of ther other wok posts for good seasoning tips.  I followed the directions that came with the wok and had good results.",0

It's a quick and quiet way to clean up.  I do feel like I'm turning into my Grandma though",0
3653,"The main selling point is inaccurate, misleading. I am a huge tea drinker and as you know, there are two key temperatures in the tea world: less than boiling (180F) and boiling (212). As far as I know, there are only two readily available variable temperature electric kettles on the market - the T-Fal Vitesse and one from Adagio Teas. I chose the former and have been using it for about 7 months.I assumed that since water can't get hotter than 212F, the highest (most right) setting would correspond to that. So the middle had to be roughly 180.  I've brewed dozens of cups of tea, some for guests, some very expensive with this assumption.Today I brought in a thermometer and found the following:Low - 175 FMedium - 212 FHigh - 212 FThis is outrageous!

3656,Gourmet knives are stamped blades. In reading the comments on these knives I noticed that there was a different type of metal in the Gourmet vs the Classic.  I checked my knives and then contacted a friend of mine that is into knives. He said that Molybdenum is put into the steel for forging purposes only thus it has no effect on the sharpness or finish.  Because Gourmet is a stamped knife it does not require this type of material.  I have the knives and they are great.  They are not the quality of the Classic but they don't carry that price either,0

3660,"Perfect for travellers. The smallest iron I've ever seen, but it works as well as the big ones. I travel a lot for work and this is a life saver",0
3661,THIS COAT RACK IS AWESOME!!!!. I LOVE THIS ITEM I BOUGHT AND IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION.THANK,0
3662,"if you love cookies. I purchased this pan through a different company. Cookies cook evenly with good color. Can be used with parchment paper, Silpat but also used with cooking spray. Worked great with all. Much better than other cookies sheets on the market. Definitely a must have if you love cookies.",0
3663,"Finest piece of cookware I own. I've always liked the Calphalon products, but I lost my whole set a few years ago. When I found this piece on sale at such a reasonable price, I snapped it up. I've never enjoyed cooking so much in my life. The copper heats the pot evenly and quickly. It's a dream to keep clean. The lid fits perfectly.The only thing I don't like about this piece is that the weight distribution on the handle is awkward. I have RMI which weakens my wrists and makes lifting and pouring off liquid difficult. A more ergonomic design to the handle would have been better.However the ease of cleanup, the perfect heat conduction, and the outright beauty of the piece make up for any awkwardness. I love it so much I'm asking for the rest of the set for Christmas",0
3664,"Great saucepan, excellent price. I bought one as a wedding present and when I saw the quality, I bought one for myself.  I love it",0
3665,Pfaltzgraff Empire Covered Butter Dish. Excellent product. I especially like the roominess of the cover...no more butter crawling up the sides! Yea,0
3666,scissor set only ok. this scissor set is not as sturdy as i was expecting from a henckels product. the all purpose scissors work well but the  pruning shears are very light weight and the open /close mechanism is very cheap. i dont htink they will last too long. probably why they were less expnsive for same set in other mags,0
3667,"No Kitchen is Complete Without These!. I love these dishes!  The proportions, color vibrance, surface wearability and chip-resistance can't be beat for the price!  I suggest buying a few colors to mix and match, these dishes come in so many great colors!  If you're considering a lesser-priced set (I was), spend a little bit more, the extra quality and classic style are definitely worth it",0
3668,"Nice kids pillow. My son loves it very nice. It is a nice gift for ages below 5. It got a good shape, nice grip to hold",0
3669,"Bunn Best Ever. I don't normally review a item after owning it just over a week, but today I decided I should review the Bunn BX.  Like I said, I have only owned it just over a week.  No problems setting it up, just follow the instructions.  It has made good coffee from day one.  I love getting it ready to brew and then going out to get the paper.  It's ready before I can get out the door.  With my old brewer, I still was waiting after I started reading the paper.This morning put the icing on the cake for me.  I had just put coffee in the basket when the electric went out.  I thought - No coffee.  There was a cup left from yesterday, maybe I could heat it in the microwave, but could not even do that.  Then it hit me, there was heated water in the tank.  All I need to do was pour the cold water in to push that hot water out.  So five minutes into a power outage, I was brewing a nice hot ""5 star"" cup of coffee.  I would think one could brew coffee even a half hour into a power outage.The only down side to the Bunn is that it is not a 12 cup.  But I can put up with that after this morning",0
3670,"best popcorn popper microwave or normal. makes the best popcorn I found.  Use peanut oil and any junk popcorn and it pops up light and fluffy.  Clean-up is not bad cause it's just a removeable bowl that gets messy.  I get about 6 bowls out of a concentrator before it needs to be replaced.  So a pack of 8 gets you about 50 bowls of popcorn.  The pack sell on amazon ""Presto 09964 PowerCup Concentrators"" for $0.99, so not a big deal.  I'm using a pretty small unpowerful microwave and have no problems.  I'm not sure why the previous negative reviews cause I think it works great.  It says dishwasher safe but I would not recommend it.  Like all plastic it will become brittle over time in the dishwasher.  I would love to have a glass version of this",0
3671,"Amazing Glasses. These glasses are amazing!  They don't just loom good - they are extremely functional as well.  You coffee can be extremely hot, yet you can't feel it on the outside of the glass due to the double wall.  I highly recommend these for any coffe or tea drinker",0
3672,"Goose Down. Love this comforter...It is just the right weight for what we needed..and fits the duvet cover perfectly...came faster than I expected, which of course thrilled me..",0
3673,"Wonderful, Healthy, Cookware. I was looking for good solid cookware that would allow me to bake salmon & vegetables (instead of wrapping in aluminum foil).  The deep dish washes out clean, and, when covered, keep the food moist and delicious.  I sometimes use a lid from another piece of Le Creuset cookware to cover this pan and turn it into a clay oven of sorts.  I am very pleased..",0
3674,External Hard Drive Case. Excellent product for protecting/storing external HD.  Amazaon had best price for this product,0
3675,"Picture is Misleading. I agree with the other reviewer--the picture *is* misleading.  Bissell does actually sell the pad/brush combination.  Amazon should strive to make sure the picture does represent the product or give a clearly seen disclaimer.  Conversely, I was not unhappy at all with the product received as I can use the pads a lot more than the brush attachment",0
3676,Great Deal and Very Handy. I bought one set of these and was so impressed I bought a second set.  The quality of the ramekins is great and the price is terrific.  I use them in the kitchen and also for sorting my beading supplies.  You really can't have too many of these as they are so handy,0
3677,Cute Cuisinart. This little Cuisinart hardly takes up any room on the counter.  It is very powerful and you must be careful so you don't turn your chopped veggies into puree,0
3678,"Good for its price. I was initially going to purchase the Eureka 169B Quick Up Vacuum (not cordless) because my boyfriend had the exact same thing, but then I found this cordless model and decided to give it a try. I have now been using it for 2 months without a problem. Good battery life - I can vacuum the living room, dining room and 2 bedrooms before recharging. No cord - no hassle! Easy to clean filter and dirt cup. Obviously this light- weight vacuum cannot replace my bigger vacuum, but it's convenient and easy to use for quick clean-ups. Really good for its price",0
3679,"The Best!. These are a purchase to go with Wamsutta sheets. My daughter likes extra pillows.These wash very well and are nice and heavy duty.  Pillow cases are usually expensive. For $2.99 at the closeout price, I got a bargain!",0
3680,"just beautiful dinnerware. The color, detail, and quality of this set is just perfect. I love it and have receieve many compliments on it.  I intend to purchase another set.  Very happy with set,and the manner it was packed and shipped",0
3681,"better than expected. I expected the typical dog toy, which lives about half as long as it normally does thanks to my dog trying to tear it apart. I'm surprised that it not only has lasted as long as it has, but doesn't have any loose stitchings yet",0
3682,"great for kids toys. I put all of my kids stuffed animals in these,  my kids can open them all alone and i can lift them up and toss them out of the way when more room is needed.  i'm thinking of getting more for the extra comforters and sleeping bag",0
3683,"Great Product. We've had this product now for about 3 weeks and use it everyday.  We just put in hardwood floors and needed something that wouldn't damage the floors, but picked up the dirt, dust, and our pets hair.  This product is extremely light, easy to push around (my 3 year-old loves playing with it), and has great suction.  There's been nothing so far that it hasn't been able to pick up.  After each use, it's simple to open up and dump out the debris.  It also has a charger unit that conveniently stores the vacuum until next use.  Well worth it",0
3684,"The largest version of Presto's gold standard in basic deepfry. THis is the family size edition of presto's popular Fry Daddy line of fryers.  I have had my own fry daddy for 6 years now, and my grandmother has had hers for over 20. Still the same basic quality fryer. Simple heat and fry. It has no lid or filter to filter the smell and prevent splatterlike some of the fancy models, this is just plain frying. Best rules, If frozen don't just drop the item in fast, and I tend to use this more in the warmer weather, when I can have my windows open. If you have a good Hood above your stove, that can be helpful as well. Otherwise, tasty food quickly, I still love my fry daddy. Its affordable and reliable.",0
3685,"Wustof Classic... worth the money. As a home user, I must say that I'm quite pleased with my purchase of this knife in the Classic line.  Had a few opportunities to use this prepping chicken already, and I've gotta say that it's loads easier to work with than the garbage knives I had at my disposal previous.",0
3686,"Love them!!. These end tables are very easy to asseble and look great. A great buy for the money. The bases were slightly scratched on one side, but I was able to flip the piece over so the scrath is underneath. No one will ever know",0
3687,Great product. Great knife.  Love the Unibody and is very sharp,0
3688,"tastes great, but too brown. This pan is very functional--makes wonderful mini-madeleines that are almost perfect--spongy, delicate, comes off in one piece easily thanks to the nonstick coating, heats evenly, etc.  My only complaint is that the shell-surface is too brown, instead of that nice yellow-golden appearance.  This seems to be a problem with nonstick pans in general.  Other than this, excellent pan.",0
3689,"Best Home Deep Fryer Ever. This is the best Deep Fryer for the home that we have every had.  Usually you have to have a fryer that is on 220 in order to get good crisp French Fries, Onion Rings, Tempura, etc.  But this baby does it on regular home 110 (I use the frozen fries and rings).  It is also easy to clean. I highly recommend it",0
3690,"Stanton. not just ice tea. These are my coffe mug stirers and mayo jar extractors too. We reach for them all the time. Stanton has a nice weight good quality, no dishwasher discoloration. arrived perfectly packaged",0
3691,"For the price works moderately well. I have a 3 1/2 year old Boxer that barks, cries, whines, and howls when I go to work...ALL DAY...I know, I recorded it.  I went to Petsmart and picked up this gadget.  Brought it home and it the manual correct button.  She bolted.  She hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes.  It reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and I don't crate my dog when I'm going to be away for more than 8 hours.So if I'm just running out for a few hours I stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if I'm going to work I use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar.My girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it.  Worth the price in my opinion.  Best advice is to take it home and try it.  Some dogs react to it.  Others don't",0
3692,"Works as it is intended. I purchased this to keep our cats off of the dining room table.  We've used it for a few weeks now and they no longer go on the table.  The only thing now, which is a credit to the product, is that I no longer have a use for it for the time being.  I'm sure my cats will find something else to climb on before long that will warrant its use again",0
3693,"Good, Solid Product!. This is my first food processor and overall, I'm very satisfied with it.  The mini bowl is very useful for making small quantities of pesto, sauce etc.  The processor runs quietly and efficiently.  The only negative I found was that it can be a pain to clean",0
3694,Handy cordless blender!. I love my Cuisinart Cordless Blender.  No cords to get in the way and easy to use when traveling by car--no power cord needed.  Charges quickly and can easily be taken apart for storage or transport.  This is my second CSB-44N--keep one at work and one at home! I should note that I have had my first Blender for 3 years and it still works great.  I run the blender until the battery is discharged before recharging it to avoid battery problems.,0
3695,"yes, goo gone works fine... I got these figuring that goo gone would work, and yes, it works fine (peel off the label, squirt on goo gone, wait a few minutes, scrape off with a plastic spatula (metal will scratch)), I can wash these in the dish washer without worry of rusting that plagues all other teflon covered cookie sheets I have owned... plus they have a mirror finish and hopefully will never need replacing, unlike teflon coated cookie sheets...",0
3696,"Great pot. My mother has one of these and really likes it so I purchased one and I too love it.  It is so easy to use and I have experienced no problems.  Bought one for my sister and her husband for Christmas and they also love it.  I would have to say the other reviewers were unlucky, there are always some lemons",0
3697,"Very Sturdy. Excellent quality and rich color.   I tried it as a skillet, takes a while to heat up . . . I think this would be best oven roasting or to saute onions,  followed by stove-top roasting.   Very heavy, of course, and the lid, too, is heavy enough to hold in juicy steam.This is a large piece.  You could prepare a meal for four.   You want to be smart in how much you move this around.  With hand trouble, I've learned to use straight wrists to carry it close to me (when cool, of course).   Then I take the water or food to the piece, cook and serve from it right off the stove . . . cool down, and ""hug"" it to the sink.   I used smaller pieces of a similar brand for smaller meals.  With care, this should serve you for a life-time.",0
3698,"great tray. The ice cubes come out intact - not chipped or cracked.  To get them out, push each cube from the bottom with your finger.For fastest and easiest results, wait for 5 minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer. This way, the ice cubes will pop right out. If you don't wait, your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out",0
3699,"great collar. this collar doesn't feel as rough as most--its soft and looks comfy. but it is totally durable. i have a jack russell & my little guy pulls & tugs and is pretty harsh on everything.  i would buy this again.  plus, it's super cute!",0
3700,"Great deal. These sheets are a great deal. They are very soft and comfy. They are oversized a little, therefore they fit very nicely",0
3701,"Great Blanket, very comfortable. I've had this for a few months now, I've found it to be perfect except on very cold nights, but then I add a comforter.  Also, it's machine washable, and came out very well which was a bit of a surprise considering it's filled.  Very please",0
3702,Great yet not sound free. excellent although the plastic is not sound free while the child tosses and turns in bed.,0
3703,"Great sewing machine value. I highly recommend this sewing machine.  I purchased it in January, but wanted to use it awhile before writing a review.  Since then, I've used it to make 5 large drapery panels and it's been a wonderful machine.  Several of the panels I made were lined and made of heavy fabric and the machine handled it well.  I experienced a couple jams on the really thick folded over portions, but nothing that wasn't easily fixed.This is the first computerized machine I've used.  I was accustomed to an old heavy duty Singer.  It felt very light at first, but I've grown to like that aspect -- it's much easier to put it away when not in use.  The machine was easy to learn; it had a very clear instruction manual.  My favorite features so far are the blind hem stitch and the self-threading needle",0
3704,"Sturdy!. These cups are larger than they appear!  And very strong and sturdy - a thick ceramic.  I use them every day to microwave eggs, etc.",0

3707,"the best dog bed. My dogs love this bed.  And so do I.I have two chihuahuas, although this bed would fit a dog up to at least 15-20 pounds.  My dogs always go straight into this bed, and love to cuddle underneath the covers.  One even prefers it to sleeping in our big human bed!  Every time my dogs are tired, they retire straight to this bed.The bed is machine-washable, which is really nice because the dogs stay smelling good after you bathe them.  In fact, when the bed is in the wash, they miss it!I do not think the person who gave the bed one star gave it a chance.  She said it tipped too much.  The bed is very fluffy when it first arrives, and after it is washed.  But it flattens out very quickly, and you can speed that up in under five second by hand",0
3708,"Good price for solid, warm flannel duvet cover. I bought this a few weeks ago on amazon and loved it within the first minute of snuggling underneath. For this price you can't beat - super soft and super warm. Highly recommend",0

3710,"Best floor cleaner yet!. I have several rooms including my kitchen that have white shiny ceramic tile floors with white grout.  No matter what I used to clean the floor I had to dry it as I cleaned and most often within a day or two it looked hazy or smeary.  Since using this steam vac I can go well over a week between cleanings and the floor never looked better.  The steamer removes surface dirt from the grout, so if you're buying it primarily to clean grout expect to still have to use elbow grease or chemicals.  It is too messy to be practical for cleaning windows and it didn't do very well cleaning soap film off the shower door.  It did, however, do very well on mold.  I also love it for cleaning my jewelry and the silk plants in my freshwater aquarium!  No more brown spots on the silk plants.  Best part of all the things I've mentioned--NO CHEMICALS to inhale or contaminate the environment.  The unit is sturdy, heats up quickly and includes a lot of handy attachments.",0
3711,"not a gimmick---the real deal. The Riedel ""O"" concept glasses may take a short while to accept, but once one realizes that a quality wine glass does not require a stem the rewards are many.  The ""O"" glass line of products have made legendary glass maker Riedel's products affordable for the masses, while injecting an element of practicality for daily use.  As a current owner of both traditional higher- priced Riedel stemware and these newer products, I find our ""O"" glasses are getting much higher use.  They truly do enhance the flavors of good quality wines, while helping the wine drinker collect multiple glass ware designs at reasonable prices. I now have five different ""O"" styles on the shelf, yet these wide mouth Chardonnay glasses seem to get the biggest workout:  they somehow do have the capability of bringing out the nuances of a wine, even for us less sophisticated buyers.  Plus, my wife loves popping them in the dishwasher!",0

They hold quite a lot before changing and they don't tear apart as some other brands have done.  I am Very satisfied with the quality & the size is perfect for my needs.   They work so well that this is my second order.   A very very good product.Thank you,~~Trish~",0

3715,"Our cats are spoiled - perfect for indoor cats!. This is the best - snaps on easily, cleans easily & works just great. Our cats love to pull out the grass just like they were outside.  They love it and it is a great conversation piece just like the Drinkwell.  Our cats are truly spoiled!",0
3716,"Darn good little vac. I have had every kind of vacuum you can think of. Even a Kerby, I am embarrassed to say. I have 4 dogs and therefore A LOT of hair and dirt. The first time i used this vac, I had just had my carpets cleaned the week prior and vacuumed the day before. I was amazed/appalled at the amount of hair and dirt one pass over my carpets made. I, too, have a lot of tile and find it works well on hard surfaces as well. For the price, you can't beat this vac!! Take this coming form what my ex once called a vacuum addict. I LOVE to vacuum:-) If the noise bothers you, pop in your Ipod",0

3718,"Best Grill I've Ever Owned. This grill was recommended by Alton Brown of Good Eats (FoodTV).  The grill came with explicit care instructions for seasoning the cast iron grills.  I have used it a half dozen times now, including adding an after market rotisserie.  Fantastic temperature control by raising or lowering the coals, or banking the coals away from the food in the multiple compartments.  More surface area than I've ever had before.  Very easy ash removal.I recommend getting a vegetable oil spray and coating the cooking surface after each use.  Easy to keep seasoned",0
3719,Great Bag Holder. This product just greatly reduced the space that bags were taking up under my counter.  Great organizing product,0

We love it, however, I couldn't give it an actual five stars as we do have some problems with the sugar leaking out a little and being somewhat messy.  However, it is great to keep the children from using too much sugar.  I would recommend it",0
3721,"If you only buy one toy for your dog... This is absolutely, hands down, the best toy we've gotten for our dogs. We own three sets of these in varying sizes. Because the balls are plush, they will wear out- this is not for your destructive chewers. Our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day. Before leaving for work, pop a couple of treats inside and you're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks.",0
3722,"In love with Bobo. My mini-doxie just loves his Bobo. Like others, we saw the Loofa dog on the Petsmart commercials. Remi loves any plushie that squeaks, so we decided to get one. He loves it!

3724,"Our cat barely leaves her mat... We adopted a feral cat and bought this thermal mat because it can get cold in the garage (which is where she lives). It makes a tiny bit of crinkling noise when stepped on, but she wasn't bothered by the sound at all (even though she is feral and still a bit skittish). The mat is made of plush, cozy fabric and is machine washable. Our cat loves the mat and hardly leaves it on days that are a bit chilly. It seems to really work because she also has a pet bed and a bed made out of blankets in the garage and she seems to prefer her mat. Definitely worth the price",0
3725,Works great. I put this on our wedding registry 2 years ago and was delighted when we received it as a gift. It has worked perfectly from day one! Easy to clean (if cleaned right away) and feels very sturdy. Our only problem is that the litle cleaning brush it comes with found it's way into our garbage disposal and was pretty chewed up. It's going to be difficult to replace this small part,0

3729,"Really makes a difference!. We just added this topper to our already cozy mattress and WOW - it made it EVEN more comfortable - it gives a great ""squish"" factor to the bed.  It also helps to buffer you from the movements of your sleeping partner- it sort of absorbs their movements and keeps you perfectly unaffected.  The only thing that i have to say is that there is a ""new foam"" smell - that WILL take over the bed - it says to allow a little ""air-out"" time - but who can resist immediately putting on the bed ?!  I would definitely suggest this product!!! :",0
3730,"Nice Heater, Love the Remote!. I really like this heater, has lots of functions and the remote is awesome.  I use it under my desk at work, it's great because I can place it further back and don't have to get on my hands and knees to turn it on and off.  I also really like the Oscillating feature.",0
3731,"great kettle. I really like this kettle. It heats water very quickly and shuts itself off if the water is too low or is boiling. The only thing I don't like is the silver matte finish. When I ordered it I thought the top was a brushed metal and its not. Its plastic made to look like satin nickel  finish - but really doesn't in person. The glass carafe does look great sitting on the counter and compliments my contemporary kitchen. Its also offered in the shiny finish which looks much better in person, but is still only plastic",0
3732,"Great sheets for a great price! & deep pockets!. I got these at a great price so my expectations were very low.  I usually spend as much as $90 for a pair of high thread count Cal king sheets.  But it seems they wear very quickly so I started shopping for an alternative & I ran across these.  I really thought they were going to be cheap & scratchy but they are not.  Not only are they plenty soft, they are beautiful!  The embroidery is a lovely touch.  My only complaint is that they have sold out or I would have bought at least another 4 sets for future use!  I love the mint color, it is very pretty!I was also afraid they would not fit over my deep mattress & featherbed on top but there is ample room for both. They fit much better than the expensive sheets I have bought in the past & I don't have to work up a sweat to make the bed anymore by pulling & tugging until I get the fitted sheet on the bed.I would definately recommend these, you will be pleasantly surprised!",0
3733,"Previous version has worked for 10+ years, no mold. I think some people are distorting reality on this product based on another problem in their refrigerator and blaming it on the Brita.  I've used the previous generation of this product in all different parts of the USA in various refrigerators, and I've never experienced mold.  I can't see why this design is fundamentally going to be different.  My guess is people have a mold problem in their house/refrigerator and like any mold, it is seeking the moisture.  CLEAN YOUR FRIDGE... ;)I don't wash this once a week, more like once a month.  The water doesn't pick up weird tastes or smells, but then again, my refrigerator is clean.  I find it convenient to use, not so much to fill, but it still works as intended.  The version currently for sale may have a leak problem, I can't say yes or no, but the one I have has not leaked in all the time I've had it other then once when I determined the spigot needed to be tightened.All in all, if you are tired of filling up pitchers constantly, and find the full pitcher heavy and spill prone when you use it, this product is for you.  Also, because you don't have to tip it, you can fill it with water and get a glass almost immediately even as the rest of the water is still filtering.  In a Brita pitcher, you must wait for all the water to filter before you can even have a glass.  This feature has come in handy when doing things like filling pet water bowls, fish tanks, etc.I'd give it five stars, but I find it a bit cumbersome to fill",0

I washed these super hot and dried them in the dryer first thing.  They are fine and lovely so if you have 1970s bad experiences with textiles from India, be assured that things have changed for the better.  This is the cheapest price I have found for dishtowels so far.   I'm trying to cut down on paper towel usage especially for drying my hands so this purchase alleviates a small degree of dismay at my pollution of the planet.I use these all the time",0

The suction is powerful -  I have had no problem ""picking"" up dust, hair, Christmas tree needles and other small debris. With no bag to replace, the machine is easy to clean. The only caveat I have is that when using the Dustbuster for the first time after you have emptied the receptacle, try to keep it away from anything that might be blown away, as some residual dust (albeit a very small amount) and air is emitted from the side vents",0

I'm waiting for a replacement part, but I'm enjoying the desk with no drawer.

3748,"Some Tips From an Owner. I've had this coffee maker for several weeks now, so if you're considering it for your home or office, please read on for some important tips I learned first-hand that you may want to consider prior to your purchase.First, the drawbacks (they are all surmountable, as I will explain later)...(1) This sucker is quite large.  And as mentioned in the other reviews, the typical kitchen cabinet clearance means you will not be able to use the top burner unless you pull the unit out or keep it somewhere that is clear of overhead obstructions.(2) You must keep the reservoir filled with water to brew coffee.  Depending upon how often you use the machine, this means water will sit in the coffeemaker and may become ""stale"" between uses.(3) The machine takes 13 minutes to warm up before it can brew.  That means if you want the coffee maker to be ready at all times, you need to leave it on.  That means it's drawing electricity throughout the day, 24/7.(4) You can brew no fewer than 4 cups of coffee at a time, or it will not displace water from the reservoir properly.Now to the strengths...This machine brews a good, hot cup of coffee.  Go to any coffee shop or restarant and see what they use.  It's usually a Bunn or other large-size commercial maker that brews quickly and uses an incoming water line and drip filter basket. That's basically what the Waring is (without the water line) and it's MUCH better built than the home-use Bunns.I did a lot of research before buying this coffeemaker.  One of the best resources I found was a coffee issue of Wine Spectator that had all of the ins and outs of coffee, including recommendations for coffee makers.  According to WS, you need at least 1200 watts of power to get good extraction from the grinds. The Waring puts out 1475, so you've got plenty of power.  The machine also brews quite fast - an entire pot in approximately 4 minutes.  Here again, this is another advantage of this machine.  To brew a good cup, you want the hot water to come into contact with the grind long enough to extract flavor, but not too long, or it will also extract the bitter components of the coffee.  Because of its fast brew time and high power output, the Waring is well up to the task.  The brew is hot, with good flavor extraction and no bitterness or burned aftertaste.Still interested? Then first, order the coffeemaker from Costco online.  I picked mine up for $100.  I then went to the Waring web site and downloaded a $30 rebate form (you'll need to check if the rebate offer is still active).  The end result?  I got a $269 coffeemaker for $69!Next, purchase a gold filter basket.  I found one for about $10 at my local Wegman's.  You'll need one that fits an 8-10 cup basket.  You can also order Swiss Gold coffee filters from Sweet Maria's that will fit the Waring, but they'll set you back about twice that.Third, if you're worried about stale water, turn it on and run 3 full pots through it.  The machine displaces a portion of water equal to what you pour in, so you can flush the entire coffeemaker this way.  Remember, it takes less than 5 minutes to brew a whole pot, so flushing the system will not take that long.  (That said, the water issue is the sole reason I withheld the 5th star.)Fourth, DON'T LET THE COFFEE POT SIT ON THE WARMING BURNERS!  As soon as your pot has brewed, transfer the coffee to a preheated thermal carafe.  You can pick these up at a Ross or Marshall's for about $6-$8.    If you leave the coffee on the heated burner, it will burn the coffee!  This is especially true as you get down to that last cup in the pot. Get in the habit of using a carafe.  Believe me, this is one of the best things you can do to ensure your last cup is as good as the first.  In my opinion, this makes the point about the upper burner moot - you shouldn't use it anyway.If you don't want to leave the machine on 24/7 but don't want to wait 13 minutes to brew every morning, I've got a simple solution for you: buy an appliance timer.  Just set it to turn the machine on when you wake up and off when you leave the house.  Problem solved.Lastly, if you usually brew less than 4 cups and/or do not want a big machine, save yourself the expense and buy a French press.  They're a bit of a pain to clean, but they do make the best tasting coffee (in my opinion).  If on the other hand, you want a workhorse machine for a great price (read Costco section) that brews up a pot of coffee for guests / parties in no time flat, I recommend the Waring Pro.",0
3749,"Just the thing for my vintage recipe. When I received this item, I was surprised how small it looked! There is a big difference between my 9"" pie plates and this 8"" one. However, it was just what my grandmother's vintage pecan pie recipe called for. For years, I had compromised by using my 9"" baker, as it is pretty hard to find 8"" ones today. This baker was ideal for my needs, as well as a compliment to my varied line of Fiestaware. I love it",0
3750,"Good value and powerful. I purchased this unit just over a month ago. It arrived in less than a week. I've had no problems with it yet. It is truly all metal except for the splash guard/ingredient chute. To address some other reviews that had me concerned. The head doesn't slap around. That is a warranty issue for her. It does walk with big stiff dough recipes such as a two loaf all wheat. Simple physics, considering size and weight, tells you at medium to high speeds it will. Kinda lets you know it is a powerful electronic speed controlled mixer. I can easily steady the base for the few seconds to finish mixing. All other mixing jobs are done with ease. I, personally, like the tilt head. All stand mixers will require side scraping with some recipes, even the expensive KitchenAids. Although I made a five bar cheesecake yesterday and as I was watching the eggs, dropped in at the side one at a time, they were all fully captured and mixed in. I usually scrape once at the beginning and it spins into a dough ball at the end anyway. There is a dimple at the bottom of the bowl to help pick up added flour during the mix. Speaking of KitchenAid, have you read the reviews of those ""attachments""? Besides being expensive they say all of them suck. It seems you can buy better and cheaper items to do the same thing taking up the same amount of space.So far I've made 4 loaves of baguettes, 4 loaves of wheat, 2 loaves of sourdough, numerous cakes, batches of cookies, and of course a large cheesecake since I've had it with no problems. (Now you can see why I needed a strong stand mixer! My church loves me now too!) The key is to read the instructions more than once to ensure you understand how to operate this model. It has some cool recipes in there too! And yes, it is very easy to clean as well.If you want a mixer to crank out mega-loaves of all wheat bread daily, (commercial), then this is not it. If you want to make great bread, dishes and pastries for your family then this can't be beat at this price range with this much power. After all, as one consumer already stated, this is a ""Consumer Reports best buy"". I've had a Sunbeam Heritage, (like the one shown on the Cookin In Brooklyn show), and contrary to popular belief there is NOT a motor under the bottom pedestal. It's great for everything else but gluttonous bread dough's. A white loaf every once in a while, maybe. But, I wanted to be more artisan and organic with my breads so I upgraded.Note: the short time I've had it is the only reason I've given it 4 stars. For me, longevity counts as one star.Hobby Baker",0

3757,"Best knives!. I loved my Shun Classic 6.5"" Santoku knife, so I purchased a 6-piece set (except my set came with a 9"" serrated bread knife instead of the utility knife).  Shun is the best!  For the most control and best grip, I was told to hold the knife close to the blade with my index finger on the metal ridge.  It seemed a little awkward at first, but it's very comfortable once you get used to it!  I love the weight of the knives, the wooden handles, and the sharpness of the blades.  They do, however, need to be sharpened occasionally (I judge this by how well they cut through a tomato).  I was told that you should use the boning steel every time you use a knife, but I have never used it.  Instead I've been using the MinoSharp Plus sharpener, which sharpens the knives extremely well.  If I could only have one knife I'd get the 6.5"" Santoku (not in this set) because I use it far more often than any other knife.  However, the large chef's knife is much better for cutting large, hard foods like squashes and melons.  I love the multi-functional scissors (they come apart so you can sharpen them and clean them well), and I like being able to protect my knives and keep them together in the wooden block.",0

3759,Handy. These shakers hold a large amount of salt and pepper.  The plastic covers are great for keeping dust and moisture off of them.  The fact that you can take the wide lids off makes them easy to fill and easy to use when measuring for recipes.  I really like them,0

The response time of this thermometer is pretty decent in its price range: it goes from freezing to boiling (or back) in about 15 seconds.The measurement range is OK -- at a maximum of 302 F you won't be able to use it for deep frying or melting sugar, but it's more than sufficient for measuring meat/pastry doneness.All in all it's a decent choice if you just want a basic unit for everyday tasks. If you need auto-off or a Celsius mode, look at similar Taylor models for a little bit more.The next significant step-up is the Thermoworks really-instant Thermapen at a whopping $80 (sold under the name ""Digital thermometer"" on Amazon - see B0001VWRCC)",0
3762,"Excellent product, care and feeding needed. I have owned this for about 9 months and gotten nearly 1000 uses out of it (it counts for you). It can equal most coffeehouse product you are likely to find, but as others point out, it is far short of what an enthusiast can create from more traditional equipment. You may also find the crema coffee settings to be something of an acquired taste (but you can make an Americano in just one more step, which is always great).Also, we went through a brief episode in which it would refuse to brew anything (as if it didn't have the power to punch the water through the puck of coffee). I remedied this with a descaling cycle as well as wiping out the parts above the removable tray thoroughly. (I use filtered water in the machine, but the descaling seems to be a more serious cleaning than the normal automatic cleaning.)Given this, I would recommend keeping large stock of cleaning supplies and at least doing the normal cleaning every couple of weeks, rather than awaiting the machine's automated recommendation to clean. My understanding is that there are no dirt sensors driving these messages. It is just a function of the amount of use.Overall, I would buy this again for certain, and if/when it dies I will be looking at one of its more expensive siblings, not at other brands.",0

I tried Dannon plain yogurt as my starter.  It worked, but the yogurt wasn't nearly as good.  The Euro Cuisine yogurt starter tastes much better, and after the first batch, it ""brews"" up in only three hours.  I think the bacteria are really lively, which is probably a bonus for our gut, too",0

French White is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money",0
3766,"A Good Machine... I bought this vacuum strictly for the basement(where our Home Theatre is set up).  It was a pain in the *ss carrying our canister up and down all the time, so I happened upon this cleaner on sale at Home Depot for a mere $70.00...  I was initially skeptical at first, I mean a $70 vacuum?  However, I purchased it anyway, knowing that I would be able to return it if I wasn't happy.  The setup and assembly was fairly quick. The instructions were easy to follow and featured step-by-step illustrations.  When I had everything ready to go, I decided to give it a ""test run"", and I was impressed.  I was amazed at the junk our Sears Canister was leaving behind, as I watched the cat hair and dust swirling around in the collection bin.  My only complaint-and this is common with bagless vacs in general-is that you MUST clean the filter off after every use, otherwise they tend to plug up and overheat the motor.  This is especially true if you have multiple pets, or longhaired cats.  In conclusion, this is a good machine.  Strong suction too.  The attachments include an extension wand for above floor cleaning, crevice tool, and dusting brush.  The dustbin simply snaps off in a jiffy, and the filter is washable/replaceable.  This is what I like to refer to as a ""second vac"", when you simply want a machine on another level in your home, without having to lug your main vacuum all over the place.  I've owned it for about 5 months now, and so far, no complaints.  Just keep it clean and you'll be set.  Also, pay no attention to that one review below.  This is obviously referring to a totally separate model.  I'm happy.",0

I also had the water cap problem at first. If you leave water in it, the lid will expand and later the cap will fall out or will not screw on again. The solution is to empty the tank after using it and let the tank and cap dry. Don't screw it on too tightly afterwards- the lid might shrink afterwards and be hard to open again (happened once). I also drain the leftover water over the sink after using it. It's a little bit of work, but worth doing to prevent any further mess.",0

3771,"the best juicer available. I highly recommend this juicer. I live in Florida and have a huge pink grapefriut tree as well as an orange, lemon and lime tree in my back yard. As you would expect my juicer has to be heavy duty and easy to use and clean. I have purchased and discarded most other juicers due to 1.t ook up too much counter space, 2. too flimsy, 3. too hard to clean, 4. too noisy, or 5. totally ineffective, etc. This juicer is elegant, the rack and pinion compressor will take all the juice out of medium to large fruit (small fruit you need to stack 2 high, but that's more efficient anyway). It's heavy, but not more than most juicers, and it gives you the leverage you need. I never move mine off the counter so I don't mind the weight. the easily removable cup rinses out in the sink so it's ready to reuse in a flash. It doesn't need a plug and it's quiet unlike electric models. You can fit a pint (lager) glass or a 2 cup cup measure under the spout. I must use it 3 to 4 times a day and i've had mine now for over 2 years. Big thumbs up from me",0

I need a few more for holiday decorations as well as gardening supplies.  Honestly, the crack and dent are not causing any problems because they cannot be seen when it was all put together.  It just annoys me that they don't take better care of the items during delivery.  The price is great and it's exactly what I wanted (and needed).

3778,"Surprisingly effective and easy. I've rented carpet cleaners.  They work OK.  When I realized that I could buy something that worked and not have to worry about the 24-hour rental period I decided to give it a try.The machine arrived in good shape.  I put it together, filled the soap and water dispensers and started to use it.  The results are at least as good as with the rental machines, and WOW is it so much easier to use.I haven't had it a long time, nor have I used it heavily so I can't offer any comments on durability.What I don't like:  The plastic hose / tool carrier on the upright portion doesn't do a good job of holding the hose, power cord and/or tools.What I do like:  The aptly named Dirt Devil does a great job.  The dirt gets sucked away.  The two dispensers for soap and water are very convenient to use.  I like the clear plastic parts so I can see what's going on.  Since I don't have to worry about return deadlines I can do parts of the house at my convenience.  The price is right.What you should know:  Buy some soap.  The bottle that comes with it will get you started but not much more.Bottom line:If you have a closet or basement to store it and especially if you've rented a carpet cleaner more than twice, I can highly recommend a system like this.  I haven't compared this brand / model with others but I've had a great experience with this one",0

This crate is easy to take up and down.  When visiting relatives, it is very easy to pack up and take with us.  With soft sides, I frequently find the puppy leaning against the sides as he is sleeping.  The ""walls"" on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate.  I bought the small, which gives him plenty of room to move around.

I dont have to worry about more cords being plugged in on my counter. Its small and opens up my cans wonderfully. I can get it started and walk off to do something really quick and it shuts off automatically when the can is opened. It walks right around my can while it sits on my counter so dont have to worry about standing there and holding the can waiting for it to be finished. I use my opener everday and have only had to plug it in once to recharge its battery and the lenght to recharge the battery was only about 2 hours. Its a very good product and well worth the price. Im sure it wont let it down.,0
3799,Good Buy. I love this banana/fruit holder :) It looks tiny on the picture but it is really good size. It is chrome finish and very elegant. Good price too,0
3800,"Funny gift to give :). It's soft and medium-sized.  Didn't pay too much for them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over and ask if they could take one. Now I don't have any left, but they're an interseting little soft ""stuffed animal"" kind of thing.  No real practical purpose probably - and I heard it's a horror if it ever opens/spills its contents.  And it's kind of funny - the thing itself is soft - but it comes in a huge box with TONS of air pillows (when you order it from amazon at least).  So if you're moving and need packing material, then here's a 2-for-1 special.",0
3801,"TITLE should read 20-Piece Set. We ordered the 16 piece set hoping to receive service for four, with 3 pieces and 4 serving pieces, just like the one shown in blue. Instead we received the 20 piece set which includes service for 4, with the 5 pieces pictured, I called customer service told them that we did not receive the four serving pieces that we expected; they said the computers were down, could you call back later? instead I emailed customer service told them that we were missing the 4 serving pieces as well as the problem I had with calling customer service.Customer service sent out another 16 piece set, (as stated on the shipping slip) but, we do not have the heart to tell them, again, that they sent out another 20 piece dinnerware set. UPDATED 1/27/0",0
3802,Tea Rose Oval Vegetable Bowl. This bowl is absolutely beautiful.  I also like the size of the bowl and the beautiful tea rose pattern.  I highly recommend it,0
3803,"Agree that smaller would be better. I have 4 cats and find that if I fill this more than halfway the water gets discolored before it's time to refill.  My cats like to play in it getting scum and food in the water so it needs to be cleaned at least once a week.  It's a great product, and I don't mind filling it halfway, however it would have probably made more sense to get the smaller one.  I would also suggest that the food and water are kept a good distance from each other to help keep the water clean.  It is not fun to clean it while it's still full.  As for the 'gurgleing' it is not a major problem with cat's since they don't drink as much as dogs it rarely happens while they are standing there.  When it does they either run off and come back later or they try to play with it.",0
3804,"Better than the new-fangled things. I've been using NeckBones for more than 10 years, always buying a spare in case my old one wears out.  My local store no longer carries them, so I decided to look on-line.  I was given one of those new, squishy pillows as a gift, and I tried it, but there's no comparison.  I use my NeckBone for traveling and sleeping due to a neck problem, and I would never go anywhere without it",0
3805,"Do-it-yourself... Love it!  Bought it for my 3-year old who is in the ""I want to do it myself"" stage.  Put her two favorite cereals in the dispenser and now she can get a bowl, fill it with cereal and grab a spoon all by herself in the morning.  She still has to wait until Mommy pours the milk - but we're working on that!",0
3806,"Excellent relatively low tech & cheap way to do CO2. This product works well, producing CO2 relatively easily and cheaply - compared to having a pressurized CO2 canister and regulator (etc.) high-tech set-up.  Be sure to educate yourself about CO2 in fish tanks.  It's good for plants, but too much could be bad for fish.  For example, I operate an airstone when lights are out at night only.  This diffuses the CO2, which is not needed by plants in the dark, and plants are not producing oxygen in the dark.  (Put air pump and airstone on a timer.)  You need to learn the basics of CO2 injection, even for this simple system.  If you do, you will have no problems, only great plants.I have only small fish (under 3 inches) in my 55 gal planted tank.  Not one fish has ever suffered as a result of CO-2 fertilization, but the plants grow much, much better!I see no reason why a DIY yeast+baking powder solution would not work -- will be going to this.  For the price, you get all you need to get started, to make your plants look great!",0
3807,"Excellent!  Lives up to its name. I was looking for a more conveniently disposable litter since I live on the top floor of my apartment building and making a trip to the dumpster every day to dispose of his duty was very annoying.  I looked into automatic cat boxes and litter lockers, but they were too bulky and expensive.  When I discovered WBCL at the pet store, I was skeptical of its effectiveness since it's all-natural.  It was nothing but great!  I put my cat on it cold-turkey and he had no problem with it.  It clumps well and truly is flushable, I've had no problems.  The odor control is good as long as you scoop regularly, which you have no excuse not to do.  All litters track, but a tracking pad will take care of that.  I feel so much better that it's environmentally friendly and healthier for my cat and myself.  Highly recommended!!!",0
3808,"This is a great knife!. I bought this knife after it was recommended in the book Kitchen Confidential. The knife is razor sharp, well balanced and it's very comfortable in the hand. Also, I accidently nicked myself with it -- I was shocked both by my own stupidity and how flawlessly the cut healed because the knife was so sharp",0
3809,"Sensational Soap Pump!. While searching for the perfect kitchen soap dispenser on Amazon, I came across two which looked identical at first. In reading the reviews of both I noticed a huge difference in customer satisfaction. Looking closer at the photos of each there was a slight difference between the two. DON'T BE FOOLED! The Progressive International Soap Dispenser is the best! Beautiful AND durable. My husband hasn't broken it yet...AMAZING",0
3810,Pop-Up hamper. This hamper can easily hold a week's worth of clothing and bedding for two people.  The casters makes it easy to roll to the laundry room.,0
3811,"Nice Alternative to Aerosol Sprays. I like my Misto very much and cook with it frequently.  From spraying the bottom of a pan for stir-fry or misting a salad, it works perfectly everytime.Make sure you read the directions, though.  I didn't and filled mine to the top and found that it would spray for two or three seconds and then squirt in a stream.  The box said it should mist for 15 seconds, so I went back to the directions to see what I'd done wrong and sure enough, you're only supposed to fill it halfway so that there's enough room for pressure to build.If you cook with oil frequently and want a healthy alternative to those off-the-shelf cooking sprays, this is the way to go",0
3812,"Works Great. I bought this to replace an earlier version that had just plain worn out.  This new model is much improved.  Nice size, sturdy plastic and it does well at trapping the grounds.  Good product if you are looking for a travelling coffee press",0
3813,"A Lot of Fun - for a Short While. This was a lot of fun. Its big and different from my Golden's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound, not a squeak but a honk, if you will.The problem came when my Golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker. This is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog's short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan.",0
3814,Unbreakable and well made. This coffee press is light weight and easy to use.  It cleans up easily and takes up little space in the cupboard.  It works as well as the more expensive ones and it won't break if it gets dropped in the sink,0
3815,"Love this vacuum. This is a great vacuum. I bought my first windtunnel several years ago and just recently needed to replace it. The vacuum is still going strong but I've run over the cord a few too many times and the cord is starting to fray. Aside from that I'm sure it would be good for a few more years. Anyway I liked my windtunnel so much that after shopping around I decided to replace it with the exact same vacuum. It's powerful and reliable. The only negative I can think of is that the hose is a little short, the vacuum will tip over if you stretch it too far",0
3816,"How to make the perfect cup of Cuban coffee. I have used this model of Bialetti 3-cup coffee maker for years; this is the exact model my Dad used when he showed me how to make Cuban coffee.  Cuban-style coffee is very similar to Italian espresso (both are made from finely-ground espresso beans) but is sweeter and stronger.  The manufacturer includes an instruction booklet but if you've never made coffee before it could be a little confusing at first.  Buy yourself a stainless steel creamer and a set of espresso cups.  Add four heaping teaspoons of sugar to the creamer.  Follow the instructions in the booklet to make the coffee.  When the coffee finishes brewing, add two teaspoons of coffee to the creamer.  Stir the coffee and sugar together until it forms a consistency similar to mousse (it will be dark at first but will lighten as you mix it).  Now add the rest of your coffee to the creamer and stir until all the sugar dissolves.  Pour immediately into the cups and serve (you should have enough to fill two cups).  The coffee will form a nice, thick head on it just like a pint of Guinness.  Enjoy!",0
3817,"Excellent...and very attractive!. First, this is more accurately called a sauce POT rather than a saucepan--it's about 8.5 inches at the bottom and gradually flares to 10 inches at the top; it's 5 inches tall (w/o cover); and it has two loop handles, which are easy to grasp. The pot is not too heavy, but it heats very evenly, and the nonstick works well and looks perfect after 6 months of heavy use (I don't use metal utensils). The curved bottom makes stirring and scraping easier, and I find the domed glass cover helpful. Clean-up is a cinch--I do handwash.  I've found this pot to be very versatile--for sauces, risotto, chili, rice, pastas, soups, stews (start on the stovetop and finish in the oven), and even smaller batches of stock (because you can fill it almost to the top). Last but not least, this pot is nicely compact for its capacity, and is attractive enough to put on the table--nice, sleek lines!  I recommend this without reservation",0
3818,If you follow the directions this is an excelent roaster. Cooks quickly and evenly.  Not as good at being a slow cooker as my slow cooker but it is wonderful as it was intended,0
3819,"17 inch model good for small cats. My Burmese kitten loves her little black Petmate Burrow Bed - it's relatively ""flat"" and hooded, so she can stretch out of the opening, or curl up against the hooded area as she pleases.  At first I was a little concerned about the construction of the bed, because when she would cuddle into a corner of the bed, the bed would ""tilt"" and leave her in a bizarre angle (as the mattress area is fluffy and round)!  But the more she sleeps on it, the more the padding compresses down, and now this is no longer a problem.  Furthermore - the entire lining (hood and cushion cover) is removable and washable.  Very nicely constructed, and highly recommended",0
3820,"For Agressive Chewers. Still the best item out there for agressive chewers.  That doesn't mean your dog won't eventually manage to get it ripped apart, but it does take longer than anything else out there.  Much better than the Orca toys which only take minutes to destroy",0
3821,"I don't want to get out of bed!. I love this duvet cover.  I didn't think my down comforter could be any more comfortable, and I bought the cover simply to keep it clean.  I didn't realize that it could make my bed so much more comfortable!  It is very soft and a great addition",0
3822,"Beautiful Hamper. This hamper is beautiful, with lively colors.  It also has a fairly large capacity.  However, it is not extremely sturdy.  I wouldn't move it with the clothes in it or put it in a room with a child who is hard on her possessions.  That said, it is a great addition to my 2 1/2 year old's butterfly themed room, and she loves the antenna, wings and face on the hamper",0
3823,Great Buy. Love the table.  Arrived in excellant condition and I put together in 1 hour.  I have had a lot of experience in assembly of this type of DIY furniture though. The hardware kit comes with 1 extra piece of key hardware just in case.  Nice touch,0
3824,"excellent product, highly recommend. I absolutely love these potholders!!!! I have four sets of them. They are great as potholders but they also have other uses. I place them under cutting boards to keep them from sliding on the counter when I am chopping. I also use them to keep bowls firmly on the counter if I am whipping cream. I also use them as trivets when placing hot pans on my counter top.My only caution regarding this product is that you need to be aware of the location of the hole in one corner of the potholder. I didn't pay attention one day and got a nasty burn pulling a very hot pan out of the oven. If you are a bit of a klutz, like me, best to keep 100% aloe in the house just in case you do what I did. Repeated applications of aloe took the burn out of the fingertip in a few hours. I was very fortunate. I hope this doesn't happen to you.I highly recommend this product",0
3825,"The Best Soup Mug. I love this mug. It is the absolute best. I searched all over for a mug that would hold my soup (one can of Campbell's Chunky), has a handle, is understated and elegant, and has a lid to prevent splatter and spills. This is a great mug",0
3826,"a very good garlic keeper. This was even nicer than I had expected, about 3 inches high at the shoulder and 4 inches across, it is big enough to hold six full heads of garlic.  It came through the dishwasher okay and is more pleasant to look at than a clay keeper",0
3827,Great Chair!. This chair is very comfotable and attractive. I'm happy with it. The price is awsome,0
3828,Kudo's to Oster's Engineers!!. This is the best blender I have ever owned! They have done away with the awful rubber gear and replaced it with a much more stable metal connection. Plus it has several handy attachments. GOOD JOB OSTER!!,0
3829,"Best Cat Litter. This litter is the best. It absorbs odors, lasts longer than regular brands and my cats love it!!",0
3830,Excellent Fan. We purchased this fan during the heat wave this past summer and it was a great buy.  Not only was it priced well but it has been an excellent fan for our small home expecially during the warm nights.  We love the fact that it has an automatic shut off feature and also an exhaust for when you need to reverse the air flow. This fan helped to cut our air conditioning bills significantly and even our friend asked me to orderd her one too,0
3831,Toasty turkey!. We bought this to use this Thanksgiving for our 20 lb turkey...but couldn't wait.  We have used several times to raost chicken and it is great.  The chicken cooked faster than our cookbooks had suggested and it cooked very evenly.  Clean up was nice too...just a little hot soapy water was enough to remove the cooked on drippings.  We did a lot of comparison pricing before we purchased this item...the price was right in line with many of the cheaper and no name brands that I had seen on sale,0
3832,An excellent product!. At less then $5 I have never seen a product that performed better! I cooked two eggs in my 600w microwave on 50% power for 4 minutes. (The instructions didn't have a chart for a 600w microwave so I did a little experimenting). I would have given the item five stars but the eggs did stick a little (the instructions said they wouldn't) but it was very minor stickage. Nothing a paper towl and some hot water wouldn't fix. Buy this product! I'm going to get me another one (or two),0
3833,"Just lovely... The flowers not only arrived in good time, they were also so lovely.  My friend, who loves roses, was very impressed.  Definitely a great purchase",0
3834,"going back for more. As the spokesperson from the kitchen of a family of five(which includes boys and their friends that use flatware to fix paintball guns, play extreme outdoor games, and use spoons to open locked doors, etc.), I have to say this has been great tableware for us.  No dings, dents, or rust.  I've had this set for over four years, and it still looks great.  It's time to fill in lost pieces that are somewhere out in the yard . .",0
3835,Nice soft towels. These towels are soft and maintain the same color after several washes.  Will buy them agai,0
3836,"Helpful for Arthritis. These treats have been great for our large-breed, older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips. They're also one of the few Glucosamine treats that don't make him sick",0
3837,"Finally, nice soft butter!!!. I have been using this butter keeper for 3 months now and it is definitely one of my favorite kitchen products!!! I hate rock hard butter so I love the fact that I can have nice spreadable butter any time I want. Furthermore, I can modulate the softness of my butter by placing the keeper in different parts of my kitchen (by the somewhat drafty, cold window for firmer butter or on the counter for softer butter). I have not had any problems with it and I am going to be ordering another one for my mother",0
3838,"Great toy for hyper kitties!. If your cat wakes you up in the morning not just to eat but to play, this toy will help!  I have four cats and they all love it.  The only negative factor is that they wear the battery out fast!  The carpeting at the base can also be used as a scratching mat.  This toy doesn't weigh that much but it doesn't topple easy.",0
3839,"Such a cute kitchen gadget!. I have to admit from the beginning that I am a sucker for cute kitchen items.  Wedgey definitely fits into that category, although it works great as an egg slicer as well.  It makes a nice gift, too",0
3840,"Delicate but very nice. We have had these glasses for a while now and are very pleased with them. True they are very delicate but they are made from borosilicate glass which is quite sturdy. We clean them in the dishwasher and have not had any problems with that, although you should make sure they don't touch other glass or metal in the dishwasher. These wine glasses have quickly become our favourites",0
3841,"Beautiful BIA !. BIA makes many dishes and bakeware items.  I have this oval baker as well as several others in this collection.  It is simple in design yet has flair about it - the gentle waves around the tops of the ""cordon bleu wavy"" collection make it a beautiful piece to go from oven to table.  The handles make it easy to transfer from countertop to oven to table.  It has a nice weight to it, bakes evenly and cleans up nicely.  I wish there were more pieces to this collection. An elegant piece to bake in and set on the table.",0
3842,"Hamilton Beach 04163. Amazon asked me to review the replacement filter so I thought I'd go ahead and make some comments about the Air Cleaner itself.  Prior to buying the air cleaner (must have been almost 3 years ago) I'd wake up most mornings with a runny nose.  Since running this overnight for the past 3 years I very rarely ever have any stuffiness or runniness in the mornings.  In fact, if someone shuts it off during the night my wife and I both notice the difference in the air in the house. I recommend this any time someone tells me about their allergies - it is one of the highest value purchases I have made - eve",0

3844,"Nothing more solid than a Bunn. I've seen other Bunn brewers run years under constant use and never wink out. If you are looking for a constant use brewer, especially for an office setting, this is it. Don't skimp on a cheap, plastic Braun, Krups, or Mr. Coffee. This is an investment that will take the abuse of multiple office patrons",0
3845,"Wonderful chocolate. A friend provided the fountain for a wedding reception, and was unaware that fountain chocolate was available. He had previously mixed his chocolate through trial and error, adding oil, then chocolate, then more oil.... I had read about Sephra's chocolate and liked that it was pre-blended with the right amount of oil to use in any chocolate fountain.We gave it a try and it was a hit! We went through three bags of chocolate in as many hours. The dark chocolate provided a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the fruit without being overly sweet. Being able to microwave the chocolate, pour it into the fountain and walk away was wonderful",0
3846,Great Everyday China. I got married last year and registered for this set. It is inexpensive and can work for everyday meals or if you have company. If you are looking for a flexible set on a budget this is it.,0
3847,"Highly recommended. As mentioned by other reviewers, the reviewer who stated that this isn't cast iron is mistaken.  This is a traditional, old fashioned, authentic Chinese wok.  If you want a modern stainless steel wok, don't buy this one. If you want the type of wok used in Chinese restaurants, this is it.  The deal offered by the Wok Shop is a really good one and you'll be hard pressed to find this good of a deal on an authentic wok anywhere else.  To learn more about The Wok Shop, the store selling this wok, and Tane Chan, the store's owner, you should read Gourmet Magazine's Dec. 2004 article on the shop. [...",0

3849,"Perfect all-around serving dish!. This dish is my favorite serving piece in my fiestaware! I already have it in seafoam. It is the perfect size, for Thanksgiving-size side dishes, everyday main courses, chips, rolls, or even desserts. I especially like the shape, it fits into tight spaces on the table. And, the price is right, compare and you'll see it's the best bargain in fiestaware! I bought this for my daughter who just moved out of the house, started her off with a small collection of Rose, her favorite color",0
3850,"The BEST Vacuum I Have Ever Owned. Even though I vacuumed my carpeting with my old vacuum on a regular basis, my carpets were still filthy. I just never realized it. When I first got my Eureka 5902BVZ, the dirt cup was filled with cat hair and other debris in no time! Someone else said they could make another cat out of the cat hair their vacuum picked up. With all the cat fur from my three kitties my vacuum picked up I could make a whole family of cats and have enough left over to knit a sweater. If I could knit that is. My furniture, carpeting and rugs look so much nicer. I have asthma and find that I am actually able to breathe better and not use my emergancy inhaler nearly as often as I had been. The Power Paw works very well on my furniture and throw pillows. The money I spent on this vacuum will certainly be made up by not having to buy sweeper bags all the time. Maybe I am a bit warped but, I enjoy seeing how much the vacuum has picked up when I remove the dust cup to empty it. I get a real sense of accomplishment. Because I'm disabled, I was concerned that this vacuum might be difficult to handle and am pleased to say it is easier for me to operate than my old vacuum. This is the best vacuum I've ever owned. I was so pleased with this vacuum after first using it I left it out to show off to all my friends when they came to visit. I have never before, in all my years, been excited about a vacuum cleaner let alone enjoy using one. Believe it or not, I am actually happy my old vacuum cleaner stopped working and I had to buy a new one...and the Eureka 5902BVZ was the one I chose",0
3851,"Tea-for-One. I bought this as a gift for a tea-lover, along with a few other tea-accessories. She loved it. It's got a classic look. It's not gaudily painted like something you'd find at Starbucks. It gets the job done. The semi-gloss finish gives it a sort of home-made feel which contrasts the robotic perfection of the curves. It sits comfortably in the kitchen both modern and rustic",0

3853,Timing & Quality Met Expectations. I received the item within the expected time period and in good condition,0
3854,"Cannot be happier!. I cannot say enough good things about this dehydrator.  I've used it for almost a year now, and I'm churning out jerky and fruit leather in huge batches a few times a year, and we always have healthy snacks on hand.I've added trays so I'm up to 8, and even with a full load, drying times are very quick.  Ground beef jerky sticks dry in 4 or 5 hours, jerky strips in less than that, and fruit leather takes 6 to 8 hours depending on what I'm drying and how thick I want it.I can dry 10 pounds of jerky sticks at one time, so it lasts for awhile.  I tend to make several flavors all at one time so everyone is happy.The fan is a little loud, but it's pushing a LOT of air, and it doesn't interfere with our TV watching in the living room next to the kitchen.Anyone who is serious about drying food should give this serious consideration.  Yes, it's pricier, but you can expand to a ridiculous number of trays and get the same results, so it really does amortize well when you look how much you can make at one time.Stock up on the mesh screens and leather trays when you expand the number of shelves, and you can be in jerky and leather all year long",0

This kit contains everything you need to start wok'n except the food.I seasoned it using the instructions sent to me in an email by the shop owner and what had looked like a dull, lifeless hunk of metal took on an almost sculptural look of bronze patterned metal.  It was almost a shame to cook on it, but now that I have a few meals on the surface, water beads up and rolls off and nothing sticks to the shiny surface.  I did need to take a metal file to the outside edges before seasoning, as they were quite sharp, but otherwise everything is just what I was looking for.

I have tried to make rice many times with different methods and my rice is always horrible, and after giving up I found this rice cooker and decided to give it a try. The very first time I used it, I achieved perfect rice, not just great rice but to my opinion it seems like restaurant quality every time and its very simple to make with this cooker. You don't even have to keep an eye on it, it figures out how long its going to take to cook on its own and when the rice is done it beeps and switches into the warming function. It also steams food, makes cakes, soup, and a slow cook function",0

The Dyzolv completely removed the stain.  This was not the first haiball the cat had coughed up.  Previously I used some other spot remover I had.  It didn't do as good a job as the Dyzolv. Since then the cat has coughed up more hairballs and everytime the Dyson Dyzolv removes the stain.  That is why I purchased two more bottles,0

I love the covers as the edges drop into the pot so water or soup or anything in it ever seeps over the top. The cover keeps everything locked in. You can scrub and use the most abrasive pads to clean the pot and never worry.  They don't even scratch from use. Not that anything sticks that much you just don't have to worry. I loved Farberware stockpots 40years ago and I'm still faithful.I have one 3 quart for over 25 years and there is nothing wrong with it today. They seem to last forever.

You can make up to eight pieces at a time, or you can remove one or two T's and hang only a couple of strips if you like. I remove it after two minutes and pull the bacon apart if the ends are sticking together. It can also be repositioned if the slices are not cooking uniformly. Then I return it to the oven and cook a minute or two more, depending on how many strips are on the T's and how crisp I want it to be.

This toaster has a green hue to it where my mixer is solidly yellow. I purchased the toaster, coffee maker and blender together in December and they all have a green hue to the pineapple color. Its so bad they actully clash if you put them side by side with the stand mixer. Maybe if you are buying the whole set at the same time you won't have this problem?

I also like using these bowls for quick candy or nuts dishes when guests arrive--they really are so veratile.  They stack up nicely in the cupboard.

However, my cat China, while sweet to humans, is nasty to the other four-legged inhabitants.  He began a spraying spree - I would come home after work to find as many as half a dozen spots sprayed. Since using the Feliway diffuser, in conjunction with an additional cat box in a cat-convenient location, and thorough cleaning and treating (with Feliway spray) of the sprayed areas, I can happily say that in the last 9 months I've only had one or two spraying incidents.  China, while still ornery, is overall much nicer to the other cats and 2 of 3 of the dogs.  I can tell when it's time to replace the diffuser because he becomes a demon again",0

We are also very glad that we bought it through Amazon.com.,0
3908,Attractive unit. I like unit because it doesn't look like other typical media storage units and can also function as non-media storage.  You do need to be careful when sliding the drawers out because they slide out fully and you don't want it dropped on your foot.  The drawers also need to be slid in carefully or it won't close fully.  The fiberboard sides aren't that attractive but it's not a horribly looking piece of furniture either and I'll probably paint it at some point,0

I've washed the pads and have found them to come out of the wash clean.  I really only have two complaints.  One, sometimes a little(I'm talking about drops here, definitely not a lot) of the mopping solution leaks out during the vacuum cycle.  This is not a problem for me because I plan to mop after I vacuum anyway.  The other complaint is that you need to remember to change the pad after vacuuming if you plan to mop.  Otherwise, you mop with a dirty pad.  Anyway, we love ours and are thrilled to have found it.",0

I had brought home a Bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the Amazon comments were very negative so I returned it.

3922,We love this french oven!. We were reluctant to spend the money on this french oven but it was worth every penny.  It heats up evenly and browns meat beautifully.  We use this 5qt. french oven to make great one pot meals (4 servings).  Just last night we made braised short ribs that were mouthwatering.  We often use this pan on the stove for browning or searing and then transfer the dish to the oven for further cooking.  Other times we use it for slow cooking on the stove.  Clean up with the pan is super easy.  Everything just wipes right out.  The pan is really heavy but that's what makes it cook so well.  My wife used to hate to cook (I used to be the only cooking enthusiast in the family) but she loves this french oven because all her recipes come out tasting so good,0

3925,"Why not?. --If you have tried french press before and are looking for a good one, there is no reason to look elsewhere.  I have not tried any other models but Bodum has a great reputation and it works as advertised.  I have had mine a year and never broken anything and it works great.  My understanding is that the only other real option is with a thermal carafe that keeps the coffee hot longer but you don't want this as far as I understand.  The reason is that in a french press, the coffee (if not poured right away) keeps on getting extracted as it sits there.  There should be nothing needed to keep warm if you are serving right away.--If you have not yet tried french press and this is the reason you are scanning reviews, please note that you trade off a little more time (compared to drip) for an explosion of flavor and complexity.  The oils that are filtered out in a drip machine (less so with a gold filter) are left in the coffee with french press so you get much more thickness and flavor with this method.  There is more tweaking and you need a burr grinder to do it right but that's fun if you like to play around a little.  The reason you shouldn't use a blade grinder is that there is much more variation in the size of the coffee grinds so some of the coffee will end up extracted unevenly introducing bitter flavors in coffee that should not be there.  A burr grinder needn't be expensive and I found one on Amazon for around $30 that I am happy with (Arielo).NOTE: It all boils down (pun intended) to how important coffee flavor is to you and preference.  I have tried drip coffee after french press and really can't go back-it is that big of a difference.  Please note that the freshness of coffee and quality (personally, I go with Peet's) is so important.  Please don't buy SB's and for the most part expect a ""blow me away"" coffee experience.  It is fun to try single origin coffees and taste the differences.  On the other hand, it's just coffee...",0

Perfect fit for DVDs, 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy DVD cases, like the ones New Line Cinema puts out, you can fit more. I don't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one DVD per slot. I have many oversized ones. The hardwood is great too, just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall. If you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then...it is worth it. I am almost ready to buy a third one soon",0

But great news - Amazon is now selling ""factory reconditioned"" machines for a thousand less than the original price, and I just received mine..It was immaculate, shipped in an original KitchenAid box with a new manual, an unopened and sealed DVD, and replacement seals.  The only apparent difference is that manual has the 2 year warranty crossed out - replaced with a 6 month hassle free warranty.The machine looks like it is built like a tank, and my 4 year old pro-line waffle baker is still going perfectly, so it's up to you, but I can't see the benefit of buying the full price model versus the reconditioned one.So search for ""kitchenaid factory-reconditioned frozen dessert maker"" and enjoy the opportunity while it lasts..",0

What's so great about this pot is the fact that the handle automatically opens the spout when you take it off the stove, which makes it incredibly easy to pour your cup of tea without messing with levers and whatnot. The handle never gets hot to the touch either, which is important. It has a nice whistle to it, which starts out slow and builds to a full whistle when it's ready. Overall, this exceeded my expectations and I am very satisfied.",0

I would definitely recommend it",0
3933,"All-Clad Pots are tops!. All clad pots are wonderful. The shorter pans with thick-cored bottoms make excellent jam pots as they deliver very good heat distribution. Good heat distribution is necessary for cooking full-flavored jams, preserves, or butters. Without good heat distribution you run the risk of burn spots on the pan's surface. These burn spots may/will impart an unwanted flavor to your product. If you've ever tried to disguise burned jam-- you know it's a losing battle. While some cooks may consider All-Clad pots or pan to be too expensive, I believe they are well worth the cost as you are less likely to burn your product. One good pan is worth more than six cheapies. Besides, quality equipment instills confidence and makes you feel like a seasoned chef.",0
3934,"Excellent cutlery from a respected maker. I bought this set for my wife for Christmas, mainly because I was stuck on ideas as to what to get her.  She spends a lot of time in the kitchen and she had been using an old set of Chicago Cutlery and several unbranded cheap giveaway knives for several years. None of those knives were that great or that sharp and I hated trying to put an edge on them even though I'm pretty good at sharpening knives.Essentially, knives are just sharpened pieces of steel that appear to be pretty simple, straightforward instruments that shouldn't be difficult to produce.  But a little experience with some poor examples prove this to not be the case.  Like most seemingly simple things, the simplicity is an illusion.My experience has not been with kitchen knives but it has been with ""working"" knives.  Pocket knives and fixed blade knives designed for hard use in the nasty jobs I have to do daily from removing staples in papers at the office to chopping down woody weeds in the backyard to cutting up boxes, rope, cording and thin pieces of aluminum.  I know the value of a blade that can take a good edge and hold it through a lot of abuse.I did a little research and found several brands of kitchen knives that had universal respect.  Wusthof always was at or near the top of everyone's list.  More often than not, it was number one in the reviews and surveys I came across.My wife was a little apprehensive about the sharpness of the knives out of the box.  She quickly realized the value of a really sharp kitchen knife and, in no time, she was commenting on how much easier it was to work with the Wusthof's than the cheapo knives she had been using.  She has really been making good use of the paring knife and the chef's knife in the days since Christmas. My own limited use of the chef's knife from this set confirms how well it handles and cuts compared to the clunky Chicago Cutlery chef's knife.After looking over more reviews, I've ordered the Wusthof 7"" hollow edge santoku to go with this set.  Designed for thin cuts, it will fit in well with the other knives.  I'll probably also get a serrated edge bread knife in the not-too-distant future to round out the Wusthof set.  This is likely to be a lifetime purchase for our household and that makes the high price more of an investment.  I'm well pleased and so is my wife.",0

3940,Fun soup bowls save my lunch when the phone rings. These bowls are ideal for spaghetti or soup and so many things. I like the wide lip that helps prevent spilling and drippng. I also appreciate being able to reheat in the microwave. So often when I am having a nice bowl of soup on a cold day the phone rings and my meal gets cold. I don't like having to pour it out of the dish and reheat it then pour it back. Now I just pop it in the microwave and I'm back on track with lunch. I chose the periwinkle color but think I should try other colors too. They are fun to have around and easy to clean afterwards in the dishwasher,0
3941,"Seems to work great!. My cat has always been high strung and just plain mean.  She growled, hissed, slapped, bit - you name it.  So when someone recommended Feliway to calm her down, I decided to try it, but I didn't hold out much hope.  I plugged it in in the master bedroom - her domain and saw an immediate difference.  Oh, she still growls sometimes, but she is much more loving and affectionate and seems calmer.  Great product!!",0
3942,"Not like an outdoor grill, but quick & easy.  We like it !. Very easy to use and easy to clean, especially if I remember to spray the grill (as recommended) before preheating.  I usually just  soaked the grills briefly in hot, soapy water and they cleaned easily. They will go in the dishwasher, but I prefer to do them by hand since it's so simple.  I found that I do need to clean the edges of the ""cut out"" oval where the grease runs into the drip pan, which I was not expecting.  But, still easy enough.  The hamburgers, turkey burgers and chicken breasts were cooked quickly and were very good, even though not the same as on an outdoor grill.  For turkey burgers & chicken, a sprinkle of paprika improves the color of the finished dish. I also plan to cook a few extra burgers next time for a quick reheat in the microwave with no clean up",0
3943,"Great 'upgrade' from a mop. Having a whole house (1600 sq ft) of tiled floor with area rugs we spent a lot of time mopping.  This little cleaner makes it so much easier and cleans so much better!  The first time it was kind of eye-opening seeing the improvement in appearance of the tile and the dirt on the head covers used. It pulls easily and has a fairly long electrical cord.Be sure to get additional terry cloth covers for the head if you have a large area to cleans or have kids and pets running across your floors.  Or it is easy to make head covers from old towels cut to the same size.The only problem we have had is the button you push to get continuous steam seems to pop out too easily, making it necessary to keep your finger on the switch to keep the steam coming.",0

3945,"Best Buy for Every Day  Wine Use. I was impressed by this new arrival because of the Brand name ""Reidel"" and was looking for a glasss for ""drop in"" guests and summer cookouts and these four glasses fit the bill perfectly! This way if I break one on my tile floor I won't ""burst into tears"" at the loss knowing I got a great deal on Amazon. Com and if ""someone"" breaks one, I'll order another 4 for backup! These will be great for lunches, packing in a picnic basket for summer outings and simple but nice for casual entertaining",0
3946,"Great Quality and Value. I bought the first set because they seemed well priced compared to the terrycloth style we usually use. They are of high quality, good color and do hold their shape. I have to remember not to use a dryer sheet so they have increased absorbtion rate. Very pleased.",0
3947,"Salton Tea Maker. This tea maker makes delicous tea. The unit is light-weight and the price was great. Our only complaint with it is the security of the basket (filter/teabag holder). Even though I lock it as it says, if I don't position the pitcher just right under the basket where the spring is, the basket can fill with tea and overflow. I usually have to check it and move it as necessary and even re-lock the basket to prevent this from happening.",0

3949,Great addition to my collection. I just got this lovely lasagna baker FREE by buying another 4 place settings to add to the 12 I already own in the Gold Dust Green pattern.I was really happy to find it and several other companion pieces here at amazon because I have had trouble finding them in the regular stores.The pan is very large but not bulky or overly heavy. The Gold Dust Green finish is beautiful on this piece and it will look really great on the table with my other pieces. A company size Lasagna will fit in this pan and I also think I could squeeze a couple of chickens in it.The pan and the set of dishes were packed very carefully and I had no breakage whatsoever,0
3950,"Wonderful product!. I have 3 cats and have owned the other brand named pet fountain with the filtration system. I gave up on it after the constant cleanings, and the cat hair in the water and filter. The motor burned out I think because the water level was low.The bubbler took my cats getting used to. It makes more noise than the prior fountain but after 3 days they have adapted and enjoy it. One cat sleeps right next to it. I think he enjoys the sound of it (like a brook running water). I highly recommend this product. It was easy to set up, the water tank needs filling about once per week, and it's easy to clean",0
3951,"Good blades, nice feel. I was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price.  I was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion.  This set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand.Although this set comes with a sharpener, I recommend getting the Wsthof 2904 Knife-Life knife and scissor sharpener.  You will not need to sharpen these knives much, but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house.I also recommend, as others have, to never place these knives in the dishwasher.  Also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use.  This will drastically increase their longevity.If you purchase these, and I propose you do so, then get a travel roll bag for knives.  This is because you will want to take them to friends' and family's homes to ""show them off""",0

3953,"Hours of Enjoyment. This toy has provided countless hours of enjoyment for our dog.  We have a 65lb labrador greyhound mix.  She eats most toys and is not fond of kongs once the stuffing is out (but she is not able to eat the kongs beyond the soft puppy one).  This toy is great because the hole is small, yet there are little prongs you can cut to make the toy less challenging.  I think she enjoys the noise the treats make inside the balls. Larger treats of course take her longer to get out, but stuffing it with her food works just fine most of the time.  She realyl enjoys all of the Busy Buddy products - Squirel Dude is great but the saucer got old quickly for her",0
3954,Beautiful!. I can not begin to express how pleased I am with my new tray. It arrived in perfect condition. It's both beautiful and well made. My husband's already requested breakfast-in-bed. I can't wait to serve tea to my friends and family,0
3955,"Bam!  What a pan.... I added this sauce pan to my cookware collection recently.  I was looking for stainless steel because I feel that for a saucepan this is the best option for making soups, sauces, etc.  Non-sticks just don't do it for me.  This pan looks and performs wonderfully.  It heats evenly and cooks sauces without any hot spots.  The pan has a triple bottom, aluminum, stainless steel and a small strip of copper which gives it a stylish look. The glass lid is also a nice feature because it allows you to view your food without haveing to remove the lid.  This comes in handy when you are preparing rices or any other type of dishes that require the lid be kept on at all times.  Clean up is also a breeze. The pan is made by all-clad, but does not come with their steep price.  You can't beat the value.  Emeril's cookware is top notch quality and is my favorite because it performs well and is reasonably priced",0
3956,"Hard to Clean. Le Creuset cast-iron products really conduct the heat and are great products to have in the kitchen. One drawback, they can be difficult to clean. If you sear meat or fry, burnt remnants cannot be removed. Overnight soaking will help but you cannot use soft scrub or hard scrubbers on the enamel. The product still functions well, it just does not look as nice as an expensive piece of cooking gear should be! Would buy it again",0

3958,"Does it do everything?  No, but close. Can you believe a microwave that will brown chicken?  I've cooked things in this that makes me seem like a gourmet chef, but I'm not even quite an average cook.  Chicken breast that practically melt in your mouth, but the outside has a tantalizing crispiness that's sure to please the taste buds.  Most recent to this review, I cooked several rounds of New York strip steak.  A nice steak rub, a bit of non-stick spray for the rack and turntable tray (makes for an easy cleanup), and a steak-lover's dream was created.  I do the typical hot-dog heating in the microwave...but you can't really place them directly on the metal tray if you want them to heat quickly.  They are slightly below where the microwaves really concentrate and take a few seconds longer to heat.  I place a microwave-safe plate on the turntable upside down to elevate it slightly and it works much better.  This also works for microwave popcorn.  I had trouble getting it to pop in the 3 minutes allocated to the popcorn button (large bag), it took more like 5.  Put it on the upside down plate, it pops in 2 minutes and 45 seconds (yes, I've done enough of them to remember :-)Buy this one, I doubt if you'll be sorry.  I got it originally because I was a full-timer in an RV and was looking to replace a failed microwave oven.  After owning this for about a month, I got rid of my toaster oven, my rotisserie, my jetstream oven, and I can't remember what else.  It doesn't do toast that fast, so I kept my toaster.  It is rather heavy and deep for a microwave, but it takes a lot less space than all of the other appliances it replaces",0

I was so-so about purchasing any as there was always something that I just didn't like such as the design, or the grip, shape, the set itself or even the price.  When I found this set, it all just popped.  I have given them a workout and they exceed all of the expectations I had for them.  I love the grips, the design, the price and most important, the function. It is a perfect set for the everyday cook. I highly recommend these knives",0

3971,"Chef Recommends! Great professional quality knives at a reasonable cost. Okay, so I'm not a chef, but more of a Seinfeld fan.  I am an amatuer who wanted to have a decent set of knives and I picked these out after quite a bit of searching.A real chef will tell you to get the knife that ""feels right"" to you.  Alton Brown recommends that you handle the knives before you buy, since you won't use an uncomfortable unergonomic one even if it looked awesome before you bought.These have a very solid handle riveted to a full tang of high quality steel.  The top of the blades are all thicker than many of the other brands (and even other models from the Henckels brand).  They felt good to me, they are perfectly balanced and heavy in the hand.  They feel substantial when you pick them up.They didn't seem to be as sharp as I expected from such a set of knives, but regular use of the included sharpening steel improved on my impression of this.  One detractor is that most burgeoning young chefs have never used a steel or hone and they don't include instructions in the set for this.  BAD IDEA!  I have since found instructions on the web, from Henckels themselves, even.  When I do it properly and take my time, they are simply amazing.  Leaving out instructions was bad form.  Maybe mine was missing?Dishwashers are not recommended as bouncing around can nick the blade.  I have a plastic basket and I keep planning on putting them in there to see how fare.  But I can't bring myself to do it.  Handwashing is a pain, but I know they will last that way.I'm going to chalk up the sharpness to my own unskilled hands (and I'm pretty sure that goes for many others).  Even the German made ones would get dull without proper steel use.  They are absolutely top notch quality at an amazing price.  They hold their edge very well when you use the steel.  Avoid bone and glass-surface cutting boards.  The only thing I wish is that I could toss them in the dishwasher.  But like quality stainless pans, you don't want to subject them to the heat, caustic detergent and banging.Don't hesitate to buy these knives.  Maybe you could use them to whip up some ""Clams Casino""!  Hmmm... tastes funky",0
3972,Richell one-touch adjustable gate. I really am truly satisfied  with this product.  The dimmension where it set up is different at top and bottom due to the base boards.

3974,"what a great bet-sitting pillow. I am often writing 12-18 hours some days.  I learnt long ago that sitting at a PC was killing me.  Legs often had swelling, worse I suffered bad tendinitis in my neck, elbow and wrist.  I mean painful to where I would have to stop using the PC.  Then I switched to laptops and WOW.  No more pain in my neck elbow or wrist.  But it's often a pain to keep the pillows pushed up in the proper comfort and and the one behind my neck is forever slipping.Here it the perfect solution.  I use a pillow under my knees and this wonderful creation.  It's not like the old-fashioned bed-sitting pillow, that just propped your back.  His is so comfortable.  Leaning against it is like learning on a cloud of feathers.  There is has strong arms that give you support.  But the best thing is the neck rest.  Sort of like the whiplash cushion in a car, it has a special pillow insert (it's removable) that cradles your neck.So if you watch telly in bed sitting up, or read books or use a laptop, this is worth every penny to have complete comfort!  It comes is several shades even denim to match your decor.I highly recommend this for anyone who sits in bed",0
3975,Sango Nova Blue Ceramic Spoon Rest. Great!  I love it!!  Goes great with my kitchen,0
3976,"Excellent Specialty Knife. When I began collecting Wsthof-Trident Classic knives twenty years ago, I chose the basics first: cook's knives, parers, slicers, utility knives, steak knives, boning &amp; filet knives. I acquired them one or two at a time, always on sale, because this cutlery has been an expensive investment. When Wsthof added a tomato knife to this line, I bought it even though I wasn't sure if I would like it or use it a lot. Now I recommend this 5-inch tomato knife to everyone. Its serrated edge hasn't needed sharpening ever, and it cuts, slices, dices, and chops fresh tomatoes so quickly. The forked tip is great for taking out the stem ends of tomatoes. I've never used my tomato knife on anything other than tomatoes, which is why I think it has stayed so sharp. I use my 8-inch serrated bread knife for slicing bagels and breads, and my 5-inch serrated utility knife for cutting citrus and other fruit. Also, I hand-wash and dry this knife and keep it stored in a wooden block",0
3977,"Great Little Heater. I bought this heater to put it under my desk at work. Heats really well, and worths the money. The only problem that I have observed is that it starts working really silent but after sometime it gets a little bit noisier but that's all bad about it. It cools down pretty fast too.",0
3978,"Luxury features I never expected for this price, never. Power-level settings of 100%, 90%, and right on down--I am amazed. I think the very-low settings are for drying food; can you imagine being able to do dried foods yourself? Then quick-buttons for nearly everything. It'll take a while to learn all the features but even right out of the box it was just so easy to use! All I wanted was a small simple one that wouldn't take much counterspace and never dreamed it would have all this, not for this price. My old microwave had just given out--after 23 years of daily use--and the one thing I wanted was defrost, that's all. I'd always used the microwave, on defrost, to simmer foods that needs long, slow cooking--with no pot-watching and no chance of burning. You ought to try that! Much better than on the stove--and this does have defrost, of course of course--but so many other settings that will be even better for slow cooking. Then you can choose to defrost meat according to how much the chunk of meat actually weighs, of all things--there's a setting for that too! Never heard of that! One more feature I especially wanted was for the light to go out when the door is open and here's why: The way to make a microwave last simply forever is to leave the door open a while after each use and let it dry out. Then it will last for decades--like my old one did. But wouldn't want to leave it open if the light stayed on, no; so another highly desirable feature right there. I just don't think a better microwave could be bought at any price, period--many more features aren't even listed here. The more expensive ones seem to only have features I'd never use anyway--a built-in toaster or something--so why pay for that! No, if it's microwaving you're after, this is just IT. Also, if you're wondering about size, it says compact but holds a regular-size Pyrex loaf pan with room to spare as it turns, or a big mixing bowl with a pretty big hen or whatever in it, so that's plenty big for most people.  It's the design--there are scooped-out places in the inner walls that allow space for the rim of a bowl or a pan to turn. That's why it holds so much. And hey, it looks nice too--and is light enough that I can easily move it to clean under it yet it does feel as heavy and solid as can be.  My hat is certainly off to the designers! (And as always, to Amazon! It got here in no time with Amazon's free SuperSaver shipping--days before I was told it would arrive!) I don't have a single negative to say after a week's use and every day am still discovering yet more wonderful things about it that save a busy person's time and energy--as well as money. Thought I'd let other shoppers know",0

3980,"Better than Expected performance with this Table Cloth. At the last minute before Thanksgiving 06, My Mom decided she had to have a brand new Table cloth.  She ordered two from one of those junk mail catalog that arrive monthly.  Those cloths came in and were the wrong sizes.  She returned those cloths and I went online to hunt down a replacement.  I stumbled upon the Reflections 70 Inch Round Tablecloth.  We had a tough time choosing a color!  We settled on the Stone Blue.  We placed the order but when it came down to selecting shipping, we didn't want to pay for overnight service.  We know it would not be here if we did regular shipping but we took our chances.  Here's what happened, I placed the order late and the Table cloth should have been processed the next day.  For some reason it was processed that same day.  Amazon got this cloth to us within 3 days (not the 7 to 10 days they told us it would take).  Amazon did an outstanding thing by getting this item out and shipped to us so it was in our hands so we didn't have to worry about what we were going to do about a TableCloth.  Thanksgiving day were put this beautiful blue table cloth on our table for thankgiving dinner.  Mom was to happy that we found suck a nice cloth that did not cost an arm and a leg.  She was very happy she didn't have to spend a ton of money getting it here.   Our Thanksgiving Dinner was terrific!!  Nothing stained or damaged this cloth!

3981,"lupine collars are the best we've found!. This collar is bright and pretty, but more importantly, it is strong.A year ago I had my dog break out of a similar collar by another manufacturer. She suddenly pulled on her leash to chase a squirrel, the plastic latch released, and she was off in a busy city street. It was a frightening experience that made me realize that I needed to find a stronger collar.The lupine collar we got her is the strongest I've found, and the lifetime guarantee lets me know that they are confident that the collar won't deteriorate. This collar is cute, lightweight, and very safe. I highly recommend it.",0

First off, delivery was very quick, and assembly was very easy. Second, all the pre-drilled holes did line up.

3985,"A Great Saut Pan for Those Large Portions. I got my 6 quart All Clad Stainless saut pan about a month ago and I've been using it frequently.  I cook large batches of meatballs with it and I'm impressed with how the meat does not stick, how well the meat browns, and how well the pan reaches temperature and returns to temperature, even as I place all the meatballs at once instead of in batches like with my old Calphalon 5 quart saut pan.My only suggestion to All Clad to improve this pan is to replace the long handle (the handle they use with the stainless line) with the longer handle they use with their Copper Core line (when the pan is 6 quarts).  I notice that it is easier to handle my heavier Copper Core pieces than my stainless and LTD pieces when the pan is full.  And the longer handle should also make it easier to remove the pan from the cache rack when the lid is stored through the handle.  All Clad should also think about putting the longer handle on the larger pieces.This pan is a keeper",0

3987,"After two weeks, I'm learning to roast coffee with I-Roast 2. After a few hours on the Internet reading reviews and learning about roasting, I purchased the I-Roast 2.  I've done at least 15 batches so far.  The machine is functioning fine, but I'm learning something with each new batch.  I'll tell you my impressions so far.1.  The machine is attractive and quite easy to learn how to use.2.  It is a bit noisy, but I knew that before I bought it.3.  It has a round wire ring above it which makes it quite easy to vent off any smoke.  I got a metal 90 degree ""elbow"" made for clothes dryers and vent right out a window by attaching this elbow to the top of the machine.4.  I've learned the key to roasting is watching the beans while roasting.  Look for the color you want.  This machine is glass-sided, so it's easy to see the beans.  If you can't monitor the color, each batch would be a guess at the product.  You'll learn which color beans you like the most.5.  There's a button you push to see the roasting temp at any given time.  It seemed to read low for what I had set.  I've since read on the Net that this machine's inner temps might be hotter than the number reads.  It's not too important if you're getting the roast you like, but you have to watch it and guage results.6.  Cleaning the chaf afterwords only takes a few seconds.  It's really easy and no work at all.7.  As I get the roasts I like, the programable option is really nice.  I can repeat it later if I want to.8.  The I-Roast 2 cooling cycle is automatic and easy.  From what I've read, this is really important.  After this 4 minutes cycle, the beans are almost room temperature and easy to remove from the glass drum.  I put the beans into an open glass container for breathing for a day before grinding.9.  Overall performance is great.  I can't comment on long term durability, but so far I'm really pleased.  I'd recommend this machine to others.W.B",0

3992,"hey, they work!. I was alittle skeptical buying these.  But they seem to be working great",0
3993,"great. love it! rechargeable, seems to last better than battery operated ones. The design has improved too. I have had two of them. I love how you can dismantle this one so it won't break if packed away.makes good froth too.",0
3994,"Decent set for the right price. This set of knives is beautifull. They are sturdy and very well made. The price is well worth the product and I think it's a great value for the money. Let's face it most of the time you get what you pay for, These on the other hand defy that logic not by alot but defy it none the less. I would encourage anyone looking for a decent set of steak knives and arent willing to pay the big $$$, to pick these up. You won't be dissappointed",0
3995,"Perfect for My Office Desk. I purchased this little machine to be used on my office desk.  After a week of daily work day use, I have no major complaints.  The only thing missing that would make it over the top is a thermal stainless carafe.  I have not had any problems with leaking from around the top or poor, metallic taste which might be more attributable to one's water source.  We have bottled water here, and I am quite devoted to my Starbuck's coffee. I had considered buying a permanent filter, but I find the paper ones much easier to simply toss for clean up, and they aren't that expensive.  The 30 minute automatic off can be a blessing and a curse; it keeps me from forgetting to turn the machine off, but sometimes it turns itself off before I've finished the pot, but that's not a big deal as I just hit the switch to turn it on again to fire up the heat.  A full pot makes at least 2 good mug servings for me, and that's really all I need in the morning.  I am very pleased with this machine; I use an old 4 cup Mr. Coffee machine at home which works well, but I like the more straight up, compact design of this one for my desk top",0
3996,"A most convenient appliance. This appliance is a little marvel: elegant design, barely audible, much more discrete than a ceiling fan and very efficient to recuperate the hot air trapped under our 14 feet roof",0
3997,"Analon Rocks!. I've had the eight piece set for a year and a half now, and this pan (sold without the lid) for about two years. They're all good quality, heavyweight cookware, and the non-stick works like a charm.  I've not had a single problem with sticking, and the interior remains scratch-free.I wonder if the people who complain about scratches are storing their pans stacked inside of each other.  This can lead to scratching.  One easy solution is to place a paper towel between pans when stacking.No, it's not dishwasher safe, but you really don't need to put it in the dishwasher!  It doesn't fit in my sink, either, but you don't need to soak it.  The food slides right off, and it takes less than two minutes to wash the pan.I highly recommend any of the Analon Classic cookware",0
3998,"great pillow. If you've ever been to any normal store that has pillows, you'll know that finding a body pillow that wont die in 5 seconds is hard.  I've had this for a few weeks now and it shows no signs of loosing its fluff, of which it is very fluffy, but not so much that it will smother you.  If it lasts longer than my other failed attemps, I may have to stock up",0
3999,"Great Product. I am very pleased with these sheets. They are deep fitting sheets, so they never came loose from the mattresss. I gave them a 4 of 5 because I have bought other 300-count sheets that are softer and silker than these, but they are still much better than any lower count sheet, and cheaper than what I could find at Wal-Mart. I highly recommended them.",0
4000,"Solid!. These bowls are nice. Perfect for soup, dessert, salad, or whatever. Well, I like big salads, so they're a little small for MY salads. But they're great for a lot of things, and I SWEAR you could drop them on the floor and they probably wouldn't break. They fit nicely on the small Fiestaware plates so you don't spill a full bowl of soup. They go in the fridge to store leftovers, in the dishwasher (I've washed these things hundreds of times and they're still in great shape), and probably in the freezer, too. If only Fiestaware would make tupperware-like lids so I'd feel more comfortable putting these in the freezer for storing things. As they are, I have to use plastic wrap, which always lets in yucky freezer smells",0
4001,"I love this bowl!. I love this serving bowl. I used it to store my various fruit when I was single. Now, spending my first holiday with my new husband, I am using it for casseroles, meat dishes and all sorts of uses! I highly recommend it and would buy more if my budget allowed.",0
4002,"A good value!. I purchased one of these yesterday and I am very happy with it. It moves a lot of air, and it is fairly quiet. Anything with a motor will make some noise -- it is very quiet on low speed, and as you increase the speed to super it gets a little louder. Most of the noise is not from the motor (which IS very quiet)-- it is from the moving air. AND DOES IT MOVE! This cooled off a 14x16' room better (and more quietly) than an air conditioner. It fits in your window, so it does not take up floor or counter space, AND you don't need to worry about pets or children knocking it over. I like this better than the floor fan I bought. So much so that I am returning the floor fan and getting another Honeywell window fan. There is a more expensive model with a remote, but I didn't think the extra [money] was worth it. BOTTOM LINE: A well made product from a name you trust, and a GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE",0
4003,"I Wish I'd Bought Feliway A Long Time Ago... To the Feliway product description information above, I would also add, ""Aids in calming cats...who manage stressful chronic health conditions.""My 4yr. old neutered male cat manages several chronic health conditions, which at times create seemingly unrelated behavioral issues, when flare ups occur that jangle his nerves.  When his IBD is not well controlled, my otherwise angelic cat becomes stressed out & does deadly things - chewing through power cords, consuming inedible objects, eating plants untouched for years, climbing to & jumping/falling from extremely high places aggravating his arthritis, & more.  When he's not feeling well, acting-out is his way of externalizing his bad nerves & telling me, ""I don't feel well, help me"".So I bought a Feliway Diffuser for him for his birthday a few weeks ago, & the change in my cat's behavior was noticeable within the first few hours after plugging it in.  Initially, I noticed a personality change - sort of a mellowing effect, reflecting a more leveled out & increased general sense of well-being.  I see less lethargy, & more interest in social interaction, his environment, & play.  It's a subtle overall field effect, but his happiness & joy somehow seem happier.  I've noticed I've had an easier time with giving him his regular medications & brushing his teeth.  It's a synthetic feline facial pheromone, but I call it ""the airborne feline prozac""...  And without putting more chemicals into his system that don't belong in the body, & their problematic side effects.  My cat seems to appreciate the general change in the overall atmosphere of his home, & occasionally, he even sleeps underneath the diffuser.The benefits my cat experiences also pass on to me - because if he is less stressed & upset, & doing fewer life threatening things in reaction to his nerves - then I'm less stressed out as well.  I'd rather buy him Feliway, than spend money on veterinary visits & additional medication to deal with new problems he creates when he's stressed.  And there have been a lot of them.Feliway contains an odorless oil by human standards, & it does not upset my cat's severe asthma or allergies, nor my own more moderate conditions.  In fact, I am wondering that if he's less stressed out psychologically - & in turn physiologically - if there might even be less asthma & less digestive upset due to a reduction in the cycle of internalized stress.  And if it improves his overall quality of life, I'd much rather buy him peace instead of more doctors...I live in a small 1 person unit, & 1 diffuser does seem to cover the entire place.  I unplug ours when the window is open, & plug it back in when it's closed, while I sleep or am away, & any time I think he might benefit from it.  The plastic bottle can be unscrewed from the plug-in unit & recapped to preserve it until your next use.  This may help to extend the 6 week life span recommended in the packaging information, we'll find out.  I would also add that the diffuser gets warm, but not hot to the touch, & certaintly not hot enough to burn a hand or singe a whisker or fur.  I have handled the diffuser many times during use, & I have no fear of allowing my cat to be directly near it.The only negative aspect of this product so far as I can determine is how much you'll want to kick yourself for waiting to buy it for long as you did...  As a pet store employee recently told me, ""It is one of the few behavior mod products for cats on the market that actually does work.""  While there is no substitute for building & maintaining a solid, trusting relationship with your pet - or for seeking competent veterinary care - Feliway does seem like it could be a great adjunct to it.Feliway gets 2 Thumbs & Paws Up from kitty & me.  =^..^",0
4004,"Very nice, but sorta SMALL... This is a neat little filter, and I mean LITTLE!  The cone-part hangs down 2.5"" into the cup, and is 1.75"" around at the top, tapering down to 1.5"" at the bottom.  Perfect for a nice little cup of tea; an 8oz cup of tea.  My tea drinking is done, I guess, in ""mug-size"" amounts of +20oz, so this is a bit bitty for me.  I bought a TF 500, now THAT'S more my size.  Gonna return this mini one and get another 500!!!  Great filters, you bet",0
4005,"well above 5 stars.  The best interactive toy available.   10 stars. My pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind.  He jumps to pull the beas out of the hive.  He squeaks the beas.  Perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head.  He went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it.  It is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads.  He likes the wing detail for chewing on.  This toy gives exercise.  I am so glad I tried it.  He plays with the hegehog on his own.  Those are the 2 best toys.  The squirels from the hide a squirel are fun, but the game holder is not something he was really excited about.  These interactive toys are great.  I have never seen such excitement and tail wagging.  He hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise.  This one is the best.  It is well worth $10 for a dog who loves to play.  I get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys",0
4006,"Waterproof Pad. I'm sure this waterproof pad would be exceptional for most instances.  It just couldn't handle the demands placed on it by our thirteen year old son.  Thank goodness for hospital mattresses!That said, it should be fine for most other applications.  It just wasn't made to handle the abuses this child can put things through.",0
4007,Great Slicer. I think this is a great slicer for the price. I am a cook by occupation and I bought one of these for my small restaurant.  I liked it so much I also bought one for home use. I have sliced everything from a 20lb roast beef to bread. I love it,0
4008,"in accurate picture / comfortable loveseat. two points that have me disappointed with this item are: the color of this loveseat is actually a lot darker in person than depicted in the picture.  also, i recieved this loveseat without any of the required hardware or tools to put it together.  it was left out of the package so i had to go to the hardware store and figure out and buy my own to get this thing together.  aside from those two problems, the loveseat is actually very solid and comfortable to lounge in.  i like the nice suede-like fabric",0
4009,Very elegant. This decanter brings style to the table! One star deduction for difficult to clean. The design is simple but elegant - good german quality,0

4011,"Best Decemberween present EVER!. I can't believe someone thinks these gorgeous glasses are ugly! Oh my god...I opened these and I *cried* they are so beautiful. Each glass has its own little personality, it's own pretty curve. Hold one of these and it practically talks to you. They are so incredibly big and gorgeous! Even though they are primarily designed to present each type of wine at optimum bouquet & flavor , the size and shape of the glasses also displays the color very well, too. These are the crown jewels of my glassware collection. I am incredibly happy with them",0
4012,"Incredible piece of kitchen luxury. I have oogled Le Creuset dutch ovens since I first became a fan of Ina Garten, and I was spoiled enough to receive one as an Easter gift, the 5.5 quart in black.  I love the look of this pot, and the heft.  It is a solid quality piece.  I roasted chicken in it tonight and it came out beautifully.  Technically this pot isn't nonstick but I could have wiped the pot clean with a paper towel!  It was *so* easy to clean.  I couldn't justify buying myself one pot worth two hundred dollars, but I see now that I will use this until I'm old and grey.  I can't wait to make soup in it tomorrow.  Such a fabulous investment!  If I had known about them when I got married I would have registered for one (and a KitchenAid Artisan mixmaster too - but that's another story :) )!  Don't make the same mistake I did",0
4013,A pillow for pregnant women. I bought this pillow for one reason...headaches. I recently became pregnant with my second child and was advised to sleep on my left side.Which would be perfectly fine except Im a belly sleeper and have the flat pillow that goes with it.I literally had the same headache for 2 weeks after I began sleeping on my side. I chose this pillow because my also pregnant sister recommended it. After using it for afew months it works great. No more headaches (from  my neck anyway). The reason I give it only 4 stars is for two reasons...IT IS HEAVY...you cant grab it off the bed to lay on the couch when your sick or prop it behind your back to read in bed. After our baby comes and Im well healed (and back to sleeping on my stomach) Ill probably pass this on to my husband (who is even now trying to steal it)and get a water pillow so I can have a little flatter pillow(this one is nice and thick,0
4014,"Great organizing tool. I got this out of frustration of trying to find places to charge all of our gadgets. We had cords and gadgets everywhere! (Two PDAs, two cell phones, an ipod, and a bluetooth earpiece.)This item has helped us get organized tremedously.Pros: Nice sturdy wood and velvet trim. Has a door in the back with holes on each end for you to choose which side you want the power strip cord to come out. Two extra slots in the door allow for cords to come through as well. Also comes with two plug extenders that allow you to plug in those chunky transformer-type chargers.Cons: Almost all of my chargers have those chunky transformer-type chargers, so I have to plug one charger into a regular outlet and run the cord through the slots. I could have used probably 3 more of those plug extenders b/c the transformers cover up the plugs on the power strip. Maybe you can find some at an electronic store to solve this problem.It is also a little cumbersome to set up, but in the long run it pays off to have everything hidden and organized.I would highly recommend this product",0
4015,very satisfied. This is a replacement for the same model I had before. I've had the old one for about 5 years and the only problem I had was the cord coming out of the machine loosened up and my husband had to fix it.I totally recommend this,0
4016,"A nice set - lids are fairly tight and they're nice and heavy. I liked them alot and I think they're good for the sale price I paid ($90).  The lids were very tight-fitting, which was a suprise.  It was almost too tight on the 8"" pan, but it does work out okay.  The handles are definitely plastic, so if you're looking for a nice rubber handle, this isn't for you.  Overall, a quality set for a pretty good price - this set isn't for experienced chefs, however",0
4017,It works!. Perfect light for a night-time light.  The light covers the entire room but is not so bright that it over-powers your night-time eyes,0
4018,Best Alarm I Ever Had. I don't know what the person with the one star was talking about but was so wrong. This alarm is very loud.  Not only is it loud when it goes off but the light flashes on the one that is going off.  I am actually gonna order another one. Best one I had ever since I already had tried several!  Its a must to get,0

4021,"Loved by cat, very quiet, easy to refill. This is the first fountain I'd bought, but our 17 year-old cat kept making a mess in the old water dish by pawing at the water with her front paws.  While this was cute, it made a mess.Got the fountain, she immediately abandoned the old water dish and now drinks much more water (good!) and doesn't splash in the water at all, just drinks right where the water flows out.She loves it so much - yelling and following me around the whole time I refill or clean it until it is back.The reservoir can be removed with water still in it without spilling water.Yeah, you might spill a little when putting it back, but it is okay with me.It is pricey, but highly recommended if you really love your cat!",0
4022,"very handy - I want TWO sets. These canisters are great.  I intend to buy a second set.  They keep food fresh, convenient, and much tidier than the packages you buy it in.  The lids are secure and easy to use, and they stack well.  I also like the fact that they're opaque because I use the smallest one for coffee, which keeps better if stored away from light",0

4026,"Missing Link Plus. My breeder recommended Missing Link many years ago for my dogs, who were fairly young at the time, and I began using it.  My dogs' coats were always healthy and shiny with Missing Link.  As they got older, and had signs of arthritis, I changed to Missing Link Plus with glucosamine.  It was a big help in maintaining reasonable mobility as they aged.  My oldest Belgian died two years ago at age 15+; my remaining one will be 12 soon.  While the old dogs are slower and stiffer, they get around pretty well with the help of Missing Link  Plus with glucosamine.  We just got an active two year old, and she gets Missing Link Plus, too.  I have bought it in one pound bags when I have had only one dog, but when I am giving it to two or more I get the 5 pound bag for cost savings.  I will put it in a one pound bag, and freeze or refrigerate the rest until needed",0
4027,"Great bowls. These bowls have been in my home for a few years now.  We have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave.  They are nice looking and very functional.  When we needed another bowl when one broke, we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl",0
4028,"I bought two more after liking the first so well. I've read the various reviews.  I can't comment on the experience of other people, but here's mine.  I have a bathroom that can be quite chilly, and I thought I'd see if a Vornado would help.  It did.  In fact, I liked it so well, that I bought one for my elderly parents, who tend to be cold almost all the time.  They use it regularly, both in their TV room, and in the bathroom.  It's quite light and easy to transport, so they do.  THEN I decided to take my bathroom Vornado to work, since we had some ""thermostat wars"" going on and my office would suddenly turn frigid because someone else was too warm.  It worked again.  So I bought a third for the bathroom.   Nary a problem.  It's quiet.  It heats smoothly and circulates the heat as claimed.   As a result the room gets gently warmer, not the three feet of space in front of the heater.  With three units purchased at different times, I would think I would have come across one of the defective ones that others have complained about, but I have not had that happen to me.   I am very pleased",0
4029,"Good, but nothing like a commercial cleaning. This machine is probably one of the best for household cleaning, but don't expect it to turn out like a professional job. It's definitely better than renting a Rug Doctor though",0
4030,My two cats love this. We had the older (smaller) version and one cat liked it and the other didn't. But they both like this one.Why? I think it's because the water comes out higher and it reminds them of the bathtub faucet (which they love to drink from.,0
4031,"Great Electric Kettle. I have owned this kettle for several days, and it is somewhat quiet.  The water boils relatively fast.  I like the lid, which makes it easy to put water in from the faucet.  I have not had any problems with the kettle yet.  I would recommend this kettle",0
4032,Great Dog Bed!. Our German Shepherd LOVES this big comfy corner bed.  It is big enough for her to stretch out and fluffs up easily to make a very soft spot to curl up in.  The bolster is firm enough to support her if she lays against it or props her head up on it. It does not show her white hair that stands out on every other piece of furniture in the house and it washes well. The neutral color that we picked also does not draw attention to it in our bedroom.  I would definitely purchase this bed again if I ever need one.,0
4033,"Yogurt Maker. I got this as a gift because I have always wanted to make my own yogurt.  What a great gift.  Since I got it almost a month ago I have make almost 5 gallons of yogurt.  I make at least 1 batch a day and sometimes 2 batches a day.  We like to go for the longest setting and it has never gotten too tart or bitter like I have heard some say yogurt can get.  We have nice thick, creamy, yummy yogurt.  Thanks so much for offering such a great product",0
4034,"Great for on the go. I bought this a few months ago and have not stopped using it since. I get up real early in the morning to go to work and I just put the coffee in the maker at night and turn it on in the morning. As long as you follow the plastic indicators on the side so you won't overflow the mug, it's great! Very easy to clean since it's plastic, keeps the coffee pretty warm. I don't drink scolding coffee and the mugs cool it off fast enough where I can start perking up a lot sooner. The only complaint I have is the tops to the mugs. They don't seem to want to stay on so you have to hold it on with your finger and your mouth so it doesn't overflow. Other than that, it's great",0
4035,"Garlic Obsessed~!. I put this in the microwave for 1 minute and out comes the most delicious cooked garlic! You don't have to add anything to it! Cooked garlic, just by itself is very sweet- even my 2 year old enjoys it.",0
4036,"Better Than Five Stars!!!. I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives.  I finally stepped up and got excellent knives.  For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world.  Check them out on the Web at kershawknives.com.Great features of the entire line include these cool ""D"" shaped handles that fit your hand better.  Every Shun Classic knife is made in a right- and left-handed version (chefsresource.com for lefties).  The handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe!! The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives.  The knives are EXTREMELY sharp.   One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives.  The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle.9-Inch Slicing -- This is an impressive knife. It's sleek and sharp like the rest of its siblings.  I know the granton edge is supposed to reduce drag, but I'm not certain this is a necessity for a knife I use three times a year. There is a version without the grantons that's a few dollars cheaper.This is an expensive, but lifetime investment.  I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website.  For ratings on various brands and types of knives, check out cooksillustrated.coms' equipment ratings.Shun is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of.",0
4037,OK for NYC water. NYC water clogs faucet filters fast. I've tried a few  systems and so far this one has lasted the longest.  It'll go for a month+ before it needs replacement.

On Amazon, it's even set up as Prime!As for the gate itself, it's perfect.  We have a 12"" high, 13 lb. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and the height is perfect for us.  It's high enough to keep her in, and low enough to let us walk over it without a problem.

Here I have a refurbished Palinato X3; textured, very hardy stainless; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws, -170 to start (6 mo warranty).But let me correct one point made in these reviews, the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic, a rather new trend that works quite well, the steam nob as well seems to be this material.All around this is quite an improvement on the X1: more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the X1. Cups warm quicker also.It also seems to handle ground coffee a little better. Still it's important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder, and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming, fat content just makes more fat, not true foamed milk.",0
4056,Loved the flute glasses. I am so pleased at the Waterford glasses I ordered for my daughter.  I was worried about the shipping but they were packed in 4 layers and arrived in one beautiful piece.,0
4057,"Perfect in Every Way. If you're a coffee lover but the ONLY one in your house, this coffee maker is perfect for you.  I use mine every day.  It allows you to quickly brew one fresh cup of coffee at a time, and the availability of coffee pods in varying strengths and flavors is only improving.  For the money, this is a wise purchase, and it will meet your needs as a single coffee drinker in your home",0
4058,"No More Rug Doctor. After years of renting Rug Doctors, we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner.  We were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off-white carpets when they come in from playing.  Also one of them is a puppy, who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times.   After reading other reviews, we selected the Hoover F5914-900.  We wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the Hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner.  The carpets are as clean as with a bigger Rug Doctor.  We have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time.  We are very happy with our Hoover.  It is fairly light, easy to fill and empty, and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes.  As other people have commented, the attachment hose tends to fall off, so we just leave it off.   Otherwise, it's a heck of a deal!",0
4059,"Famous Maker Towel Set. I'm impressed with the quality of these towels.  I purchased them because I needed hunter green and could not find that color locally.  They are large, soft absorbent towels",0
4060,Excellent Price Plus Bonus!. How did this arrive so quickly?  It was shipped yesterday and was on my doorstep today.  This was a great deal--for some reason the blue was $30 less than other colors.  A 7 piece spatula set worth $69 was an added bonue.  Yay!,0
4061,Great. These storage bowls have been a nice addition to my dish collection. They came in great shape and have been useful. They go from firdge to microwave to the table and everything matches the dishes,0
4062,"Worked great for us!. We have four dogs, and they're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking. One of our neighbors ""strongly suggested"" this product as a possible remedy. I did some investigation before purchasing, including talking to the manufacturer. Their sense was that it works for about 50% of dogs, which is in line with what I saw in other on-line reviews at the time (this was about a year and a half ago).Anyway, because they had a good return policy I went ahead and made the purchase, and it worked wonderfully. The barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it, and in fact we wished we had bought more (we have a very big yard). That led to our downfall: we were moving it around frequently, and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch. Oops.Needless to say, it didn't work after that. But, remarkably, the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months. Now the grass is green, the buds are blooming, and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive, so it's time to replace the unit. This time I'm buying two, and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer.",0
4063,"So far, so good!. I just got my Flip It yesterday and after a trial run I am very pleased! I have Pergo laminate floors and I have tried everything out there from different mops to steamers and every cleaner under the sun and no matter what I have to wipe them with a towel or they are streaked with water marks. Even my ceramic tile in the bathrooms needs to be wiped or I get water marks. Well, NO MORE!!! I can tell that it takes some trial and error to use the machine correctly but after testing it yesterday my floors were shining! No streaks or water marks! The vacuum part is not the best so I will continue to use my regular vacuum beforehand. Not a big deal I think, since you have to vacuum using a conventional mop anyway. But washing the floor was just like ""vacuuming"" it to a shine! Finally, I don't dread washing the floors!",0
4064,Great. Great size which stores several loaves of bread or bagels. Cutting board gets stuck sometimes,0
4065,SPECIAL GIFT. Bought these for our son-in-law for Chrismas and he loved them.  I wished I had ordered two sets !!!  Maybe next time,0
4066,"Fantastic Can Opener 2 Years and Going Strong. We're coming up on two years of steady use with this little jewel and very happy with it. It takes a little practice at first learning the proper way to position it, but I'm able to do it with one hand (No I'm not Hercules). My wife also gives it 5 stars and wants me to buy an extra one in case they discontinue it. She's not very strong and has never had any problem puncturing the can to get it started. It's very compact and comes apart easily to clean. This is one of our favorite kitchen tools. Highly recommend",0
4067,"Toastylicious. As much as a toaster can, this one makes me happy :)It toasts evenly, and seems to be very well made in a tres cute-sturdy-classy way. The crumb tray is very convenient, and I think the slanted top of the toaster makes it even easier to get the toast out.  This toaster toasts slower than some of the other models that I've tried, but I think it's worth the minimal extra wait. The Amazon price is decent too, especially if you purchase it with other items so that you get the $25.00 off, and of course, who doesn't love free shipping",0
4068,A good product. The quality is pretty good. But the actual color is much brighter than it is shown on the website,0
4069,"Wonderful -- and VERY LARGE. These glasses are really wonderful for enjoying red wine.  Their very large bowls really help the air exposure that brings out the flavors in a good red.  The rims were thin and the stems delicate enough, but they didn't feel terribly fragile.  Also, I thought the packaging was just fine.  There was nothing wrong with this set in any way.However, I wouldn't recommend these glasses to anyone who is a very casual wine drinker and wants to stay that way -- or anyone with very limited cupboard space.  When I have wine enthusiasts over, they think these glasses are very appropriate.  When I have others over, they think these are weird.  The bowls are MUCH larger than your average red wine glasses.  Expect to hear ""Well, I know the red wine glasses are larger, but isn't this a little overboard?""  Of course, these people don't realize that no -- the size of these bowls is great.  But expect to have to explain.So overall, in sum:  Perfect for enjoying your red wine -- much larger than the standard size for reds, which helps you enjoy what you are drinking!  If you don't want to have to explain the ""weird"" size to guests who don't understand red wine reasonably well, or want to save cupboard space, then perhaps avoid these and go for a more standard size red wine glass",0
4070,"Unbelievable!!. I've been an amazon customer for about a decade now, but this is the first time I've written a review.  I feel I just have to.  This toy is so amazing.  I bought the cat track months ago, but my cat has not lost interest.  She plays with this thing all day and even lets me sit and hit the ball with her.  This is by far the best toy I've purchased for my cat",0
4071,Great laundry basket!. Each of the 3 compartments holds almost a full load of laundry.  The unit is skinny enough for a small laundry room.  It was easy to put together and slides around the room effortlessly.  I recommend this -- great price and great product,0
4072,"simple. This product is a real convience for someone who uses alot of hard or soft boiled eggs. Easy to clean. I never have to worry about not hearing the buzzer when the eggs are done, it is very loud and VERY annoying",0
4073,"The ULTIMATE pillow. This is the only pillow I have ever found, regardless of price, that gives me complete sleeping comfort. This pillow and I go back many, many years and I could not find it again in retail stores.  Today I received only two (what was I thinking?) from Amazon and immediately ordered two more for our cabin.  This is a ""No Brainer Buy.""  Sweet dreams",0
4074,"Good value. I am fairly pleased with this end table.  I purchased two end tables for our family room to match the coffee table.  I very much like the style, but wish the table was an inch or so taller.  The quality is only ok... I did notice minor scratches on one table after only a month of use.  But considering the price, and in comparison to other end tables in this lower price range, it is a good deal.  If possible, I would have graded it as 3 1/2 stars",0
4075,Very good use. It is nice and pretty good to use. Food and liquid it is very easy to take it off. I am satisfied with the product,0
4076,Wonderful Gift Lazy Susan. I recently got married and for one of my wedding gifts I got a pretty expensive 17 inch solid wood lazy susan. Well when I moved into my house with my husband my mother saw it and fell in love. She went on on and on about how she would love to have one for parties to put cheeses and crackers and for different things. Well they are usually pretty expensive and I was not able to find one cheap. My mom's birthday came up and I was able to find one using amazon.com not as big but as nice. I was able to send it to my mom and she loves it she uses it all the time and it stays out on the table so the grandkids can use it to choose treats. Great gift idea. This item is awesome and is better then mine it came already treated. I had to pre-treat mine since it being wood. My mom just adores it,0
4077,"Compact, Sturdy and Easy to use. Best deal for the money.  Folds up easy.  We use it in the kitchen to reach high places, it folds up and slides easily in next to the refrigerator.  Stool is sturdy, and does not slip on the floor when opened up.Great Product",0
4078,"great cutting board. when this cutting board arrived i took it out of its box, placed it over my stove top, laid my head on it and laughed from sheer joy.it covers the top of my stove exactly.  the wood is beautiful and warm.i got mine late november early december, and i use if everyday at least once, and it still looks new.  it is easy to clean, even if i left cut tomatoe and avocado or something, the stains wipe right off.p.s.  i only use mine to cut fruit and veggies....we are vegetarian.",0
4079,"Form proceeds function with this set of dishes. I fell in love with the graceful lines and understated elegance of this set.  But when the pieces were delivered it quickly became apparent that this oversized set is not designed for everyday use.  The pieces are difficult to fit into my dishwasher as well as the dishracks purchased to help organize my cupboards.  The mugs are huge and would require many pots of coffee when entertaining guest unless you want to fill them only part way.  The ""bowls"" which can be ordered separately are designed to gorge if one was to actually fill them to capapcity.Not to mention, from what I have discovered during my research on the net, apparently they are quite easy to chip and are limited in thier safeness in the dishwasher and microwave (both on low heat settings) I love the look of them, but it is probably not one of my wiser investments.",0
4080,Filter for hard water. Still allows some dust deposits. Live in AZ and don't have water softener. Need to change more often than recommended,0
4081,"Great vacuum.  Cleans like crazy. Pros:Easy to use.  Very adaptable system.  Tools and manual cleaning system are at your fingertips.  Very long power cord and attachment hose.  Incredible suction.  Emptying the bin is trivial, and essentially a clean process.  Contrary to competitor claims, Dyson vacs do *not* spew dust into the house.  In fact, the lifetime filter is user cleanable making the whole unit basically cost free--again, a trivially simple process.Cons:This thing sucks so hard that it's difficult to push on deep pile carpet.  I called Dyson about this and they had me remove two very thin seals from the beater-bar head.  The result completely fixed the issue.  There was no apparent loss of cleaning capability.  The power cord is exceptionally long.  Unfortunately, it does not automagically retract.  The long cord can get in ones way, however one does not have to move it from plug to plug as much.  Yes, it's plastic.  But other reviews have indicated reliability and good support from Dyson.Both my wife and I find the Dyson to be an excellent purchase. We've had lots of problems with vacuums because of three dogs and long haired humans.  This machine does a much better job of things and is much easier to use.Worth the money?  Time will tell.  The reason why we selected Dyson is because of all the good reviews all over the Net.   So far, it has exceeded our expectations",0
4082,Nice pillow. Just like it's rated this pillow is worth the cost. It does take a few days to get use to but when you do it's great,0
4083,"Emma, the chocolate lab, can't play with this enough. Can a retriever have too much fun with a toy??",0
4084,Beautiful addition to collection. I purchased this for my mother after she bought the set of dishes at the Lenox outlet store.  It is just adorable!  This is a great accent if you have the Butterfly Meadow Dishes.  Also a great price compared to other retailers.  Thanks Amazon,0
4085,I'm cookin' fer a livin and... Picked up 2 of deez bad lil' sauce pans for work and they perform as well as my solid copper Mauviel. Quick heat transition and holding...easy and quick to clean. I must add that this adonized finish requires extra care...not as much as copper but more than MC2 or Stainless AllClad...but I don't mind... I like LTD and I have 27 pieces at work now.I'm shoppin' for a full set at home now!!!4+ mojo*z for these rugged performers only because the finish requires extra car,0
4086,"A great product!. My son desperately loves anything Star Wars, but being as he is only 5, we limit him on what he can have.  The Galactic Heroes collection is wonderful.  The comforter is soft, washes up nice, and really cute!  I wish I had had this stuff when I was a kid",0
4087,"Great little piece at a ""teaser"" price!. I have to say that I am very happy with my All-Clad Ltd pieces, including this little fry pan.  Because of the price, I picked up this one and the 1 qt. sauce pan to give them a try.  My family used to cook with the all ss line so I knew that these would be quality and I was not let down.  Yes, stainless is more difficult to cook with, but have you tried hard anodised pots? impossible.  That's why my equally beautiful (IMO) Calphalon professional pots are looking great as kitchen decorations and not much else.  Your food will only burn if you are not paying attention to it.  If you are having this problem, try non-stick, so you can go do whatever else it is you want to do other than paying attention to your food.  If you are looking for top quality cookware that is oven safe, lasts a lifetime, and demands a little more care from the chef......this is it",0
4088,"Couldn't live without it. I have had my tea maker for 6 years and use it all the time.  I have used other tea makers at my Mom's and she has went through 3 to my one.  I rec'd it as a wedding gift so I have been looking for one for my Mom.  I only wish they made it in a larger size.  I usually make it strong enough for 4 quarts and just pour it over into my larger pitcher.  Love, Love, Love it",0
4089,"It's worth every penny... If you love crepes and enjoy making all kinds of recipes with them, you absolutely should invest in this pan.  I say ""invest"" because it's pricey, but All-Clad is worth every penny.  I'm slowly upgrading all my cookware to All-Clad and I'm very pleased with everything.  I must say that delicate crepes are hard to make because the paper-thin crepe is hard to flip.  Always adding tons of butter or Crisco to the pan each time you pour the crepe batter adds too many additional calories.  The non-stick surface on this pan is the best I've ever used and you can use this pan for any number of recipes besides crepes.  I'm very very pleased and satisfied with my purchase",0
4090,"Plates Are Good, thats about it. I bought these during an amazon one day sale for $35, me and my girlfriend are soon looking to get our own place and wanted to buy something that is decent but not two expensive.  I'll try to give good descriptions of everything to give the buyer a good idea of what to expect.  When amazon says 35lbs they are not kidding, it is a VERY heavy box.  Towle silversmiths are the actual company that makes the set.  They are made in China.  According to the box IT IS dishwasher safe, but IS NOT microwave safe.  That would be due to the metal band around the edges of the plates.This review is for the platinum set, amazon didn't have it listed on the website when i was going to review them so this is close enough.  All the items appear very nice the bands are all uniform and matching.  It looks like tableware you would expect to find in a NICE new england bed and breakfast.  Very timeless, and classic, but modern in a sense as well.The plates, bowl's, and coffee cups are nice and heavy and look quite elegant.  They are of good weight and don't feel flimsy at all. They come with decorative plates for underneath the main plate however i wouldn't ever consider using them, the only they they are useful for is target shooting or playing frisbee.The flatware is ok, they are on the light side and somewhat bland.  The forks and spoons flex but also appear as if they would bend under normal use, the knifes feel ok but again all the flatware is on the flimsy side, I would recommend getting an additional set somewhere else.  They are not so thin that they would bend right away like the usual 'college' first set that most people would buy at either Linens and Things or Bed Bath and Beyond or Target.  But i've had better.The wine glasses are the same way, they are a medium thickness glass, they are by no means high quality but they are not the cheapo ones you would expect to find at target or the cheap ones at LNT or BBB.  One of mine had an air bubble in it, im gonna request a new one from amazon.  They are ok tall stems and good base, they feel very sure footed on the table and accompany the dishes nicely in design.  They are a large bowl Red Wine glass design.If you need the dishes buy it, they are well worth what i paid for it for the dishes alone, i plan on buying new flatware.  The glasses I'll use till they break.  Overall for $35 i am very pleased and wish i had bought a second set for the plates alone",0
4091,Great Product at a Great Price. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality cookware,0
4092,"Gorgeous, well-made, but. . . Only 4 stars because the side holes are so large that smaller apples and tangerines fall right through.  It is an incredible value for the money, though",0
4093,"Easy to use, I reach for these first. I've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty, gloppy mess I throw in it, including shortening, butter, cream cheese, sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine. I spend less time cleaning up then I would have with glass as more is pushed out. I haven't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version. They both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are",0
4094,"Simply the best!. Le Creuset has one of the best reputations out there, coming from professional chefs to the everyday at home chef.  Le Creuset has quality, durability and beauty.  Based on collected articles and other positive feedback, I purchased my first piece ever from Le Creuset on another web site and I love it.  I agree with it all.  As a matter of fact, it is this same oval platter that I purchased from another web site and when I wanted another one, they were sold out.  Amazon had it and I just had to purchase it.  It's a multi purpose serving platter that looks great on any table setting.  It's durable, I've banged it a few times (quite by accident may I add) and there is not even a scratch on it.  All Le Creuset products are expensive, but very well worth it.  I see these platters lasting a very, very long time.",0
4095,Pretty good. I really like this product.  My only complaint with it is that it doesn't quite fit my faucet.  But I like the space it allows for and it really has helped keep my granite countertops water-free.  I recommend it as long as you can fit it around your faucet,0
4096,"Yet another wonderful knife from Henckels... Henckels knives are quality - you can tell just by the feel of their knives. This line is also weighty, and balance just right in you hands.

That's when this knife shines through.And of course it's from Wusthof so you know it is the best.We love it",0
4100,"Buy a Bigger size. I really love these sheets. After I bought the sheets I read other peoples reviews, because I was new to amazon and didnt realize there were reviews. So I was worried when they were on there way to me, that they wouldnt fit. So I recieved them and put them on my bed and they were huge, so I felt a little better about them not fitting. I washed them and dried them, and went to put them on my bed and it was a tight fit, but it fit, and I was very pleased. But then I realized that I bought a Cal King and I have a regular King. So my suggeston would be if you want these sheets buy a bigger size. But as to the sheets, they are not soft but not hard, my husband and I love them, and we want to buy more. One more suggestion if you buy them is to line dry them, I did that the second time I washed just to make sure they wouldnt shrink anymore",0

4110,"Mine's in 1 piece and works great. I'm with Amalfi girl. I have this pan and it works great- most importantly, the lid is heavy enough to weigh down the sandwiches. (The trick to these panini pans is that you must heat them thoroughly with the lid on before placing the sandwich inside. That way the top gets toasted at the same time.) As for those other two,I can't even imagine a cast iron pan breaking in shipment! The ones that did must have been from a defective lot. Wow! They have my sympathies",0

The old ones had a little ring of a handle that few adults could use comfortably. While the art deco design is lovely, using the old mugs was miserable and not the comforting ""morning coffee"" experience we've come to expect from no-nonsense diner mugs.Anyway, Fiestaware has finally taken note and given us a proper mug with a proper handle... and it's a realistic size, too, not like the cartoonishly oversized jumbo mug which is more suited for soup or cereal than coffee.

After I got over the initial disappointment in size I realized they were really great to have for prep. I am going back to school to be a chef and am really trying to practice Mise En Place in my own kitchen (I think that is how you spell it, I better learn before my final). This set is great for the prep because it has two measuring amounts in one (like 3/4 cup and 1.5 in the same cup), which I came to realize has helped. I bought these and the OXO 4-piece prep bowl set with lids assuming I would try both and give one away, I ended up keeping and using both",0
4114,"Great new Gaggia Super!!. I just purchased the Gaggia Titanium, and boy, what a machine!  This thing is idiot-proof, not to mention it looks great on my counter top!  I was so impressed by the styling, that I didn't pay attention to the actual ""function"" of the machine at first, but when I did, I was in awe!  Never having used a super auto, I was used to an old Krups I had purchased at a flea market that actually worked once every other blue moon!  So using the Gaggia every morning for my cup of joe made me feel like I was in heaven!  The speed of making a latte in the wee morning hours is unbelievable, and the machine's ability to automatically froth my milk for me really makes it a breeze!  I highly recommend this machine to anyone who is looking for an easy to use super automatic machine.",0

I did some research and found that this product was at the top of the list when it came to shower filter experiences. There are other ones out there, but this one was well documented. I ended up purchasing the unit to see if it would help a skin condition. I haven't used the unit long enough to notice, but I can say that there is a noticeable difference in the way my skin and hair feels.My skin is more moist and softer to the touch than without the filter. The steam that forms smells fresher and the shower head provides a nice stable stream. Overall a great product and I hope to report back with my long term results.",0

A word of warning from the manufacturer is very true:  ""WARNING  Knives sharpened on the Chef's Choice will be sharper than you expect.  Use them with great care.""  I taped their warning to our knife rack as a reminder.  In short, the manufacturer's instructions are very easy to follow, and the knife sharpener is very easy to use as well.  It's a little pricey, but if you want really sharp knives you won't be disappointed.  You can sharpen all your kitchen knives, serrated knives, and pocket knives, too.  My knives are sharper than when I bought them.  Good Luck",0

A word of caution that may be obvious to some -- wok rings are not universally sized to fit.  Recognizing that the one that came with the wok might not work, we were prepared to search for one that would but were not prepared for how difficult that would be.  Meanwhile, the local Chinese restaurant and my cast iron skillet are getting too much use. The search goes on.",0

I'm not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it.  I have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there, which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross.  Especially water.  Who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face?  Not me.  Not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything.  It smells good and I can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some.A great mug you should buy.",0

These gifts earned sincere thanks and were put into use promptly. The switch on the hotplate (as opposed to on the cord) and On/Off light were cited as winning features. Hotplate housing allows fit of average mugs. Operational cons?

It's a lovely piece, and for the money, you really can't beat it...and I even got it 15% off!  I'm no help when it comes to the ease of putting it together - my fiance handled that for me.  However, the one reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the predrilled holes on first buffet that was shipped did not line up correctly, and we had to get a replacement one shipped to us.  This was taken care of by Target in a very accomodating, expedient manner.  As one other reviewer pointed out, it is petite...take careful note of the measurements.  All in all, I love it.

Although called a stir-fry pan by the manufacturer, this is actually a good general-use pan for tasks like making risotto and cooking various sauces, in addition to stir-frying. The bottom may be a little flat for stir-frying purists, but this what makes the pan good for other tasks. I already had a pan like this one that was about four years old and going strong, when the glass top slipped and shattered on our tiled kitchen floor. The top is an important part of the pan for some uses, so I had to order a new one.I use this pan nearly every evening for cooking something. It heats evenly, retains heat well, and is very good value for the cost. The only reason it got four stars instead of five is its size--it is a bit large for an ordinary stove like ours--but its versatility makes up for this one problem",0

It was much more work than any other gadget I have and it wasn't worth it.  This is the perfect solution.  The frying pan is perfect for searing rib eyes or filets and then popping them in the oven to roast which gives you a far better result than broiling them.  The nonstick interior cleans up with paper towels and water and you don't need to put it in the dishwasher which is forbidden anyway.  The pan is so heavy that when you preheat it to sear you are able to completely sear a couple of steaks at a time.  It's so heavy you could stop a whole band of coyotes with this thing no matter what they'd purchased from the Acme Corporation.  It works very well with an induction cooking top too.  The handle is bare porcelain enamel and it gets warm so consider buying a silicone handle cover especially if you have a gas range.  Last but not least it has spouts for pouring off deglazing liquids to make those great reduction sauces",0

4153,"2001 model still going strong! Great espresso. Having worn out a Capresso machine after daily brewing 4-6 shots of espresso in making lattes/cappuccinos, etc. I went looking for a more durable machine.I bought an X1 in 2001/2 when it was a brand new model (in stainless) and it is great:1. It heats up quickly.2. It brews VERY consistently.3. The ESE thing is the best mess-preventer ever.4. Separate steam-temperature setting is great. Heats milk much faster than other, cheaper consumer models.5. Machine has capacity to steam enough milk for at least 3 tall lattes before needing a quick ""refill"" of water from the pump switch.6. I like the simplicity and total manual operation. The switches aren't labeled, but there's only 3. Kind of a morning meditation for me.The most important, non-obvious things:1. Don't leave a pod in the holder and move temperature to steam setting. When you unhook the pod holder, steam will instantly blow apart the ESE pod, which, given that it is more than boiling hot, will hurt, plus will dry instantly on the wall.2. Use INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED ESE pods, unless you use them all within 2-3 hours of opening the tin. They sour very quickly, even in the freezer. I am partial to Starbucks pods, given my household's addiction to that brand, but I think that is more of a preference than a quality issue. Illy tastes fine, but you have to use them all quickly.3. If you serve a lot of guests, the double unit (X3?) might be better. With the dual-temperature settings, you'll spend a lot of time running water through the unit to cool the steam setting back down to brew the next batch of espresso. Lots of refills of the water container, which is a bit of a pain to remove from the back of the machine.Overall, a great performer after 4 years of daily, multiple use. This thing is a great machine",0

4195,"Vaccum Review. Overall, it was a good choice.   It 's got great suction and I like the fact that there are no bags.  The only negative is that it is rather heavy and difficult to carry up and down stairs.  Otherwise, it's a great choice",0
4196,"""More than adequate for the price"". I was downsizing when I purchased this microwave--both in size and in heat content. My biggest satisfaction with this product was that it fit the small space that had been created in my kitchen cabinet design for a microwave. My second goal had been to have an all-white product, which is hard to find in today's black or stainless appliance kitchens. I have no complaints about the heating quality or the control choices. My only reminder of a lesser-product is that the door makes the sound a metal door will make, when it is opened or closed. But this product is more than adequate for the price",0

4199,"For Kittens of All Ages. Do you have a kitten?  Or perhaps a cat that THINKS he's a kitten even though his whiskers are turning gray?This IS the toy for you!  I not only own it, I have given it as a gift.I have seven cats and not only do they play on this Tree, they sleep on it and most importantly, they sharpen their claws on it, thereby saving me the hassle of clawed furniture.The one I own is now three years old and has held up well.  It looks like a well-beloved baby blanket, but it is still intact.The price is very reasonable, compared to other cat climbing/playing structures I've seen and if you need to store it, it is easily moved from one room to another.But don't be surprised when Kitty sees it in the new room and starts actinglike it's a brand new toy!Oh, are you wondering about any negative aspects to the Claw Pals Cat Tree? There is only one.My 24-pound cat tips it over.  :",0
4200,"Nice looking but not rugged. A nice looking product,great for cutting soft foods like bananas but for serious kitchen use this board falls short- it's prone to slipping down under heavier use",0
4201,Nice dish. Works great and the handle on top is a much needed feature.  My old butter dish (not fiestaware)did not have one of these and that is how it broke by being dropped,0
4202,"Was skeptical, but not anymore!. I was worried that these collars would somehow allow them to choke because they don't ""break away"", they open. I thought that maybe they wouldn't open or maybe the ring would get caught, but so far they haven't. With other break away collars, my cats would maybe have them on for 1-2 days and then they would be lost to the woods never to be found again. They have had these for almost a week and they have not lost them yet nor have they snagged or loosened at all. Plus the cats can't get them off like they could the other break away collars and it's so small in width that it hasn't matted there hair. A wonderful product and I would definitely reccommend to anyone who has a problem keeping collars on their cats. At a couple of bucks a piece, you can't beat it.",0
4203,"Large,  Big, or huge Pot?. Make sure you really understand the size of this pot before ordering, I mean this thing is huge. Said that, I like it all arround, heats even, handles maintain reasonably warm (not hot), nice the see through lid, and overall it looks very professional",0
4204,"So far, so good!. I've got two little ones, a 2 year old boy, and a 3 year old girl.  My first worry after reading many of the reviews was that most who seemed to be having success had cats under a year old.  Well I'm about 3 weeks in, and so far they are adapting nicely.The instructions in the kit stated to put the litterbox by the toilet for a week, then just take it away and put the Citikitty kit on the toilet.  Well after a day of some panicked looks and panicked meowing, I decided to take a step back.  I put the thing on the floor and started raising it a few inches every few days.  I'm happy to say that we just graduated to putting it straight on the toilet!  I'm taking much longer than the kit recommends at each step, as I am very determined to make this work, so I'm sure they appreciate that as well.Downside: My bathroom has never looked worse...there is litter flung and tracked EVERYWHERE.  But I would go through that for a year if I had to in order to ensure the next 15 years would be litter free!  Another downside is, as others have stated, there is no going back in steps ones the holes are punched.  I think I will be cutting my own much more gradually than the perforated ones.I think the holepunching process is what will make or break this deal!  But as I said, I'll go as slow as I have to.  I'll check back in a few weeks with an update",0
4205,"77 stitches?. I received my new sewing machine and love the way it works.  I am not in love with the confusing directions on the sewing stitch functions.  To the best of my knowledge I really only have 35 stitches possible.  There is no customer service number on my manual to talk to someone live and has led to frustration.  Ultimately, I still love the way the machine performs, with or without the other 30+ stitches",0
4206,"I love this little salt server!. When I was looking, I found it hard to find something that was small and attractive.  Most are way too large for my kitchen and my needs.  This one looks great and holds just a small amount of my course sea salt; it is perfect",0

4208,An excellent  lightweight  vacuum. I didn't expect this vacuum to be as economical as it turned out.It's lightweight and has a powerful motor.  Picks up dog hair well and cleans carpets deeply.  I have combination wood floors with area rugs and the floor or carpet settings are easy to switch back and forth.  The cup holder for dirt and dust cleans without fuss and so does the filter. This nicely designed appliance makes vacuuming easy,0
4209,"Best money I've spent for the kitchen in years. I have owned a variety of cookware from cast-iron skillets to fancy-name porcelain pots.  Almost all have frustrated me to some extent, but to be fair, I am not a ""light-handed"" chef in the kitchen.  I thought long and hard about how to get the best value for replacements out of a limited budget.  I dreamed of big-dollar brands made from stainless or copper, but I had to be reasonable.  One day in desperate need for a new Teflon skillet, I noticed a Farberware Millennium non-stick on sale at a local shop, and I liked the feel of it.  I took it home and liked it enough to buy an omelet pan a few weeks later.  A year-plus on, I needed a more comprehensive rennovation of my cookware, and my experience and research led me to this stainless Millenium set.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  The feel is substantial but not too heavy for slinging around the kitchen.  Soft-Touch eases the burden, too.  It heats extremely well -- quickly and evenly -- on my electric stove.  I handwash the new set, but even my Teflon Millennium pans look pretty darned good after repeated dishwasher cycles in hard water.  For new and experienced cooks on a budget, I strongly recommend the Millennium stainless",0
4210,"Chopped ice and a conversation piece. Since we do not have a through the door ice dispenser with an automatic ice crusher, yet had a ""pressing"" need for crushed ice for our Mojitos I began a quest for a sturdy and effective ice crusher.  After trying several of the plastic ones out there I found this one and am happy with it.The price was right, it looks good sitting on my bar shelf and, most importantly, it chops ice well.  It is a little smaller than I expected but the hopper holds enough of my freezer's ""half moon"" cubes to fill a drink glass.If you are looking to crush ice for a food platter this is not your machine due to volume.  It does require a bit of strength but jams are easily overcome by turning the crank in the opposite direction.One warning, the handle comes very close to the base so you do have to be careful not to catch a knuckle at the bottom of a turn",0
4211,"Fantastic dishes!. Love these dishes - my family has them at our summer cottage (original ones of course) and that I can buy the reissues for my house, and at such a great price, is fantastic.Great prices - and no problems with the shipping",0

4213,"Good product, Good Value. This is a significant improvement over the 750 model. The 750 model was not very well designed. The first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. We returned this. We got the 760 to replace that. The 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. For the same price as the 750, the 760 comes with one extra bowl,  juicer and egg whisk. Compared with others like the Cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed.",0

4215,Excellent-. I have owned a cuisinart stock pot for several years and use it all the time. One can not beat the sear that a stainless pot provides.  The new set is just as good. I have been using the stainless more and more and the hard anodized that it replaces less and less.  (There is a reason that the cooking show chefs all use stainless).  Just remember to use a lower heat than you normally do since these pans seem to heat up faster and hotter,0
4216,"Very Pleased. I was very pleased with this product. I gave them as a present. The only reason I did not give a five star is because I ordered three sets and one set was chipped and scratched up. However, the return process was excellent. It was just aggrevating that I was giving it as a gift and had to go through the return process. But the product itself was perfect for what I was looking for",0
4217,"Hoover FloorMate. Overall, the unit is very good.  However, the newer model has spinning brushes which makes cleaning a breeze.  This one takes a little elbow grease but definitely does the job",0
4218,It works!. I used the Zorb in high traffic area. It removes dirt and the carpet looks new after Zorb cleaning. I applies twice a year on the high traffic area like the stair and it keeps the high traffic area as good as the rest of the carpet.,0
4219,"Stoneware Casserole. This is a high-fired stoneware casserole. Its non-porous enamel is same as on iron cast pots by Le Creuset and it looks great.  Because it is stoneware, it can be put in a freezer and then microwaved. Though it's excellent for baking and can be brought to the table for serving as well, I give it only four stars because it's not unique in its baking qualities and I can get same results in Corning casserole for a fraction of a price.  As for cast iron Dutch ovens, I didn't find substitutes so far",0
4220,"Powerful fan!. This fan is so powerful. Even on low, it is impressive. Easy assembly, feels sturdy, and I love the remote and timer. The only cons are that you can't control the oscillation by remote and it is loud. I would recommend this fan to anyone.",0
4221,"good. I wish they were a little bigger, but i like that they are stackable and come with the organizer.  it was worth the money",0

4223,"The DTC 975 is the best coffee maker we ever owned!. Read this if you are a serious coffee drinker like us! We have been buying, using and tossing out coffee makers for the past 45 years. We have used every type known; percolaters, presses, Melita gravity cones, and etc. This coffee maker is the best! This Cuisinart is a cinch to use and the coffee tastes great. This is my second one. the first one is still cranking out good coffee after over five years of daily use. We purchased the new Cuisinart so that we could put the old Cuisinart on our motorhome permanently for use whenever we travel.The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot and tasty for hours. The carafe is rugged stainless steel in and out. I thought that it may not keep the coffee hot long enough because of the thermal transmission of steel vs. glass. (our old one has a glass vacuum bottle inside.) Not so! It works great. We always pre-heat by rinsing the carafe with a little hot water before we start. Some people commented that the carafe lid is difficult to screw on. This takes a little gentle technique development. After about two patient attemps it becomes second nature. We run a little warm water over the lid. That helps the threads to slip into place. Be sure to turn the lid until it stops at its limit. Its easy. The gravity actuated ""ball check"" valve in the lid is ingenious. It automatically closes when you stop pouring and set the carafe down. When you want to pour, you just tilt the carafe. Gravity works on the ball check. The valve opens instantly and automatically. How clever is that? Nothing to twist, no clumsy levers to push as in the abominable Mr. Coffee thermal unit. The Cuisinart simply works great!Regarding one reviewer's comment about the possibility of overflow, the subsequent mess and bail valve clogging with grounds: I experienced this only once. I think the cause was that (1). I  overfilled the bail with too much coffee. (2). I used a very heavy paper filter. (3). I had ground the coffee too finely in our home grinder. As a result of all three factors, the coffee could not drip through as fast as the boiler was feeding hot water into the bail. 'Nuff said.Controls are simple. The front control and viewing screen location is more convenient than our old one which has a side mounted switch. The clock is a handy feature but, we have never used the pre-setting timer. The water fill measuring tube works perfectly. We use reverse osmosis purified water so we do not need to clean the unit very often and of course, the coffee tastes better.The black color with the stainless carafe and trim is a handsome combination. However, more importantly, the carafe lid does not show coffee colored staining over time as the white colored unit does.I recommend this coffeemaker to everyone who loves good coffee!",0
4224,wonderful product. I purchased this for my little yorkshire terrier to stay in when we all leave the house to go to work.  Its wonderful.  It is the perfect size and doesnt take up alot of room. My little dog likes to jump up and stand against the walls of this product and they dont fall or shake so it is very sturdy yet very light.  It took me a minute to assemble the product and the little door makes it so great we leave it open and my little dog goes in and comes out when he wants.  This is a great buy and cheap too,0

4231,"Works for me!. I have 2 cats and they are 8 months now. I started them on the citty kitty about 2 months prior and so far its great. I was fortunate to have already placed their litter boxes in the bathroom so drawing them from that to the toilet was easy. For my cats it seems they follow the litter. They also love to [...] on fresh litter especially after I cleaned and replaced it =-). I bought 2 training cats for the 2 toilets I have in my house and they use both of them well. Once I placed the kits on the toilets and poured fresh litter on it they were ready to use it. I am on the last 3 rings and am confident they will have no problems. It looks like now they are working their aim (into the actual toilet) and scraping as much litter in the hole.The only thing I suggest is if your cat likes a clean litter ensure you clean the kit daily. My male cat got pist one time and pee'd in the corner of the bathroom. Thats the only time any of them made ""mistakes"".Punching holes can be a mess too. Suggest getting disposable gloves. Also sometimes your cat may miss or splatter or what have you. I bought a bunch of those cleaning wipes for the bathroom so that before anyone uses the toilet they can wipe off any excess litter or splashes and toss it in the toilet. Lastly learn your kitty's bathroom routine. Last thing you need is both of you showing up at the bathroom ready to go",0
4232,"Very good but one big flaw. I like this spatula I do, but if you are working with dough it is useless. The spatula end is detachable--which I recommend when washing because bits of food can get stuck in the seam and inside the spatula tip. I use it all the time.However with doughy mixes it is useless and I go back to the old wooden one. The spatula tip just comes off and gets stuck in dough. If it was one solid mold with no chance of detaching I would give it five stars.",0
4233,"nice cup. This is a nice cup. The top was easy to get off once I figured out it unscrews. I'd give it 5 stars if it was dishwasher safe, but it keeps coffee nice and hot and isn't tippy, so I am darn happy with it",0

This model has very sturdy plastic parts that are easy to clean and with proper care I anticipate will last a lifetime.Be sure to completely dry the freezer bowl after using and then pop it right back into the freezer wrapped in an airtight plastic bag.  That way you'll have the bowl ready for those times you just have to have ice cream.  I've made many lower-fat versions using skim milk and fat-free half and half and my family loves it",0

4249,"Thank you, Bionaire.... Our house has a very damp basement and to combat that we purchased a Bionaire BDQ 24 about a year and a half ago and it worked just dandy until a little over a week ago when all of a sudden it simply stopped pulling in any moisture. Just like that. Fan still spins when you power it up, but no moisture collects in the reservoir. From what I've gleaned in the past week about the workings of dehumidifiers over the internet, the 'compressor' on the unit must have bugged out.Well...I phoned Bionaire's customer service line and they offered to immediately replace my defective BDQ 24 with this model the BDQ 25 as the BDQ 24 was out of stock and wouldn't be available until November. November?!A few days later, the UPS trcuk arrives with our new dehumidifier.This model looks a lot like the model 24 only it's bigger--it is very elegantly designed (for a dehumidifier) and so far it seems to work just great, pulling in pint after pint of H-2-O.Here's the rub: I must dock this product ONE STAR because it is Extremely NOISY!! By 'noisy' I don't mean refrigerator noisy. I am talking jumbo jet taking off in your living room noisy. It is one LOUD MUTHA!I have no idea how Bionaire feels they can get away with referring to this machine as 'Quie-tech'. But it works.I just hope they fixed the bugs with the faulty compressor in this model. Time will tell with regard to that issue. Anyway it does have a 2 year warranty.Oh. And that wireless indicator is junk. Synched it up with the unit and then all it did was beep. Wife made me yank out the batteries. Very annoying.--Bil",0

I bought a rice cooker because I have never been able to make decent rice in a pot (yes, I know it's been done for centuries and is supposed to be so easy).  This rice cooker is exactly what I expected (perfection) in all but two ways:  1)you can make up to 10 cups of rice, but not less than 3.  I didn't realize that when I bought it.  I have occasionally made a lot more rice than I needed.  2) depending on the rice, sometimes the bottom layer of rice gets a little too much heat (i.e. crispy).  This doesn't happen with Japanese rice, which is my favorite.  It does happen with cheap rice.  It hasn't been that big of a deal -- compared to undercooked or overcooked rice, these are minor things",0

The movie encompasses several of the first books of the series. And the poster is indicative of both.You will need room to display this 27 x 40 poster.

4259,"New religious collar!. What can I say about this collar? That it works, miracles.It's one piece, instead of a box that hangs off of a regular nylon collar, ensuring contact. It also has a right fit test to make sure it's doing it's job. It's waterproof, even allowing the dog to swim with it on. No, on/off buttons on the collar itself, it turns on/off like a tv remote. Using the remote, which comes with a lanyard, you can be far from your dog, which is let's face it, when they tend to misbehave anyway.There is 9 levels, and a boost that let's you up it by 2 for that moment. There is also a timeout safety feature in case you hold the button down for 10 seconds or longer. The best part is the tone button. The manual says you can use it for a reward or warning, just not the two. That would just confuse Fido. My dog learned quickly that the tone means a warning. That way, if I press that button, she acknowledges it, and stops the behavior straight away. This also means there's no correction after awhile, since the dog learns what comes after the tone. Unless you use it for a reward sound. Then I guess it's more like clicker training.So, why is it the new religious collar?Because it makes a believer out of the dog. And, since the dog sees the behavior as getting a correction, and not you giving it, it seems to make training quicker. Because of course you don't want your dog afraid of you.Now, I know there are people who think it's inhumane to use a collar like this. Personally we tried the citronella collar, and I wish I'd saved my money. It didn't do squat for our Doberman. I think this collar is more humane than having a dog put down, which is exactly what people do when they find they can't handle their unruly, aggressive dogs",0

4262,"The last knife block you will need to buy!!. This is the biggest knife block I could find and I love it.  It is very well made, stable, and well designed (knife positions).  Many other large blocks have the cleaver slot at the very top, even thought most cleavers are only 6 inches long while chef's knives are up to 14 inches.  This block also fits many knives into a relatively small space.  I have had blocks that only hold 10 or so knives and this one is not that much bigger.  The only competition for this block is the Henckel 22 slot-block (with the cleaver on top) and the chef knife slots are not wide enough to hold serious chef knives (read the reviews for yourself).My only complaint for this block (so really a 4.5 rating) is that it has slots for 5 paring knives.  Who needs 5 little knives?  This is a serious block for serious cooks who generally use larger knives, so I feel that 3 little slots would be sufficient.  After all, a little knife can fit in a large slot, but not the other way around.  I have modified mine a bit to hold more large knives, but everyone likes different knives.The only thing better than this block is finding the knives to fill it with",0
4263,peace of mind. i dont do a lot of bread making but i am an avid meat smoker and griller. the taylor classic roast-yeast thermometer has taken the stress out of preparing a feast for my guests. i have tried more expensive thermometers but some read out an obvious wrong temperature and others are very difficult to read. the taylor thermometer solves both problems! whether you do most of your cooking outdoors or in your kitchen this thermometer will give you peace of mind. well worth the price and ships fast,0
4264,"Great Starter Yanagiba!. I recently began working in a Sushi Bar, where I was required to invest in my own knives.  I wanted a good knife but didn't want to pay an exorbitant amount.  Some Yanagiba and other sushi knives can cost upwards of $1000 a piece! I purchased this 10.5"" Bunmei Yanagiba Knife and have found it exceeded my expectations.  The blade is constantly exposed to moisture from fish, vegetables, fruit, and cleaning, and is rust free thus far.  It's easy to care for, and holds a great edge.I use this yanagiba mainly for slicing sashimi and sushi rolls.  It cuts effortlessly through most things and the grip is comfortable, even when my hands are wet.   As a bonus it arrived with a mean factory edge!  I didn't even have to pre-sharpen it and haven't had to sharpen it once after a week of moderate to heavy use.  Highly recommended for starters who've never worked with Japanese cutlery before",0
4265,"works wonders. This product truly works wonders... No it doesn't harm your animal in any way.. The only slight down-side is, at least my dog does this, the animal learns to bark soft enough that the collar won't spray.",0
4266,"Great heavy lasagna pan. This is a great looking 9x13 pan with good proportions.  It is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna.  It is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna.  Its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven, but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done.  I have made many other things in this pan with great results.  It is fairly non-stick and has not stained even after several lasagnas.  The enamel is fairly bulletproof.Overall I really like this pan, with its only weakness being heft.  However, that heft is put to good use in very even cooking and keeping the lasagna warm at the table.You won't be disappointed",0
4267,"Great design, compact and handy. It seems I've spent years trying to find the ""perfect"" teakettle. Something that would give an good honest, audible whistle when boiling, then allow one to pour the steaming hot water without having to put a hand anywhere near the spout.That didn't seem like much to ask, but we had a heck of a time finding such a thing. We found some that were close, but which you can fill only through the spout. It seems to me that one should have a lid on a pot like this, to be able to get inside and clean it, inspect for damage or wear, or whatever.And suddenly, we came across this one. On Amazon there was a 4-cup version, and two 8-cup versions. There is one with a copper bottom to resemble the traditional Revereware look, but after looking at the pictures, we bought the one that is pure stainless steel top to bottom.The entire top of the pot is a non-shiny plastic of some kind -- one of those new space-age materials that does not get as hot as metal or some other materials. The designers at Revere should be commended for making a total break with tradition so they could create a pot that is so practical. The lid on top is not centered beneath the handle, which means you can reach inside, or fill it, more easily than in the typical pot where the handle gets in the way.The handle is very well balanced and the ""trigger"" to open the spout is well-positioned. You can hold the spout partly open, or pull it completely open, at which point the trigger ""locks"" it in the open position. This saves a lot of finger fatigue when pouring multiple cups of tea, or whatever.To close it, one simply pushes forward on the back of the trigger. You don't need the instructions, although they are included. When you pick this thing up to pour with it, it feels totally natural in your hand, and you figure it out instinctively. It's great.The spout has a slight diagonal ""crease"" in its tip for drip-free pouring, which is just another thoughtful feature in an overall thoughtful and original design.We chose the larger size mostly to be able to serve more than a couple of people at a time if we should have company. And we're glad we made that choice, because honestly the 8-cup version looks small compared to our old kettle. The other one was more rounded and perhaps a larger capacity. I haven't measured the capacity of the Revere model, as I'm not that obsessed with it, and I'm sure it will suit our needs. I suspect that the compact appearance is most likely a function of efficient design.This is one of those purchases that, in its own small way, makes every day better by improving a small task that one does frequently. Of course it's far too early to tell how it will stand up to long use, but we're quite satisfied with ours and expect it to be a pleasure for a long time",0
4268,"These HEPA replacement filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04150. Although it doesn't mention it, these HEPA replacement filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04150. I had to email Hamilton Beach to find out, but they were very helpful and responded right away. When the filters arrived from Amazon, I saw that on the box it says ""Fits Models 04160, 04161 & 04150.""With our cat and houseful of antiques, we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around. I run this model in our office, under the table which holds the computer. Since placing it there I have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated. I placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job. The regular settings can be louder than expected, but I leave them on the ""whisper quiet"" setting when we're in that room and I don't even notice them being on. I would definitley recommend the Hamilton Beach air cleaners",0

I had done a lot of research about different brands of knives and felt that the Henckels Pro S series was the best for me. The grip is not cheap and I love the weight of the knife in my hand. And the santoku knife is excellent. I have been using it almost everyday for 4 years. It has replaced my chef's knife as my primary knife and I now use it for simple tasks like cutting up vegetables such as onions and potatoes. And I also use it for more difficult tasks such as cutting up a chicken. This is a great knife that with proper care and sharpening will last for many years",0

They are also very attractive and add enjoyment to all forms of cooking. This particular 4-1/2-Quart Round French Oven is a great size and shape and can be used for a variety of things. It also fits perfectly upon the le Creuset trivet. Other products of similar quality you might try are Global knives and Cuisinart appliances. You won't be disappointed,0
4274,"Why spend Hundreds of Dollars???. I admit I'm a vacuum cleaner fanatic, if there is such thing. But we have  a cat and my wife has asthma. We have had two Dirt Devil bagless vacs for several years. They did a good job but I couldn't stand having to bang the filters to clean them.I did a bit of ""window"" shopping and decided to try this Bissell. It didn't take long to convince me this is a super buy. The amount of material this picked up, even though I had used the Dirt Devils within the past few days, was amazing. I was even motivated to used the attachments and vacuum under the bed!!Emptying is a snap and the dirt cup can then be rinsed off. Great!I can't imagine that a Dyson, for 4-5 times the price, can do any better!I was also surprised at how easy this machine is to maneuver. It just glides around the carpets",0
4275,"Love it!. Granted, it is a bit noisy at first (more like a shocking sound, not so much noisy), but you get used to it.  The mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill, especially if you've never used any of the larger office machines.  This was a complete first for me.  I mixed a few, watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes, but I got the hang of it and love it.  I commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at $2 to $3 a cup, so there's a huge savings in this product.  And the tea is the best I've ever had.  They actually add juice concentrates in the pack (some selections), so the tea is very flavorable.  The machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter, but I think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home.  It will always stick out at first.  I bought black and it looks great.  There really isn't any cleanup at all.  Other machines I looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons.  This really is so simple.  Finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter.  Because the packs are bigger than most pods, it is a challenge.  I ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry.  The round display rack that Flavia offers looks pretty neat.  I will definately buy that.  Over all, it's a perfect product in my opinion",0
4276,"Not a great serving platter. I purchased this item because the description said it would make a great serving platter as well as a casserole.  However, when I received it the sides were definitely too high to make this a platter - it would have looked exactly like I was serving food in a casserole.  It's very durable and looks sharp and might make a great casserole, but I don't recommend it for a serving tray at all",0
4277,"Great Pans, Awful Lids. I bought this set to replace my 17 year old Farberware set because altho' still perfectly fine after all these years, I thought that thicker pans would cook better on my new gas stove. And they do, no doubt about it! Way less splattering and burning, which is what I was hoping for. HOWEVER ... my old pans had domed lids which allowed you to confine the condensation inside by quickly turning them upside down as you lifted them and you could even set them down on the counter this way. The KitchenAid pans have almost flat lids and the liquid usually ends up on the stove. There is no way you can set the lid down anywhere without making a mess. Very nice pans for the money, but I'm not sure I would buy them again",0
4278,"Once you use a Miele, you will never use another. This canister vacuum is perfect for multitasking quickly and easily. I have carpeting, wood, and vinyl floors in my house and used two different vacuums for it. When I bought the Miele, I was able to get rid of the other two cleaners and use this one throughout.It does an incredible job of getting up everything: pet hair, dust, crumbs, little bits of ""stuff"", those nasty dust bunnies and illusive corner cob webs which seem to appear overnight as if by magic (or maybe time to get new glasses!).In one room during a Spring clean, I started at the top - literally! Went from the ceiling and the molding down to the walls - curtains - floors - lamp shades - and everything else in between. All I had to do was change the cleaning head and adjust the suction amount. All simply and quickly done.The fact that it is also fairly quiet was a real bonus. I could actually vacuum while little one was taking his nap ... now THAT is a major plus for any appliance!I know the price is high but you are paying for the quality of the vacuum - an investment if you will. It is very well made and will last for many, many years. I recommend this vacuum highly",0
4279,"Very Pleased With Sugar Please. It took a little getting use to, but once I realized that a teaspoon took three presses instead of two, I was very satisfied with this little gadget.

My issue is probably with the manufacturer, not the store that sold it",0
4281,"Awesome Travel Mug. It's a nice size cup that does a great job insulating.  Cool sliding lid design that is convenient.  My only complaint would be that it's not spill proof, but the lid holds well enough to ""stir"" my coffee by shaking, and hey, they never said it was spill proof.The handle is comfy, and it still fits in my cup holders. (Audi)  It's has a nice lip to drink from, and even the owner of the gourmet coffee store I frequent asked me what kind it was with a Jealous look in her eye.  Very sharp looking.  The lid screws on for both lefty and righty use.  You can pour coffee right up to the top threads.  I usually take the lid off when I get to work, and the smooth metal lip is still very comfy.  (However, you get dribbles on the metal...)I found mine on closeout at Target for $4, and now I'm going to pay $20 for another one.  Yeah, I like it alot.  As an older seasoned caffeine addict, I have gone through my share of various travel mugs, and I'm getting a second one of these before they stop making them.  (Eh, maybe the wife can borrow it.)

4284,"Not an expert, but very pleased anyway!. Reading some of the other reviews makes me believe that I'm probably the least experienced in sharpening tools.  I'm just a home cook; not a professional or expert.  But I found this product extremely easy to use and I have to say, it took my most damaged knife and put it razor sharp in no time at all.  The instructions are easy to follow.  If I have one (very minor) concern, it would be the plastic handle.  It catches when I try to rotate it open and I'm afraid it might break fairly easy.  I just leave it open all the time.  Other than that - I would recommend this sharpener absolutely",0

4286,handy and versatile. I received this as a Christmas gift.  I've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane.  I had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles.

4290,"Best one out there. If you are a serious cook this is the tenderizer you have been looking for.  My first tenderizer was the ""hammer"" type tenderizer.  It did an honest job tenderizing the meat along with your knuckles!  For obvious reasons, I did not enjoy working with this particular model.My second tenderizer was the ""stamper"" style.  Again, it did an honest job but my hand would slip down on the handle and I would begin tenderizing my hand.My last attempt at procuring a tenderizer I could live with is this particular model.  I love the offset handle....no more sore knuckles or hand.   The weight is fantastic!  Basically, you just let the weight of the tenderizer do most of the work for you.  Your job is just guide the plate to it's intended target.  The surface of the tenderizing plate lets you cover a wider area than the ""hammer or stamper"" style.  Thus reducing your time in half.Clean up is easy, either wash by hand or place in the dish washer.  So, what's not to like?",0
4291,sturdy and useful for bagel lovers. Perhaps I appreciate this invention because several years ago I had to go to the emergency room because I had cut myself while cutting a bagel.  It turns out that ER-via-bagel is one of the more common occurrences.  The thing is sturdy and would easily work for a small bagel/bakery stand.  Kudos to its inventor(s),0
4292,"Food Seems To Cut Itself. I think this knife doesn't actually cut the food, so much as it intimidates it. The food looks up, sees this massive, wickedly sharp blade approaching, and leaps out of the way at the last possible moment. That's my best guess as to how this knife cuts so effortlessly.Or I guess it could be the fact that blade takes and holds an edge like a dream, allowing the significant weight of this very large knife to just drop the blade through whatever you happen to put under it. Whatever. The bottom line is you don't have to exert any effort to cut - you basically just steer, and the knife does all the work. Which is exactly as it should be.I've had this knife for about 6 months, and use it almost daily, primarily for cutting up fruits such as pineapple, watermelon, large papayas, peaches, etc. Cutting the rind off a pineapple does require a tiny bit of effort, but otherwise, even a good size watermelon cleaves itself out of the way when it sees this beastie coming.The wide blade is great for transferring food from the cutting board. Plus it adds that much extra weight, allowing the knife to do that much more of the work for you. I also find the width makes it easier to keep the blade against the fingers of my guiding hand, which makes me feel safer/more confident.The length enables you to cut through small watermelons, large papayas and personal size pizzas with just one stroke. Sweet! The length also means that much more curve, meaning you can cut more and larger items without lifting the tip off the board. Also sweet!If had one tiny complaint, it's that the length means the tip of the knife is quite far from your hand, so delicate strokes with the tip, e.g. to cut a blemish out of a piece of fruit, are a little awkward. I've gotten used to it, but it's taken some practice. However, since a 10"" wide body knife isn't primarily designed for delicate tip work, I certainly won't deduct for that.I have a Furi TechEdge Pro Knife Sharpening System. It's a great system, which I love to use. But I've only had to hone this knife's edge 2 or maybe 3 times in 6 months of almost daily use. Granted, I'm only cutting fruits and vegetables on a good quality bamboo cutting board. Still, that's pretty good edge-holding.You really shouldn't buy a knife of this size, or in this price range, without at least holding it. How a particular knife will feel in your hand is unpredictable, particularly one this large and weighty. But I already knew I liked the Wsthof Classic line, so I took a chance and bought this from Amazon without ever holding it. And I'm very glad I have it. I love this knife",0

Popped off like a dream.If you are in the market, might as well get the item that does it all instead of just opening cans, for example",0
4295,"Great Ice Cream maker... This is my first ice cream maker and this one exceeds my expectations. It makes great tasting ice cream and with the 6 qt capacity you can add lots of extras to your ice cream. Unit is built to last, nothing on it is plastic.

4308,"Excellent for everyday. I bought these wine glasses so that I could have lead-free crystal for everyday use. While they don't have the ""heavy"" crystal quality (for example, like Lenox Tuscany), they have good clarity, a pleasantly delicate construction and a nice ""crystal"" ring to them. The ""art deco"" stems are not my favorite (style-wise), but this line was the only lead-free Riedel set to offer ""Vinum"" bowls at the time I bought it.

4313,"Very Handy. It's funny, the different experiences people have with the same products. Now, this review is for the Blender Express, not the ""Plus."" The only difference is the attachments. My wife picked up a couple of these at Wally World after Christmas (2005). They were in a clearance cart for 5 bucks each. I figured that they were probably pretty cheap and I'd have a backup after I burned the first one up. Well, a little over a year later, I'm still using the first one. I use it 3-4 times a week for smoothies and frozen coffee drinks. I have to say that I really abuse the little guy. My coffee drinks call for half of the mug to be filled with crushed ice.It will make these drinks with a minimum of ""crunchy"" ice particles and they are quite enjoyable. I never expected it to last this long because, truthfully, from day one, I have been able to notice the ""burned wire"" odor coming from the unit as I continuosly overload the mug. Yet, it is still chugging along. Even at the full price, a year of this type of useage certainly makes it a good value. And, cleanup is extremely easy and the ""make it and run"" mug is really handy. Of course, for larger quantities, I fall back on the larger blender. If I ever do wear out both of these units, I would not hesitate to purchase another.",0
4314,Great sheets!. I am very happy with the quality of these sheets.  They are soft and warm and fit the bed perfectly,0
4315,"Indestructable!. These are without question the greatest spatulas ever!  Over the years I have thrown away plenty of spatulas usually because they deteriorate quickly and start to leave traces of white rubber behind.

4322,I love this machine!. I have had a blast with this machine since it came out of the box!  It is remarkably easy to use and the results have been wonderful.,0

4325,"Good Vacuum; Great Bargain. No, these do not come with the accessories, but they are good vacuums.  I purchased a Eureka 5856 a year ago, which is virtually identical to these 5860's, except for the color (yellow instead of maroon).  It is the best vacuum I have ever had.  It is really good at picking up pet hair.  After a year of use it performs like it was brand new.These refurbished vacuums show signs that they have been used - on the wheels, and scratchs here and there, but they are cleaned up, the filters are new, the brush is spotless.  You really can't go wrong, since they come with a one year warranty.  Replacement filters for these vacuums are almost half the cost of this refurbished 5680.You have to put the handle on, which is easily done by two phillips screws.The vacuum comes with extension devices for getting into hard to reach places, and a replacement belt.",0
4326,Outstanding. I own a considerable amount of Fiesta.  I originally purchased it 3 years ago because I wanted durable dishes that could be added to and allow for creativity.  I love all the colors and Fiesta has been around since the 1930's so I know I won't have any problems with replacement should any ever actually break.  All vitrified china has factory flaws.  Fiesta does not allow its first quality pieces to have more than 12 flaws.  There are seconds on e-bay.  Purchases made on e-bay should be made with caution because many of these piece are second quality sold as firsts.  I learned the hard way.  If you want china for everyday use that can be added to or easily replaced than I strongly encourage you to buy Fiesta.  If you change your dishware frequently then you might want to buy something cheaper that isn't meant to last.,0
4327,Wilton Cupcakes N' More display. great product.  Perfect for my daughter's birthday party and a big hit at the school parties as well.  a really neat idea,0
4328,"Great Vacuum!  Great Price!. I have had 2 Oreck vacuums in the past 10 years.  I liked them because they were light weight & I thought they were doing a good job.  I'm not sure why I felt the need for another vacuum, maybe because the carpets still didn't look that great after I cleaned, but I began researching upright vacuums and finally settled on this Bissell Total Floors Bagless which cost half of what I paid for each of the Oreck's.  It arrived last week & I was totally amazed by the amount of dirt and pet hair that it picked up only a day after using the Oreck!!!!  I have one pet, a short haired cat and no children, so my house should not have gotten that dirty in one day!  It had to be the vacuum.  I also love the little Turbo brush for cleaning the upholstery.  Does a great job!  I'm so pleased that I decided to buy it.  It is quite a bit heavier that the Oreck, but other than that, it's far superior in my opinion",0
4329,"great deal!. I ordered this sheet set mainly for the price, but also because I was curious about the microfiber material.  After about a month of use, I have no complaints.  It's lightweight and the microfiber feels great when sleeping.  I would definitely recommend this to others",0
4330,It Really Works!. I took my knives to Chesapeake Knife & Tool to have them sharpened and they destroyed the edge. I saw that Cooks Illustrated recommended Chef's Choice sharpeners and decided to give it a try. It took about an hour but I was able to restore the edge and now my knives are just like new.,0
4331,"Excellent Showerhead! Great for people with lousy water pressure. I recently moved to an older rental. It even has an old fashioned fuse box.  The water pressure here is horrible. I thought I'd have to join a health club to get a decent shower... but this little showerhead is somehow able to turn the weak water pressure into a wonderful skin smacking shower! I mean, the water really blasts (I also took out the water saver device, but that did not help when I did that with other showerheads).As for the filtration... it is excellent.  I have been using this product with good results, but only recently with their showerhead.I used to have red and itchy skin on my back and stomach.. but not since I started using this product",0
4332,"I LOVE IT!. This is by far my favorite pan. I use it to cook everything in. Nothing sticks to it what so ever and I love the sleekness to it. It's very durable and versatile. You can use it for sauces, noodle, stir fry, and everything else! I would never buy a pan not made by T-Fal. They're the best",0
4333,"Great pizzelle maker!. I've had this iron for several weeks and am very happy with it. The iron heats quickly and makes crisp pizzelle. Despite the manufacturer's claim that you do not need to oil the cooking surface, I've had to add a bit of oil to the top and bottom plates prior to cooking the pizzelle to prevent sticking. Other than that, it is a good iron for the money",0
4334,"They REALLY do work. Bought these not too long ago. I use them all of the time. They do a great job on towels, men's under clothing, permanent press clothing, cleaning rags (not microfiber, Never soften those), etc. I find the drying time is a little less, the clothes do not tangle and they smell nice and clean. Best of all---no chemicals. If you have clothes with a lot of static cling, then you can throw in maybe half a dryer sheet to reduce that problem. I love these ""little guys"". Recommend them to all and especially chemically sensitive folks",0
4335,"Useful, sturdy, and stylish. Great way to eliminate the necessity for Pam and other unhealthy kitchen sprays.  This oil sprayer is not only very sturdy and well-made, but very aesthetically pleasing to boot.  There's not much to say other than that, as it's merely an oil sprayer.  I recommend it though",0
4336,"LOVE THAT CART!. These carts and shelving units are the best I've ever seen. They are flexible in shelf height, a minimum of one inch between, and it is very easy to reposition shelves after months of use... I have several shelf units and two carts and I plan on purchasing more. For those of you unfamiliar, not a better purchase can be made. Some units even come with wheels for even more flexibility.",0
4337,"Finally, a good dispenser. I've tried so many syrup dispensers all of which dripped, and often the flow mechanism would get stuck.  This one is the first which has neither problem.  It looks quite nice too.  Wish it were a little bigger",0
4338,"Makes Ironing a Breeze. I just got this iron yesterday at Linens & Things using their standard 20% coupon you find all the time in the newspaper. I tried it out on a cotton shirt and got the job down about five times faster than usual, less work, and no wrinkles. The shirt looked like I got it back from the cleaners. I also have an Elna ironpress, which also saves time, but I think I will prefer using the Rowenta steam iron since it steams the material while you iron it, and it can get into more nooks and crannies. Note to Rowenta Engineers -- it would be nice if the water tank had a level indicator to let you know how much water is in it. This would help when you fill it so as to prevent overfilling. Another option would be a removable water tank you could take over to the sink to fill. Also, if this is a typical high quality Rowenta product, why only a one-year warranty? Why not five or ten years",0

4341,"Exceptionally high quality - perfect release. I have used these for making florentine cookies which are extremely sticky, having used disposable mini aluminum pans in the past. They work perfectly, releasing the florentines immediately. Just ordered two more pans, and the price went down, too",0
4342,"Hot and stylish. If you are looking for a mug that keeps your coffee HOT all morning then this is the mug for you!  The top easily unscrews and aligns perfectly once screwed on to use the side handle.  The base is slip-proof, so if it's sitting on your desk and you knock into it, it's not going anywhere.  Besides all of it's great features it's also very stylish and well designed!!",0
4343,"works great. I haven't used the dryer since I got this.  It holds a little less than a full load, but I have an extra large front loading washer.  I may get a second one.",0
4344,"Fun glasses. I love Riedel glasses and these are no exception.  These are great for casual wine drinking ~week day dinners or just a couple of friends drinking and chatting.Sure they don't have a stem, but I rarely hold the glass in my hand the entire time I have a glass of wine so the wine doesn't heat up anyway. Elegant but durable, they fit in the dishwasher. And they are spill proof.If I set a fancy table, I still turn to my beautiful stemmed wine glasses.",0
4345,"Awesome little vacuum with lots of power. I was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum.  Wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction.  It had some of the best section power I had seen in any vacuum.  So I bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities.  Its so light...about nine  pounds and easy to transport and store.  Its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button.  The bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum.  They are very easy to get at and change.  Its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors, along baseboards and on stairways.  Not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch.  I have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming.  This is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright.  My vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool.  Many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too.  I am glad I bought it and would recommend it.  Its the vacuum I would use most.  The biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done.  Push a button and the cord automatically rewinds.  Whats not to like about this vacuum.  Highly recommended",0
4346,Very Usefull. Very useful for storing my multiple journals.  Spray painted easily so now it matches my decor. Using in my home yet planning to add to my office as well.  A good value,0
4347,"A Decent Fan For The Money. This fan does blow a really good stream of wind, even at it's lowest setting, although it does so a bit noisely.  It's somewhat annoying at night, in one's bedroom, when the fan's noise is a bit intrusive.  It sounds sort of like a propellor driven airplane revving up for take-off, although not nearly as loud.  I've got another 16"" floor standing fan several years old that also blows well, although not quite as brisk as the Honeywell, but is a good bit quieter.  I think that the low speed setting on the Honeywell HS-300 is somewhat higher than other fans, hence the noise.  The fan's blade design, which is supposed to increase air flow, is also a contributing factor in making this fan noisier than others, I believe.One negative point is regarding the fan's oscillation feature; there's no button for it on the remote control.  One has to pull/push a button on top of the fan housing to activate or deactivate it.While the noise factor is a slight issue, it's not severe enough to cause me to return this fan.......it does move air around quite well.  And, I did get this fan for a decent price directly from Amazon, $34.00, and no shipping charge with Super Saver.  Sadly, at the time of writing this review, the fan is only available from another company for $40.00 with a shipping charge of $17.46(yikes!!!)",0
4348,"Excellent. This Kettle is really quiet compared to the last kettle I had which was a Krups, and sounded like a tractor.  For the first couple of weeks I found there was a plastic smell when the kettle boiled but it wears off after a while.  It looks great",0
4349,"GREAT TOAST!. This toaster does a perfect job at it's unique requirement-to make great toast.  The wide range on the light to dark dials (1-9) gets it just right for everyone.  It has been nice to move up from a two-slot to four-slot with the addition of kids and not spend all of breakfast processing bread through the toaster.  The bagel feature really works.  It looks very handsome on the counter, but it is large - as large as some small toaster ovens, so measure first.  The only thing that hasn't fit well are long slices from a round of sourdough, I just cut them in half and it was fine.  It has been so nice to have toast that is perfectly done on the entire surface of both sides of the bread!",0
4350,"Works Great, No Problems. I weigh flour for waffles and bread to a tenth of an ounce. As for the on-off-tare switch, it could be a little frustrating if you got one that's too touchy but mine works fine.No regrets",0
4351,"A delight to use. I love this grinder. It's very easy on the hands, grinds consistently and plentifully (I don't seem to have the problems some others have had with the output), lets me have salt and pepper right at hand in one container, and looks good (I have the stainless model).I'm here to buy another one for a friend right now..",0
4352,"Cute. My son loves his new ducky shower curtain.  The ducks are large and fluffy.  The curtain does need a good ironing and the fabric is slightly thinner than I had anticipated.  However, it is still a nice curtain",0

4354,"Extemely Large. This set is a great value. You can turn the sofa into a twin size bed, if you wanted to sleep outside. This is a true deep seating set. It even comes with cushions",0
4355,"Spiegelau will work just fine. Spiegelau was acquired by Riedel a year or two ago, and is quite similar to the Riedel Vinum glassware, which sits just below Riedel's high end sommelier series. These glasses offer exceptional value. The difference between the Spiegelau and the Riedel is less in the quality of any individual stems--both are well-made, European machine blown crystal--than in the fact that Riedel offers a broader range of glassware specifically designed to enhance wines from particular varietals (e.g., cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir) or from particular appellations (e.g., Burgundy, Bordeaux). If you are simply looking for a basic red wine glass and a basic white wine glass, the Spiegelau will work just fine. However, if you usually just drink Barolo, for example, you might wish to invest a bit more money in a Riedel stem specifically developed to enhance the bouquet and flavors of that appellation. However, the most important thing to know is that these are excellent quality glassware that offer the major advantages of crystal over regular glass, a thin lip and a microscopic pores in the glass that effectively increase surface area, increasing the area from which the bouquet can launch.",0
4356,"We eat 3 times more rice now!. This is the Rolls Royce of rice cookers. Excitement is what you'll feel when you open this box. Anybody who intends to eat healthy would love this for gift! Big for families, but cooks half a cup of rice for a single serving just as well. Too many benefits to this wonderful machine. Most of all, easy to clean. It's a little overpriced, but once you get over that life becomes easier, especially if you want to save money. Rice comes out perfect every time. The timer on it lets you know precisely when it going to be done. This is convenient to let you know when to start putting teriayaki strips on the grill, or cooking chicken so they come off at the same time. It fun to experiment with various settings...I prefer the Japanese rice soft setting. Keeps rice hot for days. Don't waste your time shopping all the ""asian stores""...they all cost the same there or more. You know if you get yours from Amazon..it hasn't been sitting on a retail shelf of a year.",0
4357,"Very pretty design. Though these are a little heavy... they are extremely versatile. Looks great in the kitchen and well as on the dining table, if you want to serve in them. One note of caution, the yellow is lighter than in the picture shown.. it has more of a hint of light greenish yellow, but nevertheless looks wonderful",0
4358,"Just what I have been looking for!!!. I have had the more well-known travel mugs, and thought that they were the best.  Well, I was wrong.  This travel mug is by far the best out there.  It is truly leak-proof.  My friends get tired of me turning it upside down (I guess I'm easily amused hehe), but I really do like a mug that won't spill if tipped over.  When turned to the drink side, the liquid flows at about the right rate, not too fast, not too slow.  Anyway, I can't say enough about this mug, and the price also beats the competition.  I am not sure about the red color.  I have the blue and the black, and I prefer the black out of the three choices",0
4359,"An old friend. For many years I had a Presto pressure cooker, but when the sealing ring didn't work a few years back I tossed it out thinking I could never get a replacement ring.  I missed having that pot.  I'm glad to have one once again.  Stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one, but tonight will be spare ribs.  The new pot is nothing like my 30 year old one.  It works the same in the end, though.  I would have opted for the aluminum as that was what I had, but my husband bought the stainless steel.  I don't think it makes a difference for the price, except in appearance",0
4360,Bar-B-Chef review by poebaitfly. The grill is a significant improvement over my previous Weber in regards to:-grill area-regidity of the cast iron grill-control for raising or lowering goals-large charcoal shelf-three compartments within the charcoal shelf-heavy guage metal construction-the option of adding a rotisserieThe grill is wanting in regards to:-lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill-lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals,0
4361,"6 Stars Out Of 5. The other reviewers have said it all, but here's my take on this very affordable (I got mine from a local well known chain store for $3.00 less than A'.com's affiliate offers it for) to replace an old entry level Swing-A-Way that had seen better days.This unit is designed with the usual top gear wheel turned by the handle, BUT has incorporated a SECOND GEAR WHEEL for the can underlid rim advance wheel that meshes with the top gear wheel making for truly EFFORTLESS can opening.My $18.00 Rival Xtra-Tall electric can opener was JAMMING on the large 34.5 oz solid lid coffee cans, but THIS Swing-A-Way had NO TROUBLE with these cans opening them with great ease.BUY THIS ONE and let the others--including the ""side openers"" (a fad that I feel will fade quickly)--gather dust on the shelves.  Swing-A-Way--in this configuration--is the BEST!!",0
4362,"great vacuum. This vacuum is wonderful.  Easy to push and pull.  Neat brush spinning hose attachment, plus many more.  Cleans carpet by just going over them once.  Works on tile too!  Just a great vacuum",0
4363,"Quite operation, but what ever you do don't loose the instructions!. Ok, this is a nice feeder.  I like it better then our last that sounded like it was grinding gravel.  However, holy cow, what ever you do DON'T LOOSE THE INSTRUCTIONS.  Programming the thing requires the most counter-intuitive convoluted set of steps that make no sense at all and are completely illogical.  You will NEVER figure it out for yourself.  It is so retarded, even if you figure it out one time, forget it, you will never remember and be able to do it again.  Who programs this stuff???",0
4364,"Great Kitchen Knife. This was the first Global knife I owned and it is the most used in my collection.  I find it has great balance, an excellently sharpened blade, and a nice shape for dicing.  One of the things that I was originally apprehensive about when I bought this knife was Amazon's description of this being for small-handed individuals (as I am six foot and of average build).  I have no problems handling this knife.It's a little more slippery than, say, the Chicago Cutlery knives I have with wooden handles, but the trade off is that it's easier to clean (don't put it in the dishwasher) and looks a lot cooler.   If you're serious about cooking, and have the coin to upgrade, I would go with Global's heavier line.These knives are a little more difficult to sharpen than most knives I've had (especially this one with its curved blade).  The manufacturer says to use a waterstone, which I have, but I tend to use my electric sharpener which does the job nicely.Since I've bought this knife, I've acquired the Chef's knife, vegetable knife, and the paring knife from this collection and I am happy with all of them",0
4365,"great product, expensive but worth it. my cat only drinks from water thats running, siamese geez. he wasnt peachy with it at first, but after about a day or so, he realised that i wasnt going to give him water from the sink anymore and switched. but i had to keep up with the reinforcement of not giving him water from the bathroom sink. when he wanted to get water and meowed, i would take him over to the waterfall and petting him lovingly. i put the fountain in a seclueded corner so nothing is able to distract him or sneak up or frighten him.",0

4370,"Nice idea for spices. This spice rack works great in a drawer. It is a simple design, basically just a thick piece of plastic bent to make the spices lay on an angle. I reused my square Target spices with new labels -- it's beautiful! The spices are tucked in a drawer next to my stove so they are easy access while keeping my kitchen uncluttered.It was reasonably easy to install -- my drawer isn't as long as the rack so I had to get out my handsaw and cut it down a bit. It suggests this in the directions. Unfortunately, the rack wasn't cut squarely -- so I also had to get out my sander and sand down part of a side -- it was about a 1/16"" off and wouldn't fit into the drawer. But after I did that, it fit very snugly and now works well.",0
4371,"We love this coffee maker!. After trying a different DeLonghi model and not being pleased (the thermal pot did not keep the coffee warm and it spilled coffee on the counters while brewing), we tried this model at my sister-in-law's request (she purchased this model about 8 months ago) and we LOVE it! The coffee stays hot and is easy to use. My husband and I would recommend this model to everyone",0
4372,"Good value and not bad looking either. My old coffee table was about to collapse, so I decided I needed a new one. After looking around, and finding a lot outside of my price range I stumbled across this one, at a very reasonable price. How could I go wrong? The table itself is surprisingly solid (and has no scratches btw), and although the legs need attaching (by the normal bolt to bracket type) they also seem solid, because it uses 2 bolts per leg. THis was why my last table did not last, so I'm pleased to see the extra strength this will provide. The table also looks pretty good. The dark wood is elegant, and although the little chrome pieces seem a bit cheap and tacky, they are actually hidden away, so that unless you're lying on the floor, you really wouldn't notice them at all.",0
4373,"Don't buy these!!!!. I am disgusted with the quality of this item! I understand it is inexpensive, but the sheets snagged after one usage ( and I wear satin pajamas there is nothing to snag on!)  After one wash they were unusable!!!  The quality is horredous!

4377,"Mr Heater Propane Guage. This product should be labeled as a ""Mr Heater"" propane guage. It does not measure the level of liquid propane in your tank. However, it does measure the ability of the vaporized flow of propane gas to keep up with the usage of your propane appliance. The red, yellow, and green indicator disk on the circular dial makes it easy to see how your propane use is doing before you completely run out. Its debatable if you need to know ""exactly"" how much liquid propane is still in the tank. The vaporization indicator on this guage has been useful for me",0

It does a great job of keeping my daughter's 12x12 foot room warm all night when on low setting (700 watts) and about half on the thermostat setting.    We left it on full blast in the garage for three hours when we first got it, and it definitely gave off an oil smell.   We moved it to the bedroom after that & no smell at all.   It does get a little hot to touch, so not for use around small kids, nor can you put it against draperies or furniture",0

4383,"Sunbird. I have one of these cute space savers.  I like the compact size and it does the toaster and toast over duties as well as the other big monsters.  You can see the bottem half of a piece of toast as it toast so the doneness can be monitored.  Only real complaint I have is that using the level to eject the toast is almost imposible, a considerable amount of pressure is need and the toast goes flying. My granddaughter thinks that is great.  Pulling the plug is the quickest way to eject the toast, and by the way was the manufactures' suggestion when I called to complain.  I also have a regular toaster and pulling the plug is the only way to get bread out early.  The oven does an excellant job of toasting my French rolls and Toastation is so compact I am going to buy another for my winter home",0

4385,"Works but does it affect the taste??. As a vintner we remove the CO2 from the wine as part of our process.  This device uses CO2 to ""pop"" the cork--very clever.  However this minor introduction of CO2 is insignificant and will vent quickly.  At times there is an off-taste --like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine. Let it breath for a while -- 5 minutes or so and it seems OK.This device works well on corks, but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics.  Do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective.REW",0

This lamp, as most lamps, is not made for grabbing and moving too much. Put it where you want it and enjoy it's beauty! Buying this lamp is a win-win situation",0

Also, there was almost no learning curve-- my first cup (surprisingly, from what I've read elsewhere) was near perfect, and apparently it wasn't a fluke.If there is ANY drawback, it's only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe (but I'm sure a purist would scoff at such a notion).If I have one recommendation, it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe (or whatever it's called) to steam your milk. I'm not a physicist so I'm not sure why, but it does make a difference.In summation, this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice. (I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have to grind the beans, and it didn't include an intravenous unit)",0
4390,Working for over 2 years. I have had this unit for over 2 years and everything still works just as good as the day I bought it.

4391,"Two polyactyl thumbs up for Cosequin!. My cat Mira, a 5 year old polydactyl tabby, was diagnosed with hip dysplasia several months ago.  She'd never been a big leaper (never leapt onto my kitchen counters!), but when she wouldn't jump onto my bed, or even sit up for a little bite of tuna, I knew she was in trouble.  X-rays showed hip dysplasia.  Her vet put her on a short regimen of prednisone, plus daily supplements of Cosequin (1 pill per day).  After two weeks, I was able to discontinue the prednisone.  That left her with just the Cosequin, which her vet recommended should remain a permanent supplement to her diet.I'm happy to report that since she's been off the prednisone, eating food supplemented once daily with the Cosequin, she's been her old self again!  She leaps easily onto my bed, and sits up for treats.  I'm VERY happy with the results of this supplement -- and so's she.  Two polyactyl thumbs up for Cosequin",0
4392,"Nice presentation... I don't drink tequila normally. But, I bought these as a gift for a friend who does. He paid me back by pouring me a `generous' glass of Patron Silver. Now, while I don't drink tequila, I do appreciate all fine liquors. So my first impression of these glasses was ""fragile"". I drink wine often and like a heavier glass, as I am sometimes clumsy. Though, these glasses did seem to be of high quality. They showed the clarity and color of the tequila nicely. They also allowed me to appreciate the aroma of the spirit without being overwhelmed by it. It was more of a sipping glass, but was shaped so that if you wanted to shoot it you could. I believe it did make the experience more enjoyable. It brought out taste and smell that I would not have normally smelled from tequila in a shot glass. So, if you appreciate fine tequila and think putting a $60 bottle of anything into a shot glass is a sin, I would recommend this for you. If/when I finish a wet bar in my home with nice liquors I will buy a set of these for myself for those special occasions when I entertain more sophisticated tequila drinkers.",0

Not only did the refund charges, we spoke as late as this week and my sole purchase was well over a month ago.  If I receive this service from a one-time purchase, can you imagine what a repeat customer gets.  Your Lowest Price Store is just that!!!

4395,"a very very good BIG knife. This is the knife I find myself reaching for most often while working in my kitchen.  Why?  1) it feels right in the hand, it is well ballanced and the grip fits my admitedly beefy hands quite well.   2)The excellent ballance makes it feel like a smaller knife in my hand, that is to say I have no touble using it even for semi-precission tasks.  This makes it very versitile and I don't find myself switching knives for every task. 3) I find that a few passes across the diamond steel brings the blade up to razor sharp.  Once honed on the diamond steel I can prepare meals for hours with only the occasional pass across the diamond steel to maintain the edge.All this said, I will say that the high carbon content of the Henckels knife makes the blade quite hard and if you let the edge go entirely, you will need to find a professional to return the knife to razor sharpness as doing it yourself is very difficult.A side note: I do not use a ""regular steel"" with any or my knives.  They are not really intended to ""sharpen"" a knife but rather to straighten the edge.  The diamond steel will give thes knife back its edge and does so quickly and rather gently at that",0

4408,top notch humidifier. I also purchased the Air-O-Swiss 7135 after first buying the Vent Sonic which appeared to be a knock off of another Air-O-Swiss model 7133 that Bed Bath and Beyond no longer carries. The AOS eloctronic humidifier is more than I needed but the cheaper manual (knobs) wasn't available. I thought the Venta Sonic was in fact the manual model of the AOS and bought it as it looked similar to the pictures of the 7133 model. When i opened the package I realized right away that this was not worth $99 and reading through the one page instructions found that it was not the AOS. It is pretty cheaply made and did not generate much mist and the fan could barely get the mist more than a foot from the nozzle. A big problem was that the Vent Sonic unit splashed so much water under the container that water leaked out between the base and the container leaving a puddle in just 30 minutes. I took the Venta Sonic back and bought the AOS 7135 which has an electronic buttons to regulate the fan and moisture. What is great is that you can set the percentage humidity and the unit will reach that amount and stop sending mist. It also shows the current humidity level. Since the main purpose of a humidifier is to add humidity to the air but not make it like a rain forest the electronic info is very usefull. The AOS 7135 works like a dream even though it is pretty pricey but a full nights sleep every night is worth an awful lot. It is extremely wel made and designed. While it is $149 there are discounts available from BB&B for 20%,0

4410,"Better than Expected. I received this coffeemaker as a Christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket-style filter.  After using the maker for a week, I have to say my skepticism was unjustified.  This machine makes great-tasting coffee that is as hot as I could want it.  I never liked the ""cooked"" coffee that regular, glass-carafe makers produced - burned tasting after the first cup.  The coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last.  I fill the carafe with hot water, mill my beans and fill the reservoir, empty the carafe and enjoy.  After two hours, the coffee was still hot.  One great feature not highlighted is the front-fill aspect:  Kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front, right next to the filter.  No more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level.  Extremely convenient.I have to disagree with the previous reviewer - this machine makes ten 5-ounce cups.  After reading the review, I double-checked the carafe capacity against my old Krups machine:  exactly 10 cups; more than enough for our household.  All in all, a great-looking, great-performing coffeemaker that meets Kitchenaid's high standards.  I highly recommend it",0

4418,"Some Things to Consider Before Purchasing. Given the reviews posted earlier, I approached this machine with some trepidation, expecting difficult operation, inconvenient clean-up, and poor juice.  I am pleased to say that none of this occurred.  I have had my juicer for 2 weeks now, have pressed over 5lbs. of oranges, and enjoyed a gallon of gloriously fresh juice.  It was easy to squeeze and easy to clean-up.  However, consider the following points before puchasing.1. You absolutely must have some upperbody strength to exert the required force and control the lever action.  While my wife had a bit more difficulty, she was able to squeeze the oranges just fine.  Also, operation may not be comfortable for left-handed individuals, as the lever is on the right-side of the machine and your free (left) hand must rest on the top of the unit to prevent excessive force from jolting the machine.2. When rotating the lever, do so SLOWLY, as rapid motion can lead to spraying juice from the orange, loss of control of the unit, or both.3. Do not use the machine for 1 glass of juice.  You'll spend less time and effort using a simple plastic pulper over a glass.4. Do not use this machine for 1 gallon of juice or more.  If you're making that much juice, consider an industrial automatic model ($2000 and up), or just get used to that juice out of the carton.5. Be sure to read the directions before using.  It really helps to know how all four removable pieces attach/detach when cleaning up.  Clean up is as simple as rinsing/wiping with a sponge and replacing into machine.  Really takes no more than 15 seconds.6. Leave the machine on your counter if possible.  Your lower back will thank you.7. Purchase good quality juicing oranges.  After buying oranges of several varieties from different purveyors, you'll be amazed at the differences in flavor.  All oranges are not created equal!8. Before pressing your oranges, give them a few seconds (10) in the microwave.  This will result in more free flowing juice during pressing.9. Some reviewers have mentioned that pressing the oranges releases some of the volatile oils found in the rind into the juice.  While this is true, these oils give oranges their distinctive aroma and taste, and therefore improve the quality of the juice and provide some bracing acidity to its sweetness.10. The imperfect shape of the upper and lower press molds doesn't extract all of the juice from the outer edges of the orange half.  We addressed this by simply moving the orange edges over the lower mold and repressing - a few more precious drops!11. Will not extract as much juice per orange as an electric machine with a rotary pulper, but requires less cumulative effort when doing more than a few oranges.I cannot comment about the durability of the unit as I have only used it for several weeks.  However, it is difficult to believe that avoiding overtorque using slow deliberate lever motion wouldn't reduce the probability of any cracking in the cast-iron.In summary, this machine provides great value for the niche it was intended to serve - fresh juice enthusiasts squeezing a quart or more of juice per week (but not more than 2 gallons!)with an eye for sharp design.",0
4419,"An Essential for Family of Four or More. This is a big saucepan!  I got it for Christmas because I needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines.

The only problems I have are 1. that the hose does not stretch very far from the vacuum and 2. The hose does pop out every once in a while and I don't notice it until cat hair and debris is flying around the air instead of being deposited into the canister.  Other than these two issues, I have had this vacuum cleaner almost 3 years now and I like it.  The belt broke on it today, but this is the first time.  It has exceptional sucking power and the power spinning brush attatchment for the hose is excellent for picking up cat hair from the stairs and couches.

4433,"Great machine for the price. I bought this machine 2 years ago with the thought in mind that even if it worked for a while, we could see how much we would actually use an espresso machine and still not have to spend a lot of money. I worked in a coffee shop and was used to all the perks of a larger machine, but for ""at home"" use, this machine is great. It doesn't make double shots and you can't steam while making the shot or adjust the steam, but for the price, it's been well worth the money. We have used it at least once a week, more often 2 to 3 times a week for 2 years (making 2 to 4 drinks during each session). Just recently I did experience the same problem as described by others where the frother no longer works. I opened the machine up (only one screw on top under lid where you insert water resevoir) and sure enough the hose had come off. Replaced it and it's working again. Just some pointers, I do think it's very important to have the proper grind of coffee (I grind my own). Also important is a proper tamp and no coffee at all around the edge of the filter for a good seal. I even get a great crema. Cleaning of the machine is also important. I clean mine with a good wipe down of the nozzle and filter head after each session used and once in a while with a descaler, running it through the frother, as well as the filter.Maybe I just got lucky with this machine, but we have really enjoyed it and even if it quit working tomorrow, we've still gotten more than our money's worth",0

I have some other nice knives including some Henckels and a high qaulity Japanese Chef knife.  The only reason I didn't give the knife five stars is that it lacks the heft and is not as elegant looking as my other knives, however, it is just as sharp if not SHARPER!  I must admit that I haven't compared it to other boning knives as this is my first boning knife.We'll have to see how it holds up over time, but Victorinox provides a lifetime warranty, so I'm not worried.

4436,"Perfect for beginner and beyond. Whenever you add new tap water to your aquarium the chemistry of the water changes, these changes can be very harmful to the fish depending on how drastic they are. So it's recommended you do a 10-20% water change every week to your aquarium to help reduce chemicals like ammonia and dilute the nitrites etc. But the tap water also carries harmful chlorine and chloramine.Tetra AquaSafe removes both and enhances the stress coat produced by your fish, thus making it perfect to condition your aquarium. I've had no problems whatsoever with it, and it has greatly improved the overall health of my fish.I personally don't use it with every water change (although its recommended that you do) but that's usually based on the amt being added and the condition of my tap water.Use 5ml to treat 10ga",0

It is light and easy to handle, but very sturdy.  I use it mostly in the passenger seat of my car, but wouldn't mind putting it in the back with my adult dog -- something I wouldn't dream of with a hard metal crate.  The one time the puppy upchucked, the cleanup was trivial. The bottom pan is held in place by velcro; it got pulled out in a few seconds and then got hosed down.

4445,"Riedel is the best in fine glassware. I've been using Riedel for years.  (Pronounced ""REEdul"") Their best line is handblown Austrian crystal and is called the ""Sommelier"" series.  VERY expensive, but peerless in quality and beauty.  The next line down is also very fine and is called the ""Vinum"" series.  My white wine glasses are from this series.  My red wine glasses are from the ""Overture"" series -- the Magnum glasses.  These are just the right size -- the Vinum can get quite large.  I also prefer a shorter stem, which these have.  I thought the Overture regular reds were a little too small for my taste (and smell!).Overture is a little more durable, MUCH cheaper, but not quite as elegant.  Still, they are very nice glassware and certainly nice enough to have for fine dining and guests.I would suggest you NEVER put ANY Riedel glassware in the dishwasher.

4451,"Pure luxury!. This is THE blanket!!! I have ordered several of the ""micro-mink"" type blankets, only to return them disappointed, but this one is the keeper, and the best by far!!!  I bought two of these, one for my son's bed and one for ours, and got a throw for the couch!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! You won't be disappointed with the softness, and the weight is slightly heavy, which I personally love.  Great blanket",0

4453,"AVERAGE. JUST GOT THIS, WASHED OK, NO COLOR RUN. THE TOWEL HAS A PRICE TAG OF $13.95 ON IT. I PAID $19.99. WOULD BE A GOOD BUY FOR $13.95. VERY AVERAGE, HAVE TOWELS FOR 10 BUCKS, SAME SIZE, ETC",0
4454,"Well worth the price of admission. I really like this item.  It's simple, but attractively so, and it's a really good deal.  Also, it's sturdy glass...it's got a good heft to it and it's not a shatter waiting to happen.  Think of it as the &quot;everyday&quot; decanter that you can use without fear while you're waiting for the perfect occasion to break out that nice, pricey Waterford job that you got for you wedding",0
4455,"Why didn't  I get one of these earlier?. I just got my Hoover Floormate yesterday and I LOVE it.  Now I don't cringe when my son crawls on the kitchen floors and I don't live in fear of him getting e-coli poisoning.  Now,to be realistic, you can't expect it to do jobs that require elbow grease, like caked on dirt, but it sure makes daily cleanup and maintenance a breeze! What I love is the fact that you don't need to drag out the vaccuum cleaner, mop and bucket, do the labor and then wait for the floor to dry or drag a bathtowel accross the floor.  It is incredibly easy to fill the unit, take it apart and clean it, and put it away.  Also, the older model is very reasonably priced, and I don't think the newer model is worth the extra money for the features.  This unit does the job",0
4456,"Pancakes anyone?. I bought this on a whim after my wife made the most delicious pancake breakfast using a large frying pan, it took what seemed forever having to cook them one at a time. Whith this baby she can make 3 large ones at a time, 2 loads an it's breakfast time! I grilled 6 talapia fillets ont it this evening, they came out great.For those of wondering whether or not it will fit in your dishwasher... it won't! But, with the nonstick coating, just sponge down and rinse while still warm, good as new!As a side note I'm kinda already sick of pancakes, but how can I tell her to stop making them witout her flipping out (pardon the pun)",0
4457,"Classy looking functional collar. I ordered this collar because I didn't like the looks/design of the kitty collars I found in the pet stores.  Also, at the time my kittens (I have two) were only 12 weeks old, so I was looking for a collar that would adjust with their growth.  I'm happy to report that this collar (I ordered two, in different colors) has been great.  Even the vet noticed the collar and remarked how neat it is.  The collar looks really sharp and has a nice sized metal loop for hanging an ID tag, etc. Both kittens took to this collar just fine (it was their first collar) and I have been able to let the collar out a bit as they've grown.  I also like the fact that there's no ""extra collar"" hanging out past the buckle -- the collar just forms a big loop around the kitty's neck.  The only issue I've had is one of the collars is a bit hard to adjust -- but overall I've been very pleased.",0
4458,"Great Crock Pot!. I like this crock pot. I haven't used the little one much, but I'm sure it will come in handy next time I'm serving a warm cheesy dip or melted chocolate. I love that the lid is clear so you can see what's going on in there. The ""keep warm"" feature is nice too, esp. if mealtime is later than you planned. Something kind of odd is that after you wash the crock pot and it dries there's always a white residue on it. I'm not sure what that's all about. But it's a good crock pot.",0

This thing rocks!",0
4461,"We are happy with this purchase. The pitcher retains the beverage temperature well.

4462,"Great Item. I looked all over for a cutting board like this.  I almost didn't buy it because of the negative review on this site but I really needed one so I went ahead with the purchase.  This is an awesome item!  It does stand up to heavy use, you just need to bend the arms slightly to make them stay in place.  An added feature is that the bamboo is water-repellent and very hard.  I would highly recommend this cutting board",0

4465,"Great Tasting Coffee!. Because this coffeemaker was unavailable for a while I was waiting for it with some anticipation. My patience was well rewarded with some fine tasting cups of coffee!It does take a little longer to make coffee than my Mr Coffee machine. The cleanup is a little longer, too. But the difference in taste is worth it. There are limits on the advantages of convenience...However it is important to use a coarse grind of coffee. If the grind is too fine, or if the grind includes too much ""dust"" then the filter will clog. The coffee then never makes the trip down the tube and just sort of sits there, betwixt and between. So just remember to use the right grind and you will be very happy with your Bodum Santos.I also use a Cory glass filter rod instead of the plastic filter included with the Bodum Santos. The plastic one works just fine but the glass filter looks so cool. (The caveat about coarse grind applies to the glass filter rod as well.)Try it! You'll like it",0
4466,"It works. I bought this because it was rated highly by 'america's test kitchen', and it was available for a good price. I have never owned an immersion blender before so I cannot compare to others. The model I bought does not have accessories, but I don't think they are necesary. The reviews I read, mention that this has a strong motor, and the stainless shaft does not stain like plastic. The only problem I have is finding a place to put it when not using it",0

4469,"LOVE it - been using this for 3 years now!. The Bonjour coffee press was mentioned in a magazine (maybe Esquire?) as a top pick and after a little more research, we purchased an 8-cup version.  We (and our dinner guests) loved it so much, we decided to get the 12-cup version.Here's why we like it:1) The container looks really nice on the table.  We get lots of compliments on it.2) We've had it for over 3 years now, use it daily, and haven't had a single problem.  I've read about glass shattering or burning yourself w/other models, but we've been fine.  We often put it in the top rack of our dishwasher on the normal dishwashing cycle, too.3) It's fairly easy to clean, all the parts unscrew if you want to give it a thorough washing.4) As with probably all French presses, we feel like we get more flavor per scoop of coffee.  Delicious coffee!!Here are some tips:1) We grind our coffee at the store on the ""French press"" setting so it's coarser.  We measure the coffee scoops, but not really the water anymore since you get used to just looking at the color of the mixture or how far you normally fill it.  We use a wooden spoon (wooden chopsticks and bbq skewers also work well) to stir the grinds/water mixture - this helps prevent the glass from breaking if you accidentally hit the glass.2) I'd recommend getting this larger 12-cup version.  As mentioned in the product description it comes out to 4-5 mugs of coffee - this is because the ""cups"" they refer to are really teacup sized.  This is true for all brands when they say ""12-cup,"" not just Bonjour.  The larger size gives you flexibility to make a little or a lot depending on your needs.3) You can also use this for steeping tea.  Handy with the loose leaf teas that aren't in bags since you can just press it down at the end",0
4470,"Great Gadget. I have two of these that I got late last year.  They have worked perfectly for four months and I have yet to replace the batteries.   Since it is battery powered it doesn't have cords causing ""counter clutter"". It is also easy to move around.  I have tried lots of storage methods for my coffee beans and this is easily the best",0
4471,"Classic Design. These days most people choose an elegant open-stock stainless steel flatware pattern for both their formal and casual placesettings. This Mikasa Italian Countryside pattern is an enduring classic that matches the Mikasa white stoneware line with the same name, and it also goes well with BIA white porcelain and Mikasa Libretto stoneware placesettings. This four-piece Hostess Set includes a cold meat fork, serving spoon, pierced serving spoon, and gravy ladle. You'll probably want to add some open-stock serving pieces to this set, such as more serving spoons and forks. This flatware has a nice feel, good balance, lovely design, and is made of heavy-duty 18/10 gauge stainless steel. It's dishwasher-safe, and it keeps its gleaming finish for a long time. Many people like to keep their sets of 'good' stainless flatware in wooden chests and use less costly patterns for everyday dining. I've been using Mikasa flatware for more than ten years, and I think it's comparable in every way to Oneida",0

4474,"Does the job!. I got one of these for Christmas and I love it. Great for small jobs (picking up litter, hair, dust). We've even used it in our cars. Charging is convenient, too. No bulky cradle to worry about mounting on the wall, there is just a plug. Also, I was happy to see that replacement filters were available both from Black and Decker AND Amazon should I need them",0
4475,"Excellent!. We love this vaccum!  It works really well, and shows all the disgusting, icky dirt that was collected... which, sadly, never seems to end! If only it would keep the dirt from coming back!  ha ha",0
4476,"I love this!!!  Great gift idea. This makes the best Americano's I have ever had, better than Starbucks!!!!  It takes a few uses to get the pot primed and then you are in business.  The cost of the pot has off set the cost I would have spent at the local coffee shop.  The only complaint I have, if you do not get a good seal when you put the pot together, the gasket sometimes leaks and you have coffee splatering.",0
4477,"Just perfect!. I snatched the last two boxes last night. This works perfect with my tall, rust color, iron headboard and my high mattress. I was afraid they would be too small but they're actually of a decent size for a nightstand. The drawer looked flimsy on the display at the store, but after a quick 15 min assembly at home I could see a pretty sturdy piece of furniture. The drawer looked &amp; worked great.  Best of all, PRICE... something similar would have cost me at least $100 @ Pottery Barn.",0
4478,"Great knives, but watch out lefties!. I agree with all of the accolades given to this paring knife by other reviewers.  It's razor sharp and a work of art.  However, it is designed for a right handed person, which shouldn't be surprising given that it's designed and made in Japan.  As you may have guessed, I'm left-handed.  Most people don't realize how many products are designed for righties and the challenges this presents for lefties.  The asymmetry on this isn't so severe that I won't be able to use it, largely because it is so small.  The ""D"" shape described in the product info isn't quite accurate, there is a ridge running down the right side of the handle, designed to fit in the crease of your hand.  That ridge hits the middle of my thumb when I hold the knife in  my left hand.This knife is great, but I won't be able to get a larger version unless they do away with the  ""D-shaped Pakkawood handle; comfortable offset steel bolster"" or make a left-handed version",0
4479,"Great Milk Frother. I love this product. I purchased a nespresso leCube. I wanted an espresso machine that made great espresso and was a breeze to clean up after. I have had espresso machines before, but I hated cleaning up the milk steamer and such, and I prefer my espresso straight up. So, my use of a milk steamer was occassional. This Aeroccino is perfect. Easy to use, easy to clean. Fill it to the line with milk, choose the attachment to heat the milk or froth it. Push the button. It stops automatically after a minute. Its easy to clean, run it under the faucet, a little dish soap, that it. No mess, no fuss. Highly recommended, especially as an accessory to the Nespresso LeCube",0

The suction cups on the bottom hold the machine firmly in place.  Overall, a great purchase",0

4485,"Best cat toy ever!. This toy is great, it keeps them occupied for hours.  I can not recommend it highly enough.  It can be an interactive toy, you can just put it on the floor and leave them to themselves, or you can mount it to a wall and watch them play with it for hours.  We have gone through quite a few of these with our cats, and they are always an easy gift for friends' cats.  Buy one and see",0

4487,"Hey, jerx- it works!. To be honest, I haven't used it all that much.  It gives off a fair amount of light, though, sort of like a miniature street lamp.  Usually, if my wife gets up in the middle of the night to pee- she's pregnant, so she gets up in the middle of the night to pee a lot- and I happen to be awake, I'll roll over and grab the Mighty Bright and guide her way into the bathroom with it.  It's pretty good for that.  Don't get me wrong- it's good for reading, too, I just haven't done much reading lately.  Maybe I've given up",0

4489,"Good quality and nice looking tank. I purchased this tank 9 months ago and have been fairly happy with it. It looks nice. I love the rounded corners which look much better than the glued glass panes. The acrylic material is still holding up, but I am a lot more careful cleaning it than with glass. The only problem I've had with this unit is a rattling noise that seems to come from the hood. It can be quite for 10 minutes to a couple of days. Then it starts rattling. I adjust the hood and it goes away. Lately, in the last couple of weeks the pump has started with some serious rattling which I can't get rid of. It annoys me and I am sure the fish are even more annoyed. I cleaned the impeller and every surface of the pump, but without luck. So I think I have to go buy a new pump",0

4492,"I give it 4 stars for its handiness... I have not had a chance to use my cereal dispenser, but I do look forward to using it.  I, too, was not very satisfied with the color.  I was expecting a white dispenser, which would have matched my kitchen appliances, and I got the creamish, off white dispenser.  I learned a few techniques from the other reviews on how to use the dispenser to avoid crushing my cereal.  I will check back at a later date and rate how my family and I like it.  I definitely love the idea of not using cereal boxes and having to worry about if my husband or son will close the sack appropriately so the cereal will remain fresh.  That was a definitely plus for me.I guess I will see how things go!!",0
4493,My mini pins favorite thing. First let me say I have tried lots of beds for my dog and she hasnt been jazzed by any of them but this one was a hit out of the ball park!I have this on my bed for her to sleep in it.....That she can cuddle under the top is heaven to a dog who prior to this would try and crawl up my pajamas everynight.  I guess that makes it heaven to me too :)Its nice and soft and cuddly - lots of cushioning....  Its probably the thing I bought for my little Ginger that she actually likes more than I do,0
4494,"Verry Good. Very nice product. Some people complainted about the amount of noise it makes, i really didn't notice that much noise.Maybe i got used to it really quickly or something buuut its really not bothersome.Fridge looks great and can be set VERY cold to possibly be used as a freezer (not sure tho, havnt tried yet). Only complaint is that standard beer bottles dont fit vertically, you have the lie them on their side. but thats really not a big deal.Very happy i bought this.",0

4497,"great at the price. I am very pleased with this product, for the price I paid for it. It is sturdier than I expected, can hold a somewhat surprising amount of laundry (small items on the lower rods, bigger things on the upper), and folds remarkably flat.An optimal dryer might be shaped to make sure rods aren't quite so on top of each other so that things hanging down don't drip onto other things, but that's a small complaint: I repeat, I feel I got an excellent bargain on this drying rack",0
4498,"EXCELLENT product for what it's intended to do. Sadly I bought this item from a link in google that took me to Amazon and didn't list all the sources ON Amazon that sold it.  I ended up paying $15 or so more than necessary for it, since Their price was more than Target's SHIPPED price.  I bought it at Beach Audio, through Amazon for $33.07 with a shipping charge of $14.35, for a final price of $47.42.  Had I realized I should have RE-searched on Amazon for the brand and model number I would have found it from Target at the $25 listed price and shipping under $7!!! A substantial savings.HOWEVER, sad as I am that I could have saved a few of my Social Security bucks, I'm totally amazed at the job this tiny fan is doing for me.  Here's my situation, and though I'm sure yours is quite different, you can see the value of the appliance:I'm a retired person, living upstairs in a tiny living quarters with someone else living downstairs who is in control of the heating and cooling of the house.  During the fall and spring when it's nice outside, the house heat is turned on and migrates upward to become trapped in my tiny living quarters.  If I open a window, the heat goes out and the heating system comes back on to make more, I'm sure this causes their electric bill to skyrocket.  I found that if I become uncomfortable, I can close my door and my air conditioning vent and crack a window for fresh air, allowing the heat transmitted through the floor to warm the room.  This works pretty well, but sometimes not much air comes in the window... and occasional birds and insects to find their way in.The little Honeywell fit one of my windows perfectly and can be set to quietly blow air in and out at the same time, and it's thermostatically controlled so it can hold the room at exactly the temperature I like.  If I want to smoke a cigar or my pipe, I can set it to exhaust through both fans, or to circulate in and out faster, so I don't have to worry about poluting the air throughout the house (be sure the door and a/c vent are closed before doing this, they WILL notice :).The fan blades are plastic, but well enough made so the low setting is not objectionable at all.  I had tried a 20"" box fan to exhaust air before, but that was extremely noisy even at the lowest setting.  The low setting on this one makes no more noise than my computer fan and still moves air so well I immediately feel the fresh air.I paid too much for it, but it's worth twice the price to me.  I'm a happy old man and very pleased with my purchase.  I hope it lasts a long time",0
4499,"Love it. The knives we got for our wedding 7 years ago had become dangerously dull.... no more!

It's great, and my knives are once again nice and sharp",0
4500,"Wok Assistant. If you own a carbon steel wok, you may as well add this spatula to your cooking tools.  It works much better than a long handled metal spoon and is certainly safer than using a standard stainless spatula.  Instead of stirring the food around the pan, the spatula helps to toss the food around and get it up on the sides of the wok.  It also allows you to scoop out more food than a spoon or regular spatula.  I considered purchasing another wok spatula but the handle had an angle that made it appear to be better suited for scooping and flipping burgers on the grill rather than stir frying.  Speaking of handles, the one on this spatula may work itself loose after a few uses.  If this happens, you will need to bang it against a hard surface to reposition it.  I originally gave this 5 stars because I hadn't experienced the handle coming off.  I still think it works pretty good but would rather give it 3 stars",0
4501,"Gr-r-r-r-reat Opener. This wine opener is absolutely amazing!   I bought it after I saw it on one of the morning shows never expecting it to be as good as they said.  However I was totally surprised.  I've tried many different openers and always wound up with cork in the wine or the whole cork pushing down into the bottle.  It works very well on both regular corks and synthetic corks.  I have successfully removed the cork every time I used it, which is fairly often.  I plan on buying a couple for Christmas presents for people who are hard to buy for.  Don't think twice, buy it",0

4503,"Great Fence System. This is a great fence system, very easy to use and set up. Our dogs picked up on it in no time. The collars get good battery life (about 4mo if your dog doesn't need a correction very often) and the design of the wireless system makes it much more difficult for a dog to escape than an underground fence. Power outages are handled well. A sudden loss of signal doesn't issue a correction to the pet. This only occurs with the gradual reduction in signal strength as the animal moves out of range of the transmitter. Fluffy won't get zapped if the lights go out.My only small complaint is that I wish I could still purchase the original collar that shipped with this unit when it first came out. I know the newer collars are supposed to be better, but the original ones used a much easier to find and inexpensive battery",0

But let's face it: a lot of the coffee you will drink for the rest of your life will be average or below. That is where this mug comes in. Originally designed for diners and other cheap restaurants, this mug has history and tradition behind it. Virtually any coffee will taste better in this mug. The color is right -- off-white. The shape is right -- love those slightly concave sides. And the heft, the weight, is perfect. You won't be knocking this puppy over easily. Get six of these so that you always have one clean in your cupboard. Oh, and if you are a tea drinker also (like me), don't even think of drinking tea from one of these.

Any negative reviews have to be biased by some very isolated situation.  We have used both the griddle and the panini/grill.  It makes absolutely wonderful burgers, chicken, sausages and sandwiches.

I have looked at machines with built in chiller compressors in the past but they have always been out of the price range that I wanted to spend for a ""not so often"" used kitchen gadget. The Amazon price for the remanufactured unit solved that. The best thing is that you can now make several flavors back to back and not need to wait a day to refreeze the chiller insert that has been taking up too much space in your freezer. This model is far superior and not that much more money. Granted,it is loud and takes up  a lot of counter space, but David's recipes are getting rave reviews. I am using it all the time now and ordered a second machine already to lend to friends and family.  How is that for a stellar endorsement!",0

I bought this item when I had to replace my microwave and I was hoping to reduce 'microwave smell' - that funky tomato sauce smell that blows out from microwaves after too many spatters.

So I figured the food would blow out the vent hole of the cover and splat the roof of my oven, but reduce the problem. We use the oven mostly for reheating and melting. This cover exceeded my expectations.1. It fits my tiny Sharp R-209KK 800 watt oven - a bit of an overhang but it has never fallen off the platter.2. No discernable splatters even on the roof of my oven, which I wipe out every day! The steam vent (not a finger hole) on top releases the pressure at the top where steam rises. Even pyrex casseroles with glass lids are not as good because pressure builds, the lid lifts from the steam, and they shoot hot liquid in all directions.3. Food cooks better. We used to use paper towel, or another dish to cover the food. Here food cooks in a moist environment and doesn't 'explode' as much because of the steam regulation from the clever top vent. Paper towel would always slide off or sink into the food and cook into the food and let food blast out the edges.4. The cover doesn't get very dirty. I guess because food explodes less it is easy to clean by dunking in my dishpan and rinsing. Nothing has baked onto this lid.5. The food keeps better. If it is done cooking, I can leave the food in the microwave because the lid keeps it from drying out.6. It works great on taller containers that still fit under the circle. I have Rubbermaid microwave containers that are about 5 inchers tall and 5x5 inches at the base. I can set this lid on top of the container. The vent hole keeps the contents from blowing and protects the oven.The hole on top is not a finger hole. Use pot holders to remove anything from a microwave. Be defensive. It only takes one mishap to land a surprise burn. Never assume a spot is safe to touch.I note the comments about breakage. I wonder if that is from dishwasher heat? I find rigid plastic dishes cannot take the hot water treatment without becoming brittle, and often become opaque and crack, so I am hand washing which is easy because it hardly gets dirty. Dunk, swipe, rinse.I saw the cheap Chinese imitations. I will stick with American made plastics for food prep and save a job too. Nordic Ware is a great innovative companyAnd hey, if your food is piled higher than the cover you need something else.",0
4511,"Top of the line... OK. Admittedly, I don't do much of the cooking around the house, but my wife makes great soups using this Thermal Pot.Now... I'm not giving this pot a 5 out of 5 rating because of the great soups. I'm giving it because IF you use this cooking pot correctly, it will save you time and energy.When I first met my wife, she owned one of these pots (which she bought many years before in Hong Kong). It was also a Zojirushi. However, she got careless one day and left it on the stove while going to bed. Needless to say, she destroyed the pot. (Can't blame the pot for that) She claimed that under normal use... She would leave it on the stove top BOILING for 1/2 an hour and then put it into the thermal container before going to bed. In the morning, it would still be boiling (or close to boiling) and the soup would be great.So.... The pot was destroyed. She decided to buy another, but could no longer find a Zojirushi (They don't sell them in Canada) She decided to buy a Shuttle Chef. Crap! The soup was barely warm in the morning. She thought she made an error and didn't boil it long enough. Next time she tried... Same thing. It couldn't retain the heat. Well... it was just a matter of time before she left that pot on the stove before going to bed and completely destroyed that pot as well. (Oh... By the way, I have smoke alarms that don't work I found out that night!)Anyway... to put this long story to rest, I found this Zojirushi thermal cooking pot on Amazon that almost resembled her original pot. I decided to buy it as a Christmas present for my wife. She was estatic and started to use it immediately. (This time I always check the stove before going to bed myself!) Anyway.... We placed the pot in the thermal container overnight and... voila! A steamy hot pot in the morning, just like it's suppose to be.This pot will work if used properly. A lot of people make the mistake of taking the pot off of the stove immediately when the contents boil. This is not sufficient time for the bottom plates to store the heat. (There are 3 layers on the bottom) You must leave it on the stove top for 1/2 an hour (while boiling) and this will ensure continual heat while inside the thermal container.Wow... I wrote quite a bit!Anyway, Here's the summary:Zojirushi - 5 stars (if used properly)Shuttle Chef - 1 star (even if you use it properly)Boiling on stove for 1/2 an hour before placing in thermal pot - GOOD.Leaving pot on stove overnight - BAD",0
4512,"What a great idea!. I've only had this french press for about a week, but so far I love it. I keep it at work so I can avoid the swill that passes for coffee in the lunchroom. I can't attest to the mug's leakproof-ness since I don't actually travel with it, but it is very convenient to be able to brew and drink from the same cup. The stainless steel mug does a nice job of keeping coffee hot for a long time. This is worth the extra money over the plastic french presses, definitely",0

4523,"More Than One Way to Fry a Donut. I'm a proud celiac chick from Finland, but I'm also a lover of homemade donuts. Now, for those of you who don't know what celiacs are, we can't eat any wheat or gluten. In plain-speak (no, I'm not implying you're stupid), we can't eat flour. It runs along the lines of an allergy, although the experts will gladly look down their noses and tell you it is NOT.So how the heck do I eat donuts when they're made completely of flour? The answer is my cooking angel, Bette Hagman, who wrote up a donut recipe in one of her books, More from the Gluten Free Gourmet. Anyway, I use that recipe. However, I don't use this donut mold like I'm supposed to. No, I don't do baked donuts-what's a donut if you don't do the indulgent full-fat thing?I put the batter into three of the molds at a time, tip it into the oil, and I deep fat fry those little suckers. And god, are they good! So, my ultimate point here is that this donut mold is extremely useful, in more ways than one. So grab one--especially if you're a celiac--and put your imagination and cooking skills to work",0

I bought it about 3 months ago and there isn't a rip or hole on it. It has a high pitch squeak to it when the dog (or you) squeezes the ball. It definitely gets my dogs attention!!! I really like this ball over other balls I have bought, mainly because this one has feet. With feet, you can never predit where it will bounce or where it will decide to go.

4533,"The copper's nice but the plastic isn't. These copper canisters are handsome but there are some caveats needing mention.  First, the so-called ""vacuum-seal"" stated in its description is a misnomer.  There is no suctioning force to remove the air from the canisters.  If the seal was actually rubber, they would have worked more easily.  But this seal is a hard plastic cup-like ring that extends down from the lid to mate with the interior brim of the canister, and the lids would not function if you were to remove them like I wanted to.Next Problem:  The lids again-now they're too tight!   I have to hold the canister against my chest to pull it off--not convenient.  This means the contents of the canister might jerk up and out when it pops open. Quirkiness given, it should still keep the bugs out better than any loose ceramic set.The company is named Old Dutch, but these are made in China... (not the Netherlands.)Additionally, the canisters have no labeling like ""Sugar"" or ""Flour"" or a designated place for a label--another inconvenience.  Brass labels would have added character.For the 40 dollars, these 4 copper cans will still function and sit pretty no matter where you put them.  And, if you want them mostly for that, with just some occasional use, you have found an eligible set.",0
4534,"Amazing coffee, but with some small inconveniences. First, there is a HUGE difference in making coffee with a bladed grinder vs a burr grinder. The first pot I made with this Krups, I was hooked. The appliance is pretty easy to use, and it looks sharp too. Here are the downsides:- Coffee does stick to the plastic container that holds the ground coffee, which can make it difficult to operate without at least a little coffee not falling on your counter.- During grinding, the beans will get hung up in the hopper, causing the motor to whine a little because no beans are being ground. I just pick the device up and shake it, which remedies the problem.- The grind is a bit finer than I expected, and the coarseness adjuster doesn't seem to do a whole lot of adjusting.BUT, again, the coffee is wonderful! It's not a perfect burr grinder, but for the money, and impeccable coffee, I'm willing to deal with the other slight drawbacks",0
4535,"Counter Top Trash Can Looks Great. I got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded Sweet & Low packages.

Perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find. I used search terms like ""mini trash can,"" counter top trash can,"" ""small waste basket,"" small stainless steel trash can,"" but none of these got me to this item.

4537,"Milling Grains. This is an excellent product and it makes wonderful flours from whole grains.  We make fresh whole grain breads, pancakes, and other foods with this mill.  It is noisy and a bit messy but it is worth every penny.  I wish it were built with stainless steel rather than plastic.  I am concerned about durability but so far it seems to hold up very well.  Freshly ground flours are so much healthier for you than store bought that have a limited shelflife. If you want your family to eat healthy, I highly recommend this product.",0
4538,"Works great, remember to clear by spraying upside down until clear. This works great, put your favorite oil in, pump and spray.  This doesn't produce as fine of mist as Pam spray, but it still produces a nice even coat.  A little more blotchy than Pam, but I get straight oil, none of the stuff they put in Pam.Don't forget to clear the nozzle when done by holding the spray bottle upside down and spray until the pressure is gone.  This will clean out the intake tube and prevent the dribbling as the 1 star poster mentioned.  Do this in the sink so you don't make a mess.  It is also a good idea to clean this occasionally, run some soapy water through it and then rinse until no soap comes out the nozzle.I am very happy with the Misto oil sprayer, and it works great for bread baking.  This doesn't work great for keep the bread from sticking to the a deep bread pan (use Pam or equivalent for this, works better), but it is great for misting the top of the loaves to prevent them from drying during proofing.

4548,"better than george. I have been using the smallest foreman grill for some time and decided to get a larger grill.  I read the reviews on this and similar grills and decided to try one.  So far, I really prefer this grill and have been using it exclusively.  It does not get quite as hot as the foreman, which I like because the food does not dry out as much.  I always use the 5 minute warm-up as recommended.  The grill does not slant downwards like the foreman, so the food does not try to run off of the grill when you open the top.  The drip tray is located under and to the side of the grill and snaps in, a feature I like as the foreman tray tends to move all over.  The lid floats and is heavy enough to press down on the meat when lowered, making better contact with the top of the meat.   Sometimes I had to flip the food on the foreman to get the top side cooked.In short, I think this grill is superior to the foreman and I am glad I bought it.I bought this at Target as Amazon has still not fixed my account and it has been several months.  I have bought many items elsewhere because of this and Amazon is missing out",0

Everyone watched with glee as this particular German's funnel sprayed the wine out of approx. eight small holes at its base and turned this symetrical two bottle decanter red with my excellent 1999 Benziger Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The Wine Enthusiast Aerating Wine Funnel with Removable Screen allowed more wine to flow around sediment and was easy to remove and clean. This is made of a quality stainless steel and will last for years in shinny brilliance. My wife bought a funnel at William Sonoma the next week. It has a small one inch stem spot welded onto a small screen. It fell off before its first use. I took it back and started my search on Amazon the next day for the real thing.

4554,"Makes a pretty cake if you're careful. You'll get compliments on your daisy cake -- if you take care in preparing the pan for baking and in adding a glaze. I had trouble unmolding my first cake with NordicWare's Wildflower Pan, so I contacted the company for help. They advise using Crisco and Wondra flour. Although I prefer butter, the Crisco worked far better, but I took extra time to use a pastry brush to apply the Crisco to ensure getting into every nook and cranny. I did not like the recipe that came with the pan, so I asked about additional recipes. The only response was to use a standard cake mix. This was not very satisfying, as I prefer from-scratch cakes. However, I do sometimes use a cake mix that I ""doctor up,"" and have been pleased with the results. Even the addition of grated citrus rind in a glaze can disturb the lovely pattern of the cake, and even a thin glaze must be applied very carefully, or the flower petals will break up.",0

I also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients, so I think I will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard.My only gripe is not with the machine, but probably with Amazon because I did not get the model that was pictured.  I got the HD.

4560,"Great variety, easy clean-up, wondeful machine!. I have the black Fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room), and my wife and I already love this machine.  We have tried all sorts of mixes, and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do.  This is one of the first times I've been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it.Physical properties: It handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray, which is largely unneeded anyway), and all our ""standard"" mugs.  The drink head moves up and down, so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with ""frothy"" drinks than coffee and tea).  When it brews a filterpack, it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and, thus, keep it from dripping as you remove it).  The water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long), but if you have a ready source of water nearby, it shouldn't be a problem.  The tank fits better and slides on easier than the Senseo (which we also have).Flavor-wise: It's made by M&M/Mars, so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called Indulgence fare) is excellent.  Coffee blends are quite good, especially the darker roasts like ""French Roast"" and ""Sumatra"".  Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks, moreso than other chains.Clean-up: Wipe the inside of the drink head, and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly ""splashy"" drinks.  No need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine, especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug.  Of course, you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low, so your first few times, you'll probably get a drip here and there.Final bits: We've had the Senseo since its launch.  Between pods that need ""pre-wetting"" to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks, the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia.  We drink coffee, tea, espresso drinks, mixed blends, and sweet-tooth-friendly ""indulgence"" mixes every day with the Flavia, and it's brain-dead-easy to use.  Certainly easier to clean up after, too!  If you're on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings (like Senseo), get the Flavia.  Keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the Flavia.    I'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now, made over ice, and it's fantastic.  Highly recommended",0

4585,"Longterm User of HB Indoor Grills Speaks: Just Bought My Third Model!. I want to speak up on behalf of Hamilton Beach indoor grills.  I just ordered this 25295 model, which is my third in about a half-dozen years.  It probably will last a few years, making that three in ten years.  That's not bad at all.What went wrong with the one before this, the previous model 25285 with removable grids, is that the turn-off mechanism stopped being dependable.  I noticed that my steak got overcooked, but thought it had been my fault for leaving it on too long.  It wasn't until the next morning that I saw that the grill never shut itself off (eeek: stayed on overnight).  So it's time for replacement -- after four years or so of constant use and perhaps some casual abuse.The model before that, replaced with the 25285 (for cleaning ease and because I wanted white), was given to my mother, who also got a few years of faithful, second-hand service.  So that one too lasted about four years.  I also gave one away as a present -- and its recipient, who had been suspicious of such contraptions and has a tiny kitchen, loved it and used it for years.  Therefore, this is the fourth HB indoor grill that I've purchased.If you are single and don't have a lot of counter space, this is tough to beat -- particularly for less than $50 and no tax or shipping charges, and an easy return policy in addition to the one-year warranty.  Before I bought the 25295, I checked out the George Foreman grills (including the ""next generation""), Cuisinart, T-Fal, etc.  Some of the others have some nice features that this model lacks -- such as temperature control, greater grilling area, floating hinge.  But to me, that was offset by how much bulkier they are, oftentimes quite ugly IMHO, and not that much more bang for the buck.  I really don't like it that some of the smaller GF models turn on only by being plugged in the wall.  Maybe this is intended as a safety feature, but I wouldn't want to constantly have to mess with that.  A power button should be essential, rather than considered a nicety for which they charge extra.This does a nice job with grilled sandwiches, meat and fish, sliced vegetables, etc.  You get grill marks and it cooks everything right, after you learn the appropriate times for different types of food.  It's cooked bacon fine, IMHO.  It does quite nicely with frozen meat or veggie patties and chicken breasts.  I particularly like to throw on a fairly thick frozen sirloin, or salmon or tuna steak.  The outside gets browned, while the interior stays moist and lightly cooked (if you catch it in time).  The reservoir cup holds a lot, so if you marinate the meat or fish and it drips, it's not a problem.  If it's not essential to dispose of the fat that drips off and collects in the reservoir -- the ostensible purpose of indoor grills and still their prime marketing claim -- you can find ways to use it to baste the food during cooking (buy a second cup or find something else to use) or use it as the basis of gravy.Some reviewers have noted that the nonstick surface on the GF models flakes or chips off over time.  These HBs hold up, but you do need to follow instructions.  Wipe the grids clean while still warm and wash in the sink or dishwasher.  Don't use cleaning products or tools that will strip off the nonstick covering, and use spray oil before grilling.  Also, let the grill heat up 5 min before use, as per the directions.  Food placed on hot surfaces sticks less than food that heats up with the surface (of course, such caramelization also enhances taste to some extent, so you may want to fiddle with this for your purposes, carefully scraping off the caramelized parts to avoid scratching the surface).  If the grids get messed up, they can be replaced as long as the parts are manufactured, which probably will be for a while.The models I've purchased have made a tidy ""footprint"" on my countertop, and I know how to make it do what I need it to do.  It wasn't worth it to spend maybe even twice as much for a few more bells and whistles, when I would be settling for a style that I dislike and losing half the counter space.  Yes, it can be put away after use, but I like to have kitchen gizmos within easy reach, particularly if I like the way they look.  The grill gets too much use to be constantly tucked away anyway.  And this model matches my other stuff.  If I had chrome appliances or did more entertaining or a larger counter area, I would've been seriously tempted by the Cusinart model, though, I have to admit.Therefore, I think some of the negative comments need to be taken in the context of maybe judging too quickly or nitpicking, needing a larger size grill for a family, preferring more features, using it incorrectly, etc.  Neither I nor the people I know who have had HB indoor grills have had problems with melting plastic or plastic odors.  HB makes the ""Honda"" of indoor grills.  It's dependable rather than flashy, not big which matters for those with small kitchens, rates well with consumers and through independent tests, lasts for years, and isn't more than a one- or two- person household needs.  Why pay (and pay for the electricity over time) for what you don't need?  If your needs are modest, a modest indoor grill may well suit your purposes.  I look forward to the new grill living up to the quality of its predecessors in my household",0

4612,"Just what I was looking for. I bought this because I wanted to divide gravel vacuuming and water changes into two separate steps, so I could spend more time cleaning up my dwarf puffer aquarium (it gets messy). First I tried the ""Penn-Plax Air Vac Aquarium Gravel Cleaner"" which you hook up to an air pump, but that didn't have much suction. This battery powered model has as much suction as a normal gravel vacuum (the kind that's just a hose and a tube) or a water change kit like the Python, but it keeps all the water in the tank for you.I had just one problem with the Profile, but it was easily fixed. I thought I had to attach the adjustable tube (item #14 on the side panel of the box), but this made it too long to work in my 10 gallon and 20 gallon-long aquariums. (If the handle end sticks too far out of the aquarium, the pump won't prime, and you'll hear a buzzing sound and get no suction.) As it turns out, the gravel attachment will also hook up to the unit directly without the extension tube.The Profile require 2 ""C"" batteries for power, and a rubber band to keep the sock filter from slipping off. It will work with any aquarium from about 8-9"" deep up to 20"" (or deeper, if you don't mind getting wet).UPDATE: I've stopped using this. The reason is because it kicks up a lot of microparticles which pass through the sock filter and sort of fog up the aquarium, so I worry about how well it really cleans. It gets the big particles though",0

4617,"Shun Knives are Beautiful, Elegant, and the Sharpest around. Shun knives are beautiful creations period. Since I'm Asian, I love the tradition look and feel of this Japanese knife. I love the beauty of the blade and the dark, polished, Pakkawood handle. The unique ""D""-shaped, Wood handles are preferable. The shape fits my hand perfectly, and the wood does not get slippery when wet - providing a very secure hold. The steel is of utmost quality and sharpness. Do not put this blade into any old electric knife sharpener! Electric knife sharpeners are made to put one angle on any blade. These blades come with a 16 degree angle and you don't want to be changing that angle. There are electric knife sharpeners that can sharpen these knives, but you'll have to do some research and find out which ones can be a fit with these knives. I prefer to hone with a sharpening steel and manually sharpen with a stone if necessary (and I don't see it being necessary to touch it to a stone any time soon). The blade is sharp straight off the factory and as Alton Brown says - it's the sharpest straight out of the factory edge as he's ever seen.These knives are more expensive than most, but I think it's definitely worth it. To have the sharpest, most beautiful knife around - it's no contest. If you are on a budget, build your collection slowly. It's been said that there are only 3 knives that are the absolute basics for any kitchen: A 8"" Chef's Knife (or some kind of similar, large-ish chef's knife), a Paring Knife, and a Long Serrated blade for cutting bread and larger items. I would add a thin utility knife and a boning knife to that list next. Then I would add those ""in-between"" sizes as I get more money flow in.  Now if you're buying a whole set like this, you'll get it all in one shot and it becomes a better deal than pieceing your collection together, one-by-one.If you plan on spending any time in the kitchen, good kitchen knives are a definite must. Preparation is the bulk of cooking and when you have good knives, it cuts down on the danger of cutting yourself, it adds pleasure to the work, and it cuts down on prep time. Knives are also a very personal choice and it's best to at least go to a store and try it out for yourself first. Shun Knives are designed by the Japanese, so remember - it's designed for small hands. This makes it fit most women's hands perfectly, but I've heard of guys with larger hands not like it so much and going back to the German knives. So definitely try it out. It's a personal thing, it needs to fit you.Why spend so much money on a knife? Well, if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and you almost always have to bust out a knife to prep a meal from scratch - why not use the best? Why spend that time with items that you love and brings you pleasure to use? Many times, it's the small things that brings us the most pleasure in life, and I consider my Shun knives as one of those things. Having something so beautiful and yet so sharp and perfect - it makes my time cooking just that much more enjoyable.Another good thing to know is that although the Shun Knives are usually offered for right-handers, you can get these knives for left-handers. You just need to find the guys who stock and sell those ones as they are less known, and less common",0

4626,"Good design, great waffles. I am loving the aesthetics of this thing.  It reminds of the heavy-duty, no-nonsense waffle makers at a Waffle House.The iron heats up quickly - no more than five minutes from off to level 4.  The indicator lights are bright, and the audible alert isn't loud or shrill.  Any stainless steel case will get hot, so if you are accident-prone, skip this unit and go with one with a plastic case.I have to disagree with some of the complaints about the handle insulation - this unit isn't a panini press, and doesn't require you to grip it with your whole hand and yank up.  Slight upward pressure with your thumb is all that's needed to disengage the lock, free the waffle, and open the lid.  And speaking of the locking mechanism: it works perfectly on mine.  It is very subtle and does the job.The plates are non-stick and don't require oiling.  I have made dozens of waffles, ranging in doneness from spongy to crispy, and every single one has released cleanly.  Again, all it takes is a gentle upward pressure on the handle with your thumb until the lid opens.One welcome surprise about this unit: it is designed to be stored vertically!  The plate hinges and lip of the base make a tripod, giving you more storage options.My only issue with the WAF-R is that I think the gutters could be a bit bigger.

4629,"Can't get enough... ... of this toy! Our dogs prey drive goes wild when they see these balls come out. We have to monitor the use though. They each have to have their own ball and we have to take them away from the dogs before they collapse. They go really go crazy for them and would play 'soccer' for hours until they drop. The only down side is that our dogs can dig their teeth into the plastic around where the small opening is on one end. This creates gashes which we need to keep scraped down after play. Otherwise the dogs mouths, cheeks and lips become very sore and cut up as they roll the balls around the yard. (Keep in mind we have very strong dogs with high prey drive) When they have the gashes made, they can carry the ball around. Ours carry them proudly around the yard as if it is a trophy! If the balls were made of some sort of really hard rubber like a black type Kong or something it would be better, but then they would weigh too much. For the money - you just can't beat this toy",0

My old one required big heavy batteries. The pillow that inflates is a good height - I had worried that it would be too high.  It inflates into a real sized tall bed! And doesn't topple over because there are two inflated support tubes on the bottom of each side. I haven't slept on it yet, but I did recline on it, and it was very comfortable. I certainly recommend it.",0

Have had the matching containers on my wishlist for some time, may soon break down and buy them for myself as a present from my birds for Mothers day along with the salt and pepper shakers.  My work allows me to be able to get to many different stores, I am therefore able to comparison shop.

This decanter is glass.  The box claims it is ""mouth blown glass"".  It is made in China.  The photo in the description depicts it holding one full bottle of wine (750 ml).  It does not drip when it pours (just one drop rolls off the lip much as what happens when you pour from a wine bottle).

No complaints so far",0
4645,"Perfect for my studio aparment. I have a studio with low pile carpet and a teensy kitchen and bathroom with linoleum.  I was so pleased to discover that this thing cleans both!The pros:*The brush roller thing at the bottom does a great job picking up things from both the carpet and hair/crumbs from the linoleum.*You don't have to mount the charging bracket.  It has a holder on the side for the battery by itself, which pops out of the vacuum easily.*The roller thing is between 9""-10"" wide, which is a reasonable size to get in between pieces of furniture for me, not as wide as your standard vacuumThe disappointments:* The roller thing doesn't come off.  I have been reluctant to use it as a dustbuster because it can leave marks if you're using it on more delicate surfaces than the floor (like paint).* If you have cleaned up hair the roller thing is really annoying to clean.  The first time I used it I thought maybe I could just unscrew the cover, take out the bar, clean it and put it back.  DO NOT DO THIS.  All the moving parts are precariously placed inside the bottom - I never did get the little wheels back inside.  Now I just do the best I can with needlenose pliars from the bottom.The upshot?  It's an inexpensive tool that does exactly what it's supposed to.  The roller cleaning problem will probably result in fewer years of use than otherwise, but for the price it's a very reasonable problem to have.",0
4646,"Great value for an all-in-one unit. Received this as a gift (at my request!) over the holidays and have been very happy with it.  Unit is easy to use and produces a quart and a half of nicely consistent ice cream in 30 minutes (helps a lot to chill the mix first).  Much prefer it over my old unit that required the bowl to be cooled in the freezer overnight for three reasons: doesn't take up the freezer space; doesn't require advance planning; let's you do multiple batches without waiting.  One very useful feature is that the mixer operates separately from the compressor, so you can turn of the mixer off when it is no longer able to turn but keep cooling the ice cream in the machine for firmer texture.As some have noted in reviews on other sites, it is somewhat noisy, but not unbearably so.  Other than that, no real complaints; especially considering that this is not a commercial grade unit and only costs $175.  I would definitely purchase again.Some recommendations based on my initial experiences:1) Cool the mix first and you'll be able to make the ice cream quickly at the end of a meal for an impressive dinner party treat.2) Ice cream will be on the softer side (but great) when it comes out of the machine, so let it set up for an hour in the freezer if you like it firmer.3) A little corn syrup (about a tablespoon) will create a smoother consistency for some ice creams.4) Be careful to fill the bowl only halfway up as the ice cream gains a lot of volume as it freezes.5) Even if you are not usually a fan of fruit ice creams, try them in this machine.  Fresh strawberry ice cream blows away the store-bought stuff.6) The included directions are pretty clear, so read and follow them",0

4648,"Take back your sink!. I bought one of these from Amazon 2 weeks ago, with the extra filters for half of what I would have paid retail.  At first my boyfriend nixed the fountain, as it was very loud.  Luckily, I remembered another reviewer had mentioned that the unit could be noisy if the water level was low.  Once I filled it up almost to the rim, we could barely hear it.  The cats adore it, haven't been in the sink or toilet (well, maybe once or twice!) since we bought it.  I give it 4 stars only because it is rather difficult to clean.  It's a great deal for a really good product",0

For the price, it's a very good value and I plan on purchasing other colors as well as more of these. I should have given them FIVE stars",0

I found this on clearance at Target for $35 and I bought a Cuisinart gold filter for it.  I did not like the fact the Mr Coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter.  Anways, there is not much I can say bad about this machine.Things I like:  looks,brew seletor,self clean feature,makes good coffee,the carafe is one the best I have used.  The easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well, inexpensive and work pretty well.  I dont have any of the leak problems.  Things I would change: could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker,the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but I tend to set it to go on before the family is up.  Overall for what I paid for this I'm very pleased",0

4653,"These work great, but I can't give them 5 stars because they cost too much for 4 dinky pieces of plastic!. For 4 pieces of plastic to cost this much is outrageous. These do work in my Senseo. They make great coffee and tea. Just load them and stap the top on. They have to be put into the 2 cup pod holder.I bought these and was shocked at the high price of shipping. The shipping was more expensive than the pods. They came in a bubble wrap lined envelope.Just use common sense and let them cool before trying to clean them",0
4654,"Okay for the money but nothing to write home about. Unlike what the photo suggests, the entire set is black and not dark brown.   This lends a versatile and contemporary look to the tables which would work well if you have modern-looking furniture.  However, the black finish seems to work against the veneer pattern.  The black ends up being shiny, so not only does the veneer pattern stand out but so do the natural patterns in the wood and any scratches or dings.  The end result is a rough almost old-looking table.  Seems like the wood could also have been sanded down more since there's still somewhat of a raw feel.On the plus side, both the coffee table and accompanying end tables are remarkably sturdy.  They are not easy to get knocked over, and they seem able to hold heavy items.  I've got my computer, printer, and feet resting on the coffee table right now, and it's not budging.  The coffee table is small and more suited to go in front of a loveseat--a perk if you're living in an apartment with limited space.  An advantage to the black color is that the end tables can go anywhere.Overall, I can't complain because $99 is a good deal for cheap apartment furniture.  It's functional, affordable, and reasonably attractive.  But there's no mistaking this for anything but low end furniture",0
4655,"Phorm Light- I like it!. I've had the Phorm light for a month and I enjoy it. It lights up the whole room, its compact so I can store it away when I'm not using it.  It's much better than using an overhead light.  I just really like this product and I'll go even further to say that this is the best product that I've bought so far this year.  And I'll constantly wonder what took me so long to order it, instead of struggling to get some light for reading out of tap lights",0
4656,"Just as expected. This was delivered promptly, packaged well and looked exactly as I expected it to.

To top it all off, the design is very appealing and will only enhance the beauty of a well-laid table. I have the trivet in dune, and my mother wants me to order one for her as well",0

They arrived in about 4 days with free shipping in perfect condition, double-boxed with plenty of bubble wrap and packing material.  I find these glasses to be an exceptional value.  I won't quibble with reviewers who believe their Riedel glasses deliver wine with better taste.  I'm a wine enthusiast, but admittedly not an expert.  My palate cannot discern a difference drinking the same wine out of these glasses versus a Riedel product.  And at less than half the price, with great functional design and looks, I'll be purchasing Spiegelau products again",0

They are not top quality/heavy duty but the reason I love them so much is that my husband only wants 24oz. mugs but he has a tendancy to lose/misplace his coffee mugs on a regular basis and I don't mind so much when they are only about $5-$7 each.  They are durable and he loves them too,0

Yes, they are expensive, but they are probably the last knives you will ever have to buy",0
4669,"A great machine at a great price. The box arrived bashed, but my refurbished machine was packed like a newborn baby and arrived safe and sound. I unpacked it, assembled it in 3 minutes without looking at the instructions, plugged it in, scanned (literally) through the book, and let her rip! In about 20 minutes I was eating the best dessert imaginable.See, I wanted healthy, low sugar, non-fat desserts. I got a jug of organic black cherry juice (talk about antioxidants!)from the healthfood store (for about $3!) poured some into the freezer until it was about halfway filled, added about a tablespoon of wildflower honey and turned it on. I didn't really know anything about ""overrun"" which has to do with adding air to the mixture. It turns out that this makes a fluffy, creamy dessert without adding butterfats and cholesterol.Here in Santa Fe we have some swanky local ice cream that runs $6 per pint. They have exotic flavors like Lavender and Garam Masala and Chai. Frankly, I've got them beat and mine is healthier.Some of these reviews say how loud the machine is. I don't find it so - it's about as loud as my dishwasher. And it is a soft-serve ice cream maker which allows you to eat right away or store for later. I used to have an old Simac ice cream maker which was top loading like a washing machine, and it was a devil to clean. But cleaning this is easy as can be.Do you NEED an ice cream machine like this? Probably not. But if you love to cook and you love to eat wonderful, healthy gourmet food, this machine transforms kitchen work into a relaxing and enjoyable hobby that brings health to you and your family and friends",0

The rest of the betta food brands I have bought sinks to the bottom and then it will rot if you don't' immediately clean it out and kill the fish.So if you want  good betta fish food then betta bio-gold will save you allot of time cleaning your fish tank more then you should have to. I just use a  small container to put the fish food in and take them out with tweezers so I don't dump to many in and if after a few minutes there is some still left I use tweezers or a net to get the few remaining pellets of the TOP of the water instead of a bunch of sunken pellets which can be a pain to fish out.,0
4673,"Affordable Riedel!!. I've always been a big fan of Riedel glasses, but they were just too expensive and broke too easily.  These glasses are the solution to that problem.

In return, I grilled up some home-made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper! I really love this grill. Even though it's got a big surface area, it's no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away, and it cleans really easily. My tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm; the charred stuff wipes right off!I wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles, like the smaller G5 version does. Just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby! I do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage, though, given its size.Bottom line: I'd highly recommend this grill, especially if you're using it for a family of four or more",0

After doing some research on the internet, I found Spray Commander.  I had to watch her carefully while she was in the yard, and as soon as she started digging, I gave her a blast of citronella (button #2).  This scenario was played out 2 more times.  Results?

I cook rice everyday and I was never completely happy with any one rice cooker in all these years. I tried several different kinds, Sanyo, Aroma, Zojirushi etc., There was always something with each of these, uneven cooking, big splatters, bottom getting burnt, so on and so forth.  I finally got this one, recommended by a friend.* Perfect brown rice, white rice and pulav/pilaf.* Absolutely no splatters. I intentionally put 1.5 cups extra water and NOTHING CAME OUT - rice overcooked, but that is a different story.* Even though the lid is not detachable, cleaning is easy. Part of it is due to the shape; fancy looking rectangular ones are such a pain. I'd say crappy design.* Cooking vessel is definitely thicker than most cookers out there. Never had a burnt bottom even when left on warm for several hours.* I don't have to crank up my big oven for baking a small cake.

4690,"A must Have for Ultra Sharp Knives. This very understated, plain looking piece of kitchen equipment looks rather like a conventional sharpening steel with a white rod, but is in fact an ultra fine grit sharpening tool.Don't be fooled by the modest appearance - this is a very high precision piece of equipment.For high quality knives (eg Global) that are already sharp, but need that extra finish on the edge to achieve a truly razor sharpness, this ceramic rod is superb.  Global actually recommend ceramic instead of steels, and once you use this product you will see why !!!Incidentally, Global also market their own ceramic sharpener, and it's made by - you guessed it, Kyocera.All knives will lose their ultra sharp edge in normal use, and the usual method of refreshing (re aligning) the edge is to use a steel.This ceramic rod takes this process to a new level.   The ultra fine ceramic actually sharpens the edge as well as re aligning it.  The result is an incredibly sharp razor edge, usually with a few strokes.I have been using it for about 6 months now, mainly on my Global knives, and it is the best sharpening rod I have used - lot's better than conventional or diamond ""steels"".I recommend using it like a ""steel"", with gentle strokes alternating from side to side, holding the knife at very slightly greater angle than the sharpened angle.Not just for Japanese knives, this great product also works just fine on European knives.Buy it without hesitation.",0

The new Hamilton Meal Maker Express is without doubt my favorite new purchase. As my husband is a steak perfectionist it is imperative to experiment a little and then not to overcook by leaving the top grill down in order to keep the steaks warm (as they WILL overcook).  Other than that, I just trim the steaks, spray some olive oil on the grill, rub on some good steak seasonings and brush on some Kitchen Bouquet for ""looks"" and grill away.  Now I have perfect steaks and NO MESS at all.  Love it.  Love it.  Love it. Thanks.  VJ",0
4694,"Great LED nightlight. Cheap to run and last forever. This is the only two-LED light I can find. It's a little larger in size than it has to be, but it puts off more light than the single LED version. Uses a maximum of 1 watt of electricity. The frosted cover is nicer than the clear version. Hi/Lo switch slightly controls light output. LED's are slightly blue in color",0

Great for grilled cheese, ham and cheese or roast beef sandwiches.It also works good with fruit fillings, we just sprinkle powdered sugar on top after they are done.Our daughter used hers when we visited and after seeing how quick and easy it was to useand then tasting the results, we knew we had to buy one for ourselves. It makes it easy to make either one or two sandwiches at a time. I am glad we bought one because it came in handy for quick hot lunch snacks when I was hunting up North. ~ The Bos",0

I picked this up a few months back when the price was *too low to refuse* *cough*$29bucks!!!*cough* and I am MORE than happy with it!Like others have said... its not a big and fluffy down comforter, but did you really expect to get big and fluffy king size comforter for this price?Anywho.. the reason I'm here replying right now is because I keep checking back to see if I can pick up another for the same price. YES, I'd buy another...Hello Kim~ :",0
4698,"My first ""real"" dishes. For my 2nd apartment I decided to get real dishes instead of the hodge-podge I had from dorms and thrift stores. I could not be happier w/these dishes. The price was reasonable and they are incredibly durable.  I really like the plum-it's a rich purple and it was easy to match it to other fiestaware.  I liked the color so much I got the mugs and 2 other kinds of bowls to match the dishes. It was a great deal and it will be easy to add to my kitchen set.",0
4699,"The most wonderful pillow ever!. I've been looking for a foam pillow, remembering as a teen I had one and loved it.   I never can find a good pillow--my neck hurts, my TMJ would get worse, or my ears would be sore.  I have had a very hard time finding a good one, and was thrilled when I found this on amazon.  Latex foam pillows are far superior in comfort to the popular ""memory foam,"" which I think is so uncomfortable--I mean, it smooshes down and stays there--how is that support?  Latex foam, on the other hand, is light, but so supportive.  It's springy--it's gently lifting you up.  Anyway, I've had it for about a week and slept better than I have in years.  I absolutely love it!  Also, I can't believe how fast I got it.  When I ordered it it was out of stock, and I chose free shipping.  Had it in a few days.  Wow!  Thanks Amazon. (PS  The latex smells a little funny at first, but the smell was completely gone within a few days.)",0

4701,"Very Beautiful piece of furniture! Great Price!. I assembled it all by myself while my husband was at work and boy was I pleased with myself! The chest took me 2 1/2 hours, which I think was pretty good since I was doing it alone, plus my 4 year old daughter kept distracting me a few times! The only real problem came when I started assembling the drawers, you could not put the guides in the holes they had drilled for you because it wouldn't line up right, you had to move them all the way to the side.  The bottom drawer sticks more than the others. But I can deal with that, maybe one of these days I will get around to trying to fix that. I have noticed that the drawers open better when you squat down to the level of the drawer to pull it open. I have had no problems with knobs falling off as other people have stated, though in box the end table was in the knobs were broken in the package. I called the manufacturer and they are sending me two new knobs, don't know when they'll arrive though. There also was one part of assembling the chest that I had to skip because the screws it called to use were too small and too short for where they were supposed to go....they were to go under the bottom of the decorative molding in front and screw through the top of the chest, but the screw was way to small, would not even go through the wood. The top was screwed tightly down in another location so I skipped that step and you could not tell and it functions just fine. Very Sturdy and I highly recommend it if you are wanting something not too expensive.",0

4708,"Ecopod works great -- with practice. I have run almost a whole bag of coffee through my ecopod now and it has become my standard method now.  I grind the coffee in an electric coffee grinder at the most fine setting, then run the coffee through again.  I fill the pod about 3/4 full after tamping down the coffee very lightly. I get good foam, and a fairly strong brew.  Using less coffee gets more foam sometimes, but the downside is a weaker cup.  I have also put standard drip grind into our grinder to get it smaller in size, and that has worked good also.  Grinding the coffee very fine fluffs it up and so it looks like you are loading a lot of coffee for each cup, but actually its about a heaping teaspoon of drip grind coffee, so it is very economical.  Those having problems need to try again.  If it works for me, it will work for anyone",0
4709,"good find. how can you rate a tamper? well, it fits in the basket and it tamps down the coffee. I guess Terry's tamper does  just that. It was a great price, I mean come on, who's the numbskull who would pay $20 for an item to tamp his grounds?I was impressed by the fast shipping and great customer service",0
4710,"Cute and practical shape. I have had this teapot for about a year and it continues to be my favorite.  I usually use loose tea and the paper tea bags which can be purchased empty, so I don't have any problem with the tea strainer at the neck of the spout.  I admit that it does drip a bit, but I use a matching square plate beneath it with a dark colored terry potholder to catch whatever does drip and even with that small inconvenience (what teapot doesn't drip a little?) I just love the shape of the pot, the lid and the handle.  I have arthritis so the handle angle is important to me.  A teapot full of scalding tea is not what I want to spill and the handle on this pot is at a very convenient angle, making it easy to pour, even when full.  Most other pots have big round handles that are just not easy for my wrist to manage.I also like the lid which has two ""ears.""  When it is on the pot, it won't fall off, even if you put the teapot upside down.  To remove the lid, it must be turned to allow one of the ears to slip through a little notch, then the other ear will also come out easily.  It seems like a small thing, but I've dumped many lids to their early demise while pouring the last cup.  The shape of the handle on the lid is flat and a generous size which is easy for my old hands to grasp - another great feature I prefer over the little ""balls"" that usually adorn the tops of teapots.The pot also keeps my tea hot longer.  I'm not sure if it's the shape of the pot or the material it is made of, but I never use a cozy on it and the tea is fine to the last cup.  If I do let it go too long - like hours  I can slip the pot in the microwave and zap the brew to heat it up again.  Don't try that with Royal Albert!It's a chubby little cheerful teapot that just does its job well.  I've ordered another to give as a gift.  I'm tempted to buy another for myself...just in case",0
4711,just what I was looking for. I was looking for awhile for some nice solid flatware for everyday use and finally found it.  This is very solid does not bend I didn't want shiny because it usually dulls after awhile anyway.  We just love it I ordered 2 sets,0
4712,"Awesome Dirt Devil Platinum Carpet shampooer. I shopped and shopped and read lots of reivews prior to making my decision to purchase the Dirt Devil Carpet shampooer. I previously owned the Hoover upright shampooer and seemed to be happy about that choice for several years, but I wanted to investigate what was available and what was out there before making a new purchase on a new carpet shampooer. I read several good reviews about this Dirt Devil shampooer, comparing all prices, reviews and availability it seemed to be a better choice over the Hoover and other machines out there.  I can tell you now that I have owned it and used it for 6 months, I just love it.  I have to agree with the reviews. It is user friendly, has a nice size fill tank and a nice size storage tank and they are both easy to fill and drain and the machine is easy to use and does a great job.  You can use really hot water and it fills easily at the kitchen sink.  It also empties easily too.  The only draw back I can see, which other people mentioned in thier reviews too was that it is a little bit heavy; however, I think this is not a drawback but really a benefit because I think it really helps to clean and extract water from the carpet. This machine really shampoos's nicely and extracts the water well from the carpet, much better than the Hoover I previously owned.  In fact the carpet seemes to dry in only a couple hours after shampooing. I am sure this depends on the time of year summer/winter, but over all I am very pleased and happy with my choice. I love this shampooer, it stores easily, it is easy to use, and it really does a fine job. It does much better than my previouse owned Hoover shampoo model, therefore, I recommend it to anyone. The Dirt Devil Platinum Carpet Shampooer is an awesome machine. It should last for many years because it seems sturdy at a great value for the buck. In my opinion, It is the Top of the line in its class, it is a great choice at a great price around $150.00.",0
4713,"Surprised at some of the comments re. cosmetics. Honestly you would think many of the ""reviewers"" here were submitting their knives for a beauty pageant and not using them to cook with if you read some of the opinions voiced here. However I feel another poster was on the mark when they mentioned that many probably buy their high price German knives as more of a status symbol/showoff item than as a true tool or utility item, I wouldn't be surprised if many of those commenting on scratches on the handle order out five to six times a week and the knives at most get used to slice a lemon for their gin and tonic.With that aside onto the product at hand, my wife and I were given a set of both Professional S (I believe six piece set) and large set of Henckels Ever-edge for our wedding, we owned a smaller set of Ever-edge but put a larger set on our registry because we wanted something nicer and more versatile. We took both the Six piece Pro S and the Nine piece Ever-edge back and exchanged it for the nice piece Professional S set (I happened to be working at a store which sold high end cutlery -Wusthof, Global, Henckels, etc... and happened to get a good discount on it). I also picked up six matching professional S steak knives to accompany the set.As I said above I worked in a store for a short amount of time which also sold other high quality brands such as Wusthof and Global however I chose the Henckels as at the time the price was the best of the bunch, the knives felt much better in my hands than either the Global or the Wusthof, and I greatly preferred the straighter edge of the Henckels over the ""belly"" of the Wusthof. Really it comes down to personal preference though as what feels good to me might feel awful to you. Also Wusthof and others are only sold either on net discounters or higher end cooking stores which is great if you like to hunt around however Henckles and their Professional S line are sold in a good deal of retailers, which to me means that ordering replacements or buying additional pieces will be that much easier and I will have a good deal more room to work in terms of price negotiation. So if you are a knife snob and need to buy your knives at the high end knife/cooking shop only and or will get annoyed seeing your knives for sale in Bed Bath and Beyond then you might not want to consider the Pro S line.Someone below mentioned ""Forged"" vs. ""SCT"" and from what I have learned/read on the subject the differences are so minor that the end user will never notice the difference. Basically it boils down to the blade either being forged from one piece of metal (older method) or on larger blades forming them from a composite, or forging two pieces or more of metal together to make one blade. Consumer reports and cooking.com refer to the Professional S style as ""Forged"" because it is very close in form and function to traditionally ""Forged"" pieces the only difference is that it isn't physically ""forged"" from one piece of metal. The other option is ""Stamped"" such as cheaper knives and Cutco.Overall I am more than pleased with these knives and wouldn't hesitate to buy them again. My wife loves them and they perform very well. While the finish might not have been pristine out of the box (Yes I noticed some scratches as well on the handles) one has to remember they are only knives and they are meant to be abused, when selling other brands I noticed the quality was no better or worse (Wusthof and Global had their share of flaws in finishing as well) so your mileage may vary. As others said, check these out in the store before you buy and compare to others, if you like a nice straight blade with a sure feel and a slightly smaller handle (good for smaller hands) then the Henckels might be for you.",0

4715,Great looking and easy to install Wall-Mount Wine Glass Rack. We've had a built-in bar for over 20 years and always had the countertop cluttered with glasses.  Since we have a very high ceiling in the bar we needed a rack that could wall mount and get them out of the way.  We ordered 2 of these racks on Dec 23rd - they were here by the 26th and on the wall the next day.  Now we can entertain having what we're serving on the bar instead of our stock of glasses.  Service was great through this seller (Kegworks) we got delivery tracking emails to let us know where and when our shipment was and when it would arrive.  Would definitely recommend this product and this reseller.  Check out the picture we uploaded to see for yourself,0
4716,Holds a lot of water. I had an electric water dispenser that held 5 gallon bottles and decided to try a more economical alternative.  My main concerns were to have non-clorine tasting water and to remove the hard water deposits that gunk up my coffe pot.  I fill the resivoir in the evening and put the dispenser back in the fridge to filter thru.  In the a.m. I fill 3-4 water bottles to take with me for the day and make a half pot of coffee.  I love the amount of water this holds as opposed to a pitcher.  It's slim design fits nicely in the fridge and my water tastes so clean,0

It's pretty much what I was looking for: it's got a nice solid and durable feel to it, good heft, a little pliable but thick, moderately broad and not floppy, isn't going to damage my nonstick pans and hopefully won't leech toxins into my food since I've been concerned that plastics might.  And the company logo in the metal's cute/ classy",0

Heat proximity breaker takes 30 minutes to reset, that's too long.The automatic switching between 1000W and 1500W works, but it really needs an obvious manual LO/HI switch (it says three speeds in the writeup, I found two?). The switch to disable eco-save mode leaves it set at 1500W, which is too high on a shared bathroom circuit.

4722,"Spirited stemware. If you enjoy grappa or marc (dry liqueur made from the lees of wine) it's important to serve it in a tall, narrow-mouthed glass. This type of glass traps the subtle aroma of grapes that makes drinking grappa an interesting experience. If you drink Kirschwasser or other eau de vie, the same glass is used. These work far better than brandy snifters which aren't really so suited to this type of delicate but potent liqueur",0

The piece is sturdy and solid, no wobbling, no loose hooks, and it looks very sharp!  I would give it a full five stars, but I've only been using it for 1 week, so I can't yet say how it will hold up after long-term use, and I do have one major issue;The product arrived without assembly instructions!  Fortunately, if you're assembly-gifted (and really you don't need to be that gifted), you can assemble the stand without difficulty, however, you will need your own Phillip's head (not mentioned anywhere, but that's something that everyone should have) and a bit of know-how.This may help:When assembling the pole, of course the piece with the holes will go on the top, for the hooks.The piece with the threaded hole goes on the bottom, and I believe that both washers connect underneath with the screw to hold the pole in place.  That's what I did with mine, and it's very sturdy.When you place the feet on the umbrella stand assembly, be certain not to tighten the allen-wrench screws, or you will not be able to place the Phillip's head screws at the bottom of the feet, to lock the feet in place.When you add the hooks to the top assemblage, do not tighten the allen-screws beyond tight, or you will strip the threading, and your hook will be loose.One other thing that would be helpful is a rubber mallet for knocking in the finial at the top, and the small, round covers on the hooks and the feet.In reality, these are the sorts of things that Vision Decor should tell you themselves, but since they don't, I hope this helps someone",0

I agree that the cartridge was not easy to fill -- the beads are a little tricky to get into the cartridge (they sort of stick to each other and to the bag they are in and to your hands, so it takes awhile to get them packed in).However, the cost savings definitely makes up for the slight trouble -- 3 separate cartridges would range from approx. $36 - $45, while this package of 3 refills only cost $19.00!

4742,"good idea... We have used this crockpot BBQ Pit a couple of times since buying it.  The first time, we made the pork ribs - very delicious - tender and tasty, but cleaning up the crockery insert was VERY difficult - required lots of scrubbing.  The second time, I sprayed it with Pam cooking spray, which made cleaning up easier but still required some scrubbing, even after soaking it.  The third time I used a disposable aluminum pan, put the chicken and other ingredients into it, put it into the crockpot and cooked away - perfect!  No clean-up (just toss the disposable pan) and we had a delicious meal.  I would recommend this crockpot if you want a larger crockpot than the typical one.  The ribs were REALLY good - fell off the bone tender!  I cooked two whole chickens at once in it and they were good.

She was so comfortable that, when the guest sofa bed became available, she elected to remain on the Aerosport Weekender Twin Bed. It is high enough to sit on, which is nice.

The Dirt Devil is easy to use and it's easy to clean. It's light weight and does a great job on my floors and flat carpeting. And it holds a charge for as long as I've needed it. So far, maybe 15 or 20 minutes at a time. This is the best purchase I've made in a long time and I highly recommend this little work horse.",0
4750,"Dog training collar. Having used a spray collar belonging to my friend's dog which only had levels of spray, the Commander having the 'beep' feature is proving it to be superior as you can get the dog not to view the collar as something to be afraid of. The only real problem noticed so far is that it is not waterproof and therefore has to be removed prior to deep paddling or swimming - easy to forget! Terrific value compared to what it sells for in the UK especially with the weak dollar. Would recommend",0
4751,"Love it; Cleaning a drawback, but not a huge one. I've had mine for about 4 years and just love it.  It's a perfect size for a single person or snack size for teens.Clean up can be a pain if you let the unit cool first.  I recommend wringing out a warm, wet sponge over the unit immediately after the food is removed.  That will loosen all the worst of the mess.  Use the plastic scraper thingie (it's a technical term, really! ;) to do a quick clean of the worst parts.  After you eat and it cools, it will be easier to clean then",0
4752,"A very nice set to work with!. I got the set yesterday and decided to put it to work today. It's very easy to use, you can use lower heat than with other cookware, easy to use my wooden tools with and the cleanup is easy. Emeril ""BAM""med a home run in designing this set! :-",0
4753,"Eclipse 3 Filtration & Illumination System. Really like this system. Easy to change charcoal filter and easy to pull and clean Bio-wheel. Never had an aquarium stay so clear so long. Only drawback, and it's a slight one, is Illumination is on front panel. That means if you're short like me the light is off during water exchange, otherwise you could go through rear panel.",0
4754,"All-Clad Stainless 3-Quart Colander - Love It. This is an excellent colander, I love it.  All my cookware is All Clad Stainless Steel so I decided to buy this colander and have not been disappointed.  Although this is the smaller of the two sizes All Clad makes it is very roomy.  This colander can drain a pound of pasta (even a pound of lasagna) without any problems.  It is also great for rinsing salad, the solid side handles make it very easy to manage.  It is made very well and is very sturdy.  The cleanup is also very easy.  Highly recommended",0
4755,"Amazingly spill proof. What a great idea for anyone with kids or a clumsy adult in the house!  These tablecloths look and feel beautiful, but their main selling point is their stain resistant design.  If a liquid is spilled on them, it just beads up.  You have to chase the beads with your towel, but they don't soak in.  It also washes amazingly well.  I bought the ivory one for my mother with her 11 grandchildren (think chocolate donut and marker stains) and it still looks brand new!  Needless to say, we have since bought many other colors for both of us.  I cannot recommend these strongly enough--and the price is great",0
4756,"Love it!  Worth it!. This is a great blender!  Yes it is expensive, but it is worth it!  If you just want to make the occasional smoothie you might not want to spent that much, but even if you did you would find it well worth the money.  And probably the only blender you will ever need to buy, it is strong and it lasts.  You can make your own flour, it can blend all parts of apples, etc, skin and all.  You can make hot soup, just by using the blender nothing else.  And with the same machine you could make ice cream.  There is millions of uses and it is super strong!  I very highly recommend it",0

4759,Good Cleaner!. I only gave this four stars because this grease remover probably isn't necessary for most folks.  Regular strength Cerama Bryte's pretty amazing all on it's own and it gets off all the tough stuff.  Try it first then buy this if you find yourself using more elbow grease than you'd like,0
4760,"Versatile and sturdy. When these arrived years ago, I was disappointed because they are too wide to keep coffee/tea warm for very long. But lately I have noticed I use them almost every day, for things like cereal, soup and even edamame. I use these more than the Gusto bowls because they are easy to manage and offer a more modest portion size. They're not for coffee, but you'll find dozens of other uses for these jumbo mugs",0
4761,"Does fit my ""classic Revere Ware. I bought this for my two ""classic"" Revere Ware 2Qt pots (marked ""Clinton, Ill"") and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces. All of today's Revere Ware, including this lid, are made overseas. The pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel, but this glass lid works fine.",0
4762,"Love Revere. All the bad reviews on the Revere pots and pans are totally off base. The newer Revere pots and pans are not excactly like the ones made 40 years ago in Clinton Illinois, BUT this cookware is wonderful. I love the light weight, it making cooking easier, also the taste of the food using these pot and pans is worth the puchase. I am so impressed with my set that I bought on Amazon, and the Amazon price was great. I've used froo froo pots and pans, heavy in weight, and they did not cook my food as well as the Revere!",0
4763,"Not as soft as expected but tightly woven for durability. I've never heard of a 1200 thread count and the price was so good, I couldn't resist. The weave is so tight, I'll bet the water beads up in the washer before the soap gets in and breaks the barrier! I do have to say that they're not as soft as I expected, although they are fairly soft - but perhaps with a couple more washings they will be much better. I'll bet that they will last a lot longer than general (100 to 200-thread count) pillowcases and through a LOT more wash loads, so I still think this is a GREAT deal",0
4764,"This Danby is a Cold Winner. I bought this attractive little appliance for use in an airplane hangar where the occasional consumption of perishable food and cold drink storage is desirable. This quiet running compact fit the bill perfectly. Some designs in this class of refrigerator are barely capable of holding 2 six-packs of canned beverage. Why bother?  This fridge with 4.3 cubic feet of internal space is generous enough to store a reasonable amount of perishable food stuffs. Just don't expect too much utility of the freezer though, as its capacity is quite small. The internal layout of the Danby is well thought out and the vertical beverage stack on the door is a welcomed plus. The upper portion of the door also includes a special clear plastic insert to accomodate up to 9 eggs, but is an easily removed option. You can even change the direction of the door swing by swapping out the reversible hinges. Sized at a reasonable 20"" across, the top of my Danby refrigerator perfectly accomodates a small microwave oven and the combination of the two is hard to beat when eating a casual meal miles away from the full sized comforts of the home kitchen",0

4766,"Neat Coffee Maker. Overall I really like this coffee maker! The stainless steel carafe is great! I only wish that the heating plate remained on for 10-20 minutes or so after brewing. It turns off right after the brewing is done. Which is a bit annoying especially when I set the timer for morning brewing and I'm running late. Plus, the ""alarm timer"" is called ""delay"" or something like that. Why not just call it ""alarm"" or ""timer?",0
4767,"My cat loves it!. Sigh. Cats are so picky. You never know what they're going to like. If I had a nickel for every toy I have purchased that they never gave a second glance...One trick I have learned is not to make a huge fuss over a new toy. They seem to like to discover things on their own, so when I bring a new toy home, I just set it on the floor and walk away. Don't even act like it's for them. I find that they respond better that way.One of my cats loves this thing and the other won't even look at it. I rate it a 5 because the cat that does like it goes crazy for it, and I don't even use catnip. He loves scratching on it, swatting the little ball around and he even falls asleep on it sometimes. Too cute!I have bare floors, but I don't have a problem with the toy sliding around, because my cat stands on the outside of the toy and it rests against his hind paws as he scratches with his front paws. He figured it out on his own and he doesn't have any trouble with it.Also, make sure you turn the refill over and use the other side as well",0

4773,"Turned my 9 month old Rottie into a perfect gentleman. I was very hesitant to use a shock collar on my dog so I tried everything else I could think of to control his jumping, barking and general disobedience.  I worked with him myself, hired a trainer, and purchased an audio and spray correction device but nothing worked.  With two small children in the house I could not afford to have an uncontrollable dog.  Maybe if he were a miniature pinscher or pug it wouldn't be a big deal but Hades was going to be a 125 to 140 pound Rottweiler when he is full grown.  That would be a recipe for disaster.  I purchased the Deluxe big dog trainer from Amazon (at the best price available).  Five days later when I received it I still did not want to use it.  After trying each stimulation setting on myself (even at level 10 it is not painful but it does command your attention), I adjusted the collar and placed it on my puppy.  Saying that there was an almost instant change in his demeanor would be an understatement.  He was a different dog in just a couple of days.  Within 2 days I only had to use the sound to correct him.  And now, only a few weeks later, I don't even need to turn the collar on.  He is a pleasure and I know that this product is the reason for his change.  Thank you Petsafe for this wonderful product. I have already recommended it to my friends.",0
4774,"Nice....but heavy. I received this cookie sheet today.  I haven't used it yet but thought I'd leave a review anyway.  It is very nice and even has ""cookie targets"" on the cookie sheet to get uniformed shaped cookies.  I like it for myself but it is large and rather heavy. If you have difficulty lifting something heavy you might go for a smaller or lighter cookie sheet.",0

Heavy, strong, sturdy, but stylish and comfortable, too, this may be the best 10 bucks we've spent this year.

If you're looking for a moderately affordable down comforter of high quality, this item will suit you just fine.  I met a girl with a really comfortable bed.  It made my own bed really unimpressive so i bought this comforter.  Made a huge difference.  I did notice that the edges of the comforter have more down fill than the center.  It seemed a little odd but while sleeping its hard to notice.  I think that is how these are made.  You can price other comforters, and some cost $500-$4000.  For less than $200 this comforter is a terrific value.  High quality, 15 year warranty.  Recommendable.  Be sure to get a duvet cover.  My pit bull now sleeps on the floor!I used the coupon code HOHOSAVE and it covered the shipping and tax.",0
4780,"My Husky can walk again due to Missing Link Plus!. This product is phenominal! I heard of this product almost 2 yrs ago, but didn't actually try it until Spring 2004. When my 8 year old Husky started limping severally from arthritis. She could hardly walk, and kept holding her front right paw up and limping. The vet put her on Rimadyl pain meds for 2 weeks. She still limped after 2 weeks. I heard how bad Rimadyl was on a dogs liver, etc. so we didn't continue with this medicine. I decided to try Missing Link Plus with Glucosamine, and in 2 weeks she stopped limping completely. Krystal is still on Missing Link Plus, I give her 2 tsp's daily sprinkled in her food. She's more active now and acts like a younger dog. She's even thinner and looks great. It also helped eliminate her constant ear infections. I have my 7 yr old Husky on this now. I have also used this for several foster dogs, a Boston Terrier that had hip replacement surgery and a lab mix pup that has demodectic mange. I would highly recommend trying this product for any hip & arthritis issues. For younger dogs not needing the Glucosomaine for hip or joint issues, I'd get the regular Missing Link, w/o the plus. Always consult with a vet first though. Not all vets know what this supplement is, so it never hurts to take in a package or print out the ingredients and info from the internet. But this product is awesome. It has helped my Husky to walk and run pain free again. It eliminated constant arthritis visits to the vet and I don't have to put her health at risk with a long term pain medication. This product usually sells for $22.00-$26.00 in pet stores for 1 lb bgs. Amazon has this for way under $20. This is a steal of a price and well worth every penny. Especially if it greatly helps your pet live a healthy life again",0

I don't really care for pepper, but when I buy it I buy a combination of coarse pepper and sea salt.  I love the little window that you open to fill it, as well as being able to see how much is in there.  I also like the cap on the bottom, so it keeps it clean sitting on my stovetop, but most of all I like the knob to grind the spice.  I have mine set on fine grind, but it is adjustable.  I think you could use it for any spice you want to grind, not just pepper.  It is fun and easy to use and looks nice sitting on my stove.  I love this gadget!",0

If you need to eat more of some side dish or dessert that this plate allows, shame on you!I use it daily in many ways and just love its very popular pattern - it's so civilized.

4794,"HOLY MACKEREL, MY CARPET IS CLEAN!!!!!. I have a Jack Russell Terrier and a Rat Terrier.  And now a new baby.I have been fighting a losing battle for years with my poochies' wiry fur getting ground into my carpet.  I tried the Furminator products which were great for temporarily reducing their shedding.  But this didn't address the mess that had already happened to my carpets and apholstry.  Every time I would set anything on the floor, even just after vacuuming, it would have hair stuck all over the bottom of it.  Now that just isn't going to fly with a baby in the house.I have laughed so many times reading reviews of these Dyson vacuum cleaners.  Why would anyone drop half a grand on a vacuum cleaner?  But when a friend with cats told me about the DC7 Animal she bought and how much stuff came up out of her carpet, I was intrigued.  As time wore on, I became obsessed.  And then my tax return showed up...I selected the ""Ball"" because of the enhanced maneuverability it touts.  I have lots of furniture and twists and turns that made vacuuming tedious.  If I am going to spend this kind of money, by gosh, I need to not only get all possible crud out of my carpet but I need to be able to do it with ease and speed.Let me tell you something.  This thing is LUXURIOUS.  Yes, it is a LUXURIOUS vacuum cleaner!  Compared to my Hoover Wind-tunnel, it is quiet, I can hear my baby cry over the motor.  It glides over my carpet.  You can see an actual STRIP of clean carpet after one pass, several passes render the carpet almost pristine.  The stabilizer bar will provide that traditional vacuum handling for when your wrist is tired, but turn it off and ""The Ball"" allows you to glide in zig zags, around corners, up under furniture, it's just FABULOUS!The canister is also fantastic.  I was skeptical after having to fight my old vacuum's canister outside and covering myself with the crud I had just vacuumed.  But all you truly have to do with this thing is hold it over a trash can or inside a grocery bag and press the release button.  The crud just drops out.  Then you run the bottom of the cannister over the edge of the trash can and it will shut the bottom of the canister for you.  Fast, clean, easy.  Praise the LORD!It also works on bare floors.  You turn off the mechanical brush bar so it doesn't scuff and the thing just sucks up everything!One reviewer comments that the mini turbo brush is worthless.  I thought so too until I realized that I didn't have it properly attached to the hose.  Once it was attached properly, I used it to suck my short wiry dog hair off of their WOOL dog beds and 97% of it came OFF!  Now I am sorry, but you just wouldn't see that with any other vacuum cleaner.So now I can put things on the floor with no dog hair sticking to it.  I can vacuum without hurting myself, without aggravating my allergies too much.  My house SMELLS cleaner!I retract all mean things that I have said about people being idiots for blowing this kind of money on a vacuum cleaner.  If you have pets, then I would STRONGLY recommend this product.  I LOVE MY DYSON ANIMAL DC 15",0

My friends touched the mat just to ensure that it wasn't too intense - it startles the cats but obviously doesn't hurt them.I only had to use the mat for a week before my cats had learned to stay away from the couch.

4802,"Great espresso, poor steaming wand. For the price, I'd give the espresso making part of this machine 5 stars.  The portafilter and brew group are substantial and well-made.  I've worked at two espresso shops with commercial machines, and the parts on this moderately priced Gaggia are nearly as heavy and substantial as the big multiple-thousands of dollars machines.  I've had the machine for 4 days and have been brewing shots with Starbuck$ pods.  The toggle switches are easy to use, the reservoir is easy to fill, and the shots are aromatic and full of crema every time.  However, the steaming wand takes a star away from this machine.  It does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced Starbucks machine. This makes it hard to remove a cup full of frothed milk from under the wand without spilling. Also, the plastic frother contraption is silly. Actual frothing capability is pretty good, though the plain metal tips on the commercial machines produced finer microfroth, and were more fine-tuned to the trained barista's hand.  Overall, it's a good-looking machine, and I'm satisfied with it for my main purposes - iced lattes and americanos, and straight double shots, all of which do not require use of the steaming attachment.  This is a good entry-level machine that will brew you good shots, and look good on your countertop.  However, I'm expecting to outgrow it and move up to an Isomac with more refined steaming capability within a few years",0

I thought it would be heavier for that price.It's still a good pan and I found plenty of recipes online for baked donuts. They usually call for them being piped onto a cookie sheet, but I just used the pan instead with fine results.I do agree the donuts are a little heavier than normal store-bought cake donuts, but still they are good. Just don't over fill the shapes and your donuts come out fine looking. Nothing stuck, not even to the center flutes.I will definitely use it again and try many different recipes. The donuts are not too big or too small. Fill in the forms with a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut out, it makes it much easier to fill and the final product looks so much better",0

I got it for less than ten bucks from the friday sale, and I've already used it at least ten times.  It's GREAT for frying (i made fried chicken a couple of times, and it came out perfectly, no hot spots.)  i've used it to make spaghetti sauce, french toast, taco meat, chili and mexican shredded chicken for chicken nachos.  it's heavy enough to feel sturdy in your hand, and they're a snap to clean, even with the mexican chicken (you have to cook that down for a couple of hours.) I haven't had any problems with sticking or scratching, and it actually inspires me to cook.  You won't be disappointed by purchasing this pan! It's great for the cook that uses a lot of different techniques or methods of cooking (soups, frying, steaming).",0

There are no hot spots and the pot is fairly easy to clean. All of the receipes that we've tried have been marvelous. The meats are so tender and juicy, they melt in your mouth. This dutch oven has taken on ""favorite"" status in our house. Highly recommended",0
4810,"Fits the bill. I bought this board to cut large pieces of meat (chickens, flank steaks, pork roasts).  It's more than big enough for all these.  The reservoirs on the side do a perfect job of collecting all the juices that run off.The board arrived incredibly thirsty.  I gave it a healthy dose of mineral oil, which I treat all my wooden kitchen tools with, and this solved the problem.The board is made of cherry and is a bargain at the price amazon sells it for",0
4811,"I LOVE BRITA!. I am a water FANATIC.. and I have to have water that tastes good since it is the main liquid I drink. Brita is way less expensive than buying bottled water, and as another reviewer said.. the plastic bottles can sometime contaminate the water they hold. BRITA filters out some of those contaminates. Besides all that, BRITA water tastes great. I give it 5 stars, and hope that you like it as much as I do.  It does fill slow, and when its gone, you have to fill it up, and wait for it to get cold.. and that can take forever. I have one room-mate, and between he and I the pitcher was always empty. So if you are going to get one, get one that holds alot of water.. you will not be sorry. And if you are worried about cost, think about how much you spend on  for bottled water. I was drinking about 4 a week and then some.",0
4812,nice bowls. I like and dislike these bowls. What I like about them is the shape and size for certain foods and for the dishwasher.  They are actually too small for cereal if you would like to add fruit to your cereal.  They are perfect for oatmeal or ice cream but too small for soup or stew.  They are curved perfectly to drain and rinse well in the dishwasher.The depth of color is very attractive on the table,0
4813,Perfect!. I bought the matching bench a couple months ago for my new place and I love it. Recently I was in the market for a table to hold a lamp in my entry way and came across the plant stand. I didn't need anything too large and found the height on this item to be perfect as an alternative to a floor lamp. I put it together myself in less than a half hour and boy is it sturdy (with extra storage and display space too)! It is absolutely perfect for my needs. You won't be sorry with this piece...for any purpose,0
4814,"WOW, what a kettle!. I love everything about this kettle.  The clear guide on the side showing the level of water (in liters).  How quickly the water comes to a boil is astonishing, and when it does start to boil, the pot automatically cuts itself off.  The pot also cuts off if all of the water boils out.  The cord is short however to prevent tripping, but works just fine with an extension cord if necessary. This is a wonderful product",0
4815,Midgy Stays Home !. Midgy stays home with this wirless system. It works for us...but if you are having problems RTFD. I understandwhy some people get frustrated with the system...

They arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo.Even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses. To bad that they are not shipping in Romania.Update: After 5 days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice. I am so glad that I could make someone happy with these very nice roses,0
4825,Love it! Love it! Love it!. This knife is great. It fits so well in my hand and I feel very comfortable using it.  It is light yet sturdy.

The price is good and I will definetly be saving to buy more from Furi,0

4827,Crispy dry lettuce rocks. It does a great job of spin drying leafy vegetables. Yum,0
4828,"Attractive, Inexpensive. For the price, this wine rack is a good purchase. Once assembled, it is very attractive and fairly sturdy. Getting the two ends to sit level was a little problematic and the caps supplied to cover the holes where the screws are inserted are plastic, not wood, which I thought was a little cheesy.  Overall though, I really like this wine rack and would probably purchase it again to give as a gift",0
4829,"I think this is great!. I read all the reports last year about having a refrigerator thermometer, especially after Katrina, and figured it was about time I got one.  Well, I have been happy with this one!  I purchased it elsewhere but I love it!  Suction cups are tricky things and I noticed if I open and close the door a lot, it gets a little loose, but it is no problem to moisten it and restick.  I have kept this on the door so I can read it easily.  I just love a digital readout and am happy someone finally did one for the fridge!  I put it in the freezer for fun too, and it worked great there too",0

I have heard similar stories from friends who use this product, even one friend who works with feral cats.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with a multiple cat household",0
4836,"I love these scoops!. I have found these to be very handy. I've used them for kiwi, mangoes, even for making potato skins (I use the red one to scoop out some of the potato from its skin, leaving a nice shell to fill with cheese, etc). Because of their shapes, they are better than using a spoon to scoop stuff out. It takes a little finesse to use them, but I have found that they make certain prep jobs easier, safer (I don't need to use a knife in some cases), and less messy.",0
4837,"Love these knives! But NEVER put in dishwasher!. Well that pretty much sums it up. Great knife, good balance and feel. Keeps an edge most of the time. But never never never put it in your dishwasher. This purchase was to replace my previous knife which went through the dishwasher routinely. Then one day, we noticed the handle was warping and had hairline cracks all around the tang area. So lesson learned. And the warranty is only good if you don't use the dishwasher. Enough said",0
4838,"Convenient and attractive for a busy lifestyle. This size is perfect size for small-individual portions of mac n' cheese, lasagna, cup of soup, apple crumble.Great for large families where everyone wants to eat something different and busy singles who would rather freeze for later than eat the same leftovers for a week.Divide the recipe into individual portions and refidgerate/freeze.  Then just reheat as many portions as you need. This way you can make more dishes and have a variety in the freezer for later. Prep & Washup is simple as the ramekins are attractive enough to double as serving pieces too.",0

4840,"Seems a bit flimzy. This item is acually rated for 900 total pounds, but it seems a little flimzy to me.  I already had one shelving unit that I bought from a local store that is much beefier, but was not much more expensive.  I loaded this unit up with items in my garage and it is holding, but I don't fully trust it.  The side supports are a little too thin and it is just a bit wobbly.  I am going to anchor it to the wall, but I really shouldn't have to do that.  Also, the edges are very sharp.  I would recommend wearing gloves while assembling.  The instruction sheet did warn of this, but really.....how many people actually read the instructions",0
4841,"Lots of light. I love this booklight. It's small and light, so it doesn't weigh down the book and the color of the light it gives off is excellent, not to mention the amount of space it covers. It is good for reading, knitting, or any small projects for which you would need spot lighting",0

4843,"Easy-to-use, delicious results. The VillaWare V3600-NS Prego pizelle baker makes two 5-inch cookies at one time. It comes with a booklet containing easy-to-make recipes. The results are wonderful. You can roll the pizelles when they first come off the baker to make cannoli shells. It says not to use metal utensils, so I just used a toothpick to pry them off the baker. It was very easy to do. They keep well in an air-tight container, but don't really last long, since they are so delicious. I put a hard chocolate icing on some of the pizelles. The baker is easy to clean. High recommendation!",0
4844,"good unit. size and output quite adequate for a 12x15+ space I'm using it for. Yes initially,it stinks, but they do recommend runing it 2hrs. outside first, so no surprises.  Efficiency...hard to say whether I 'm saving yet, the timer's fine.It would be nice to have an actual temperature gauged thermostat, not a number from 1 to 10.",0
4845,Love the sheets. The sheets are just what I was looking for. The delivery time was good. Am very happy with my purchase,0
4846,Best Christmas Present. I have been so impressed with this set. It all cooks great. I think the frying pan would cook best with a gas stove. I love the mixing bowls that came with the set. It is a VERY good buy,0

4848,"So worth the money. I was in a car accident and have trouble gripping, and also have pain and limited motion in my shoulders, so even using the wing-style cork screws were uncomfortable for me.  I finally decided to splurge on an easy-to-use corkscrew.  I'm so glad I bought this one.You just place the corkscrew on the bottle, then turn the handle clockwise.  It's big and rubber, and easy to turn & grip.  The corkscrew goes down into the bottle, and actually lifts the cork out, as you continue to turn it clockwise.Then, to get the cork off of the corkscrew, you just turn the handle counter-clockwise.I'm so glad I splurged and quit struggling with cheap corkscrews.  You do still need the use of both of your hands, one to squeeze the corkscrew against the bottle, and the other to turn the handle.  But, it did not require much strength at all.It's also attractive, and comes in a sturdy plastic box, which is nice, as it won't get scratched up in my messy kitchen utensil drawer",0
4849,"Great for long-lasting fun. I'd been looking for a good durable chew toy for a long time, and have heard rumors about the 'Kong': it became a legendary toy in my mind, until I finally saw it in my local pet store and bought one for my Toy Rat Terrier.  As soon as I got home, stuck a treat inside, and now it's Marcello's favorite toy!  This'll surely keep him happy while I'm away at work, too",0

If the toast comes up and you can't reach it, push up on the handle and it's easy to grab.  If you only like bagels toasted on one side, you can put the halves in, push the &quot;bagel&quot; button, and voila! your bagels are toasted on one side (be sure the cut sides are facing out).  The bread is frozen?  Keep it on the toasting temp you like and push the &quot;Frozen&quot; button.  The toaster gives you your toast just the way you want.  Easy to clean.  Should be advertised better. Great bet",0
4852,"Better than Arm & Hammer pads -- but these have doubled in price!. Have used puppy pads in place of kitty litter for past several years after having a kitty w/ cancer.  Even after she died we stuck w/ the pads for our other two because they're used to it & there's no scooping & no tracking.All we can find locally is Arm & Hammer, which over the past few years have declined in quality and gone up in price.  These are much better and do not leak -- BUT unfortunately when I first bought them (a couple of months ago) they were only $11 per pk of 50.  Now they're $20!  No increase in value but a major increase in price.  What a ripoff.Unfortunately I can't change my rating -- I would give it a 2 if this would let me edit the rating",0

4854,"could be better. I had a Pampered Chef sprayer that I loved, but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years. I should have tried harder to find a Pampered Chef rep to buy another one, the Pampered Chef one works better than this one.However, this is not a horrible product. One drawback compared to the Pampered Chef one is that you can't see through this one to see how high the oil level is. You want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway, and when it is less than 1/3 full you need to fill it back up or it won't work as well. This unit is even more finicky than the Pampered Chef one about the level, it almost won't spray if the level is too low. But since you can't see through it, even holding it up to the light, you have to look down in and estimate how high it is. The reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is. You don't want to fill it all the way up, either.Then, you need to pump it more than the Pampered Chef one needed to be pumped. This one sprays a very fine spray, finer than the Pampered Chef one. And it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there.I think I know why my old one got clogged. So I'm trying something new: each time I'm done, before I put it away, I twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure. I think if you leave it pressured up all the time, like I did with my old one, it damages the nozzle over time. But time will tell if I'm right.Another tip -- don't fill it with anything but olive oil. Other oils evaporate and leave a sticky/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer. You know what I mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot, you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it. Olive oil doesn't do that, that's why I now don't use anything else on my stovetop (except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying). This type of sprayer will work much better if you just use Olive Oil in it, trust me.But if you have a choice, go find a Pampered Chef rep and by their sprayer. It's cheaper and better quality",0

When I first got them, I dropped the whole set from counter height. I was worried about cracking the plastic bowls.  And was happy to find all were in perfect shape regardless of my little mishap!  So, they are durable, stylish and extremely useful!I say buy a set, you won't be disappointed",0

4863,Good raclette. I bought this raclette a couple of months ago.  It is very easy to clean (you can put most parts in the dishwasher).  The only thing that I overlooked when I bought this item is the fact that you cannot control the heat (only on/off).  That does bother me at times.  Other than that it is very good price/quality.,0

4866,"Danby Countertop Dishwasher. Well, The only problem I had with mine is lifting it by myself up to the counter. I have had my dishwasher for eight monthes now and have used it almost every day. I have not had a single problem with it at all. It works just as well as high priced built-in models. Just plug it in to any outlet, instal the faucet adapter and attach the quick release water hose and turn on your hot (or cold, it will heat the water by it's self) water and add the soap, turn it on and it's done all the dishes in it's longest cycle (it has four) in about 45 minutes. I'm a guy and love the thing. Before, you couldn't get me to do the dishes at the sink for a gazillion bucks! (Ask my wife) This thing is very well made. If you're hunting for a portable counter unit, get this one. It's well worth the money",0

4868,"Quality knife set. I ordered from Amazon, the KitchenAid KA1PR16N Cook's Series 16-piece Cutlery Set with Traditional Natural Block, Red Handles which is exactly the same as this set, but cheaper. The picture for the other set is wrong though because it shows polished handle ends for the steak knives, but the handles are red plastic only and the handle ends for the other pieces are actually brushed steel and not polished as shown in the picture. In essence, the knife set that is pictured here is the knife set that you will also get if you purchase the other KitchenAid knife set that I've mentioned above.As far as the knives themselves, the weight is perfect for chopping and the blades are nice and sharp. The funky red color looks cute in my kitchen too. The only negative is they're not dishwasher safe, but luckily they do clean easily by hand. Even though Amazon is having a hard time correctly picturing the KitchenAid knife sets, I'm very satisfied with the set that I received and thrilled to finally have a knife set to be proud of",0

4870,"Perfectly fits the books' atmosphere. For those of you unfamiliar with the ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity (after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum).  Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count.Given the concept of the story, this poster fits perfectly, with the orphans, standing together but otherwise alone, in the middle, with the shadow of the Count casting gloom upon them.  It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count",0
4871,very comfortable. I have had this for almost a month now and I am very impressed with the extra comfort and cushion this has added to the bed.  I was a little concerned that it might flatten out and lose its padding but so far it feels the same as it did new.  Very happy with this purchase and I ordered a second one,0

4873,Pleased. I usually only buy something if it has good reviews.  I'm pleased with this table that I purchased to put in my entry way.  It looks very nice there with 2 lamps set on top. The only reason that I rated it 4 stars and not 5 is because there are a couple of blemishes on the top.  I'll be able to hide them with the lamps tho!It only took me 10 minutes to put it together,0

Then, they were put inside a large box allowing lots of room for shifting and breakage and, finally, it seems, pounded on by gorillas. However, only one plate arrived broken, which seems a good sign of how well they will hold up under use. The dishes are not perfect either. There are significant imperfections on a couple of them, but the rest are more beautiful than the picture. My suggestion would be to buy more than you need and donate the imperfect ones",0

4888,"You Really Need This Floor Sweeper. At first, this thing is pretty odd: it is rather expensive, and appears to be a simple mechanical device.

For cleaning bare floors and flat carpets, nothing is better than this mechanical brush floor sweeper, and I give it my highest recommendation. This happy little device is in my Hall of Fame Floor Sweepers/Vacuums (the other members are the Wet and Dry Shop Vac, and the Panasonic Professional Vacuum Cleaner).I have used this sweeper (or ones like it) at various jobs over the years cleaning the floors/carpets in restaurant dining rooms. Only recently, however, did I actually get one for my home, and I love it.  Since it is lightweight and easy to use, many floors now get daily cleanings rather than their traditional weekly ones. It does an amazingly complete job of sweeping up every particle of dust and debris on the floor. If you have allergies, it is important to note that this sweeper does not kick up any dust (which brooms and vacuums all do). Since it is mechanical, it will work even during power failures. When you fold the handle down flat, it requires only 3 inches of vertical clearance for sweeping under furniture. Note that this sweeper does better in large, clear areas (like the living room) rather than small places that require manuevering (like around the chairs and table). Interestingly, it sweeps on both the forward and backward strokes; this also means that it has 2 dust pans that you have to remember to clean out, not just one.I do have a few quibbles about it. In order to fit into the box, the handle is in 3 pieces; if you do not jam them together hard, the handle might come apart (although this has never happened to me). It has trouble picking up small pebbles and pieces of glass. The brushes get stuck full of dust bunnies, and the supplied brush cleaner not only falls off the handle a lot, it does a poor job of cleaning the brushes, and you have to pull out the dust bunnies with your fingers anyway.  There is a 3 inch gap in front, since the brushes are recessed back from the front of the pan (like when you push it up against a wall). This means that in order to clean the wall edges, you have to run the sweeper against the wall and parallel to it.  Note that this sweeper does bare floors and flat carpets only; if the carpet is pile, shag, or is not totally flat and hard, you are out of luck.",0
4889,"Better Than Five Stars!!. 11/11/06 Update:  I can say now that I have no regrets. This knife is actually my favorite knife and the one I reach for first.  I have to force myself to use my chef's knife.  My Shuns are still sharp!I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives.  I finally stepped up and got excellent knives.  For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world.  [...]Great features of the entire line include these cool ""D"" shaped handles that fit your hand better.  Each knife is made in a right- and left-handed version [...].  The handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe!! The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives.  The knives are EXTREMELY sharp.   One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives.  The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle.About the 7"" scalloped santoku ... this is my first Shun knife.  It is honestly the sharpest knife I have ever used.  I minced onion with relatively no effort.  I didn't feel any resistance while cutting and the job went amazingly quickly.I have small hands and this knife felt perfect.  The weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand.  I will have to make adjustments to my grip as I get used to the knife.  (I used the traditional grip you would use on a German blade chef's knife my hand slipped toward the blade.)  This knife will not replace my chef's knife, but it will see a lot of action.This is an expensive, but lifetime investment.  I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website.  For ratings on various brands and types of knives[...]This is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of.  I can't wait until the rest of the set arrives.",0
4890,Great Pillowtop for the price. We recieved the pillowtop promptly. It is quite full and puffy- well made. We are using it on our guestroom bed and so far every one has had a great night sleep,0
4891,best coffee I ever had. best coffee maker but the price here is a bit much you can get the same bunn at TARGET for under 100 dollars check it out I got mine at target 1 and a half years ago and no probles and I use it 1 or 2 times a day I paid 79.9,0
4892,"Where Have These Been All My Life!. These Hercules Hooks are absolutely incredible.  I wish I had them before my husband put many, many holes in our walls with anchors and screws.  If I want to relocate anything, he tries to patch up the hole, but it always shows.  These hooks make only a pin sized hole!  I hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it.  It is still there.Incredible product and well worth the price",0
4893,Very nice. Beautiful canister.  I purchased one in each of the three sizes.  They look fantastic in my kitchen.  Highly recommend,0
4894,buy it !! it really works!!. It really does sharpen perfectly !!!Ands is also very easy to use!!  It is also  nice looking and sturdy!!Great buy !,0
4895,latex pillow. I have used a queen size Beautyrest pillow for years but wanted a smallersize for travellig,0
4896,"Awesome Book Light!. I like this book lite becuase it can flex around very easily, it has a brite lite, if it's a hard cover book it will easily clamp on, and it has a handy switch on the back of the lite",0
4897,Compact and sturdy. This mill is smaller than I thought it would be but works well and looks great,0
4898,"My dog can play outside!. We do not have a fence, so the PetSafe wireless fence unit has significantly improved the quality of life for the dog and us.We adjusted the base unit to allow the forest creatures to escape.  We weren't able to put the invisible fence where we had planned because the chain-link enclosure (the dog's ""sand box"") beside our driveway interfered with the signal.The collar uses up the specialized batteries quickly, so keep a supply on hand.  Check the collar daily before using.  When the battery is replaced, the collar must be reset to the appropriate shock level.  We left the boundary flags up for 10 days although the dog figured it out the first day.  My dog has only experienced one shock (at a setting of four) on the first day; since then, the beep is enough to keep him within the boundaries.PetSafe retains control over the selling price of its products, so there are no bargain basement prices by any vendor.",0
4899,Pleasantly surprised!. Purchased two comforters and very pleased with quality. I comparison shopped extensively via the net. Upon arrival found website's description to be accurate. Comforter quality exceeded that of other brands advertised elsewhere at much higher prices. Delivery and e-mail notification process was very good.  Pleasantly surprised,0
4900,"I'm so glad I bought this. I've had this for over a year now. It's perfect! I had always found cooking rice to be very tricky. My husband even bought me an electric rice cooker, but that doesn't seem to work either (the rice seems too hard, not all the way cooked). What's great about this steamer/cooker is that you can adjust the cooking time because you put it in your microwave. The booklet gives you a range and I have found I need to use the maximum time listed. I only wish it listed more options -- it just lists instructions for 1 cup raw rice, and 2 cups raw rice. I'd like to see how it would work for less, to be able to make one serving of rice, but I guess I can experiment with it.What's also great is you can use it for steaming vegetables. It has an insert that keeps the veggies above the boiling water. The instructions say you can use it for pasta, too, though I haven't tried that. Pasta in the microwave just seems wrong somehow, but rice in the microwave works great! If you're looking for a foolproof way to cook rice, you should get this product, you won't be sorry",0
4901,"Works quite well. This wine pourer works quite well. My wife and I have enjoyed how nicely it pours and that it doesn't seem to drip. Apparently as a bonus it also is supposed to aerate the wine. I'm not quite sure of the extent of this talent, but it does seem to pour well - hence the clever name!One note, to pour nicely it does lessen the pouring flow rate. It's not bad for small-to-normal sized social gatherings, but for large parties where your goal is to get large amounts of wine in lots of glasses in a short time, there is a limiting factor with this pourer. For most people (ourselves included), this little do-dad does seem to pour effectively without the wine drip",0
4902,You will love this griddle. This griddle is worth $75-$85 at a minimum. When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised with the wieght and feel of this product. It is Calphalon - which is always great cookware - so I should not have been so surprised,0
4903,"Lots of Settings and It Works!. I am delighted with the fan and just ordered 2 more for my bedroom and sunroom.  The fan has a smaller profile, but is substantial enough to stand up to my giant breed dogs' tails.  On the lowest setting, the fan keeps my 22' x 14' room cool and I am only slightly aware of the noise (a hum) generated.The fan was very simple to assemble - it involved inserting 4 screws to attach the base to the fan.  Although I don't use the remote, it may be useful for others.  The LCD displays the current room temperature and the desired room temperature.  I like using the buttons and LCD versus having knobs or switches to adjust settings.  And the settings are incredible...The Speed Levels are high, medium, slow, and automatic.  On the automatic setting, the fan automatically adjusts the speed to achieve desired room temperature.  Be warned that this fan is NOT ""whisper quiet"" - certainly not at the medium or high level.  There is a distinct and constant hum.  But set to high, the fan blows papers off my dining room table, which is 5 feet away.  That's a lot of power to expect silence!The Wind Levels are normal (the wind speed is constant), natural (the wind speed resembles nature wind and shifts among slow, medium, and fast), and sleeping wind (the wind level cycles from fast to medium to slow, until stopping at the selected time).  *I'm looking forward to using the natural wind setting in my bedroom.  It will be like having the windows open, which is impossible here during the summer months.*The timer can be set for between 30 minutes and 7.5 hours, at 30 minute increments.  You can also select between oscillating and stationary.What's not to love",0
4904,Great saucepan. This saucepan is a convenient size.  It heats up well and maintains the heat.  The glass dome lids are great.  Very sturdy and seems like it will last a lifetime.  The clean up is also VERY easy.  Stuck on food and sauces come off easily with a little soaking and if that doesn't work the cleaning pad and Bon Ami cleanser finishes it off with little effort.  A great investment,0
4905,"KitchenAid Reconditioned Blender. Overall, I like this blender:Pros-VERY QuietGood Price (probably have to pay more for a different brand w/ sharp blades-see Cons below)Nice DesignCons-Blades not suited for chopping; they're designed for crushing things like ice. Doesn't work great for things like fruit smoothies; there are chunks of fruit left that don't get liquified. I have an Oster blender and its blades are sharp; the KA blender blades are blunt.",0
4906,I think this coffee pot is awesome!!!!. I have owned my percolator for about two or three years now.  I've never had any trouble with the plastic top breaking off - don't know if other people just happened to get defective models or what and have never had trobule getting the lid off ever.  You just grab the top handle which is made for this purpose - again maybe some other people got a bad model.  The only downside I've found is that my guests will get to the pot first and pour their coffee with the grounds still in the basket - yum - crunchy!!  So dump them\ basket out quickly!,0
4907,"Did I get the only one of these that works?. I love my oil mister sprayer thingy.Pour the oil in, pump the cap about 5 times, and a fine mist comes out.  No, it's not a lot of oil that comes out each spray, but enough to coat a 15+ inch frypan to grill quesadillas or grilled cheese sandwiches on.  I used to use butter for this task, but no more.It's absolutely perfect for coating your pan in an instance where you would use butter or 'pam' cooking spray.  No, it's not going to get a whole cookie sheet in one spraying, but I think its well worth the extra pump",0
4908,Great Buy. Love the way the mattress pad works... no leaks... but even better it's comfortable and QUIET ... no crinkly sounds like a vinyl cover... Very comfy and unnoticable!  Only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 was washing... when removed from the washer it's very heavy... I was afraid to dry it... although it did dry fine... so no concerns there either,0
4909,"Pretty Happy. I have two little boys and somehow, my spoons seem to disappear.  I am sure some dig of my home in a million years will have people wondering if we worshiped utensils.  Anyway.  I am pretty happy with this set. I didn't fall in love with it, but for the price I think is is wonderful.  It has a sturdy feel to it and washes in the dishwasher well.  There isn't much difference in the size of the dinner and salad fork and the same with the spoons, but I do think it was a great buy for the price and would recommend to others",0
4910,"Great Crate- but be careful with teething puppies. the crate is overall nice, light, convenient to setup and fold for transport. The pockets are great and handy to keep clutter out of sight. the only criticism would be the mesh on the sides isn't bulletproof strong, seems to be a tough coated plastic mesh but my bulldog who is teething was able to chew a small hole through it which if she continues, would render the crate unusable, if your dog is not a chewer it's a great product, if he/she is, be wary of this or just spray bitter apple on it. After i did she has stopped.",0
4911,"Best Coffee Mug out there.  Period. I've always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for:1.  Keeps the beverage hot for hours.2.  When sealed, it does not leak at all.3.  Easy to drink from and dribble-free.4.  Suitable for right and left hand drinkers.5.  Fits into most car cup holders.6.  Clips to straps/loops/handles to carry easily, even when filled.7.  Easy to clean and stays stain/smell free.8.  Rubber accents provide non-slip grips and doesn't make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table.9.  High quality construction for durability.10. It looks really cool!This mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug.  I look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug.  Finally, a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user.  This is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price",0
4912,"Save your pennies !!!!!!!. Like all of the coper-core pieces from All-Clad, this is a beauty.I used to think people who spent ""so much"" on cookware were INSANE.If you actually use this pan every day (and you can)......and turn out consistently delightful meals (and you will)......for every dish that turns out as you had hoped, pop one penny in a jar (you can find them everywhere if you look, my kids do!) and by a years time(1 cent a day) you will have saved enough to go and get another of these delightful pans!The flat cooking surface of this pan is actually just a tad larger than the 13"" braiser and the overall interior diameter and height of the domed lid is just a tad smaller.  (Imeasured side by side)I got 10  2"" thick lamb chops into this pan.  Seared em', deglazed then added the magic ingredients, popped in the oven with lid and braised.Delicious!!!!!!Sautese = higher sides makes good for frying chicken - if you doBraiser = probablly better for a larger quantity but even that might not be so because while the braisers sides flare out they are shorter.  The sautese sides go straight up and are higher.All depends on what you are cooking I supposeAlso the sautese has a lip around the edge which helps in pouring without dripping.Lastly it is roughly $25 lessMay all your meals be joyous!",0
4913,"Calphalon Simply Skillet. This is the best skillet we have ever used for high heat usage.  It conducts heat evenly in all areas, is heavy, substantal fry pan (similar to cast iron) without the downside rusting, sticking etc.  Even though it is not advertised as non-stick, we have had no problem with sticking, without the problems of tefelon scratching and flakes coming off the surface during high heat use.  We plan to replace other pans with Calphalon in the future if this one continues to provide the service indicated. Review based on 1 month of hard usage.",0
4914,Convient storage. The product shipped great.  Only problem was that one lid did not come with a seal on it so it had to be returned.  The colors are great and the storage is good.,0
4915,"excellent coffe maker. This coffee maker is perfect for our office - especially the automatic feature.  The coffee maker we had previously was a ""pour-over"" type - no one wanted to be bothered making the coffee when they took the last cup - now its so much more convenient!  The hot water spout is really a nice feature for those who drink tea, hot chocolate or cup a soup for lunch.  We have been very pleased with this machine and would recomend it",0
4916,"Good Value, Large Capacity. Works as advertised. A bit larger than anticipated but otherwise has met my expectations. I haven't had any issues with the filtering.If you don't need a large capacity check out T-Fal's smaller capacity EZ-Clean.I mostly fry fish, chicken, french fries, onion rings, and occasionally burritos/chimichangas",0
4917,"Good value. If you are terrible at making rice as I am, this is a very helpful product.  The liquid tends to boil over if cooked at high temp in my microwave.  I cook the rice at 50% power for about 50% longer than the directions recommend and it comes out perfectly.  Easy clean up in the dishwasher.  It is a bit of a pain to store, but I'd buy it again.  Also comes with a steamer insert for cooking vegetables, etc. but I haven't tried that yet",0
4918,"Great Cooking Experience. Wow, 90 bucks for a pot seems kinda hefty but this sucker really is worth it.  Packaging was good, came fast and I've used it 4 times already in the past two weeks. This is not only for cooking moroccan food but others as well.  Meats prepared on stovetop for 2 - 2.5 hours are incredibly tender and juicy, based over and over again with the lid shape designed the way it is. So far did beef, chicken, pork and gonna do a turkey breast later this week and I cant wait. I love it and leave it on my counter top cause I love the way it looks too! Seems pretty solid, i forgot I left it in the oven and had it pre-heating at 425 for an hour.  Seems to be quite sturdy too",0
4919,Georgeous color. The color is quite pretty under food and garnishes show up nicely. This is a nice size for serving about anything for a smaller dinner party,0
4920,"Best coffee!. Love it!  Bought several for friends.  Definitely buy the beans and a grinder, a huge difference between this and drip",0
4921,"Multi Small Pet Friendly. I love the Catit Fountain - I have 2 cats and a rabbit and they can all drink out of it at the same time.  The bunny and young cat prefer the dome and my older cat prefers the bowl part so there is abundant harmony at the water bowl.  It is very easy to clean (I do it about once a week in the dishwasher), much quieter than the Drinkwell and comes (when I got it) with a hard cord cover making it particularly bunny friendly",0
4922,"Love this mitt, and oh that magnet!. Love this silicone oven mitt.  I have had no issues with heat conductivity and it is extremely resistant to stains.  Also love the magnet that allows for refrigerator hanging.  All in all, just a great item that I use all the time. Great colors, too",0
4923,"The cost is worth it. I do think it's a bit overpriced, but it works very well.  Much better than a hose you have to hook up to a faucet",0
4924,"Astounding value. I would not even say ""for the price""; this is simply an excellent, very firm, well-made pillow. For this sort of quality of materials and manufacture one normally pays several times this price--and everyone loves a bargain",0
4925,"Didnt Use To Be A Coffe Drinker, But Now... My sister purchased this item for my wife for Christmas of 2005, since she was the coffee drinker in the family. In the last year, I have gone from not drinking coffe at all, to making at least 4 mugs a week (14oz setting). I don't agree with any of the negative reviews this machine has received.I have put a cup of coffe brewed with this machine up against various brews from [national chain name omitted] and prefer the brew from this Balck & Decker 9 times out of 10 (they do make a few great lattes).--ConsOnly thing I can think to mention is that the resivior only holds enough for 2 brews on the 14 oz setting, but that is enough for my wife and I to have a full mug each morning.--ProsFast brew.Great serving sizes.Easy to fill and clean.This is simply some of the best coffee I have tasted",0
4926,"Tough little booger. I put this clock on my wedding registry cause I liked the look of it and it seemed sturdy....and boy is it! My husband and I are stationed in Spain and over here, the kitchen walls are solid tile from floor to ceiling. I wanted this clock in my kitchen so I baught some sticky-hooks to hang it with, thinking that two should hold it. Well, twice (you'd think I'd have learned the first time) it fell off the wall, bounced off the counter (after first completely shattering a dish...wow) and to the floor, sliding accross the kitchen. I was surprise to see it was not only still working but had just a minor scratch on the metal! This is a tough little booger and I would definitely buy another one. Plus, the warranty is very good. And, I finally got it mounted firmly to my kitchen wall....yea",0
4927,"handy Kitchen tool. For small amounts, no need to haul out the big food processor.  I use this all the time.  Perfect for salsa's and for mincing onions and garlic for dishes",0
4928,great for dips. I love this smaller crockpot for dips of any kind. My family has food at every get together and having this 2 1/2 quart crockpot is perfect. It makes cleaning up easier too,0
4929,"It works. Unlike so many spot cleaners on the market for carpeting, this one really works.  Try it, you'll like it especially if you have animals, children or a very messy husband.",0
4930,"A Functional Piece of Art. The toaster is beautiful and works beautifully.  No preheating.  No need to watch.  Just set the timer and push the lever.  The only drawback is that it gets a bit hot while in use, but I suppose all chrome toasters are like that.  Makes perfectly consistent toast every time.  Finally, it looks *magnificent*.  Pricey, but you are acquiring an objet d'art in your kitchen",0
4931,"A must have!. These are easy to use, they do not make a mess, and offer vibrant colors.   They do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can.  I would  highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate",0

4933,"great cap. i received this for my birthday and i must say, i haven't had a problem with it.  it's a lot of fun... especially hearing the pressure steam froth the milk!  it did leak on me once, the first time i used it, but i did not tighten the two halves together as best i could.  when i did tighten the two halves, i had no problems and it made great coffee.  i'm excited to see how it seasons up and the better coffee it is supposed to make the more i use it",0
4934,"Good Waffle Iron. This waffle iron browns evenly, and the browning scale is accurate.  An added bonus is its easy storage because it stands on end and will fit into a cupboard",0
4935,"Convenient & Inexpensive. I love this hamper.  Even when it is full of laundry, it does not tip over, the handles make it easy for me to carry downstairs to the laundry room, it callapses if I don't need it and stores easily, it's inexpensive and has free shipping.  Plus, it doesn't take up lots of space, and vents so wet towels don't mold other clothes in the hamper.  It's perfect for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a hamper",0
4936,"clean classy design. I've owned this flatware in this pattern for three years.  I paid top dollar for each place setting, so this price is exceptional.  The picture of the flatware here doesn't do it justice.  You have to see it and feel it in your hand to truly appreciate the quality and craftsmanship.  The combination of shiny and brushed metal is both eye-catching and elegant.  It's a clean and classy design.  We use this flatware year-round. The hostess set is nice too, but the serving spoons have such large bowls they are slightly goofy looking",0
4937,"Outstanding. We received this as a gift from our wedding registry. Easy to season, it comes with clear instructions for seasoning (and cleaning).  It also came with a slim cookbook.  Quite helpful, since we'd never used a wok.  Now we can't get enough of using it!  Great quality for a very low price.",0

4940,"Great piece for the money - gets lots of compliments. I was a little skeptical about ordering a piece of furniture online -- would it arrive scuffed up or broken? -- but I was very glad I took the risk with the console table.  I had seen it long ago in a Target store, but they have since stopped selling it in stores.  It was as nice as I remembered it being when I saw it in person.Other than a very minor flaw in the finish on the top of the table -- which I don't think was an issue with shipping or handling -- it arrived in perfect condition.  Everyone who has been to my house since I bought it has commented on what a great piece of furniture it is.One thing to note:  the drawers are very shallow, so don't expect for them to hold bulky items like remote controls.",0

4944,"I LOVE this machine. I love it I love it I love it. My mom let me use this machine and now I'm the official ""ice cream maker"" in the house. Clean up is really easy even for a kid. You just pour a quart of warm water in the funnel lid  but make sure it is closed because this machine has an interlock feature that stops the machine from operating when the lid is not engaged just flip the mix switch and use the lever to drain out the soapy water. I made vanilla ice cream from an episode I saw on Good Eats it was so smooth and you control the amount of overrun this is the only machine on the market that lets you do this....light ice cream for the kids and sinfully rich ice cream for your parents. Store bought ice cream doesn't stand a chance against this machine. Try it ...you'll love it!",0

You can use your raclette for desert, pizza, breakfast....and much more! Traditionally served with steamed red potatoes....this will satisfy the ""meat and potatoe"" man in the group.  Marinade the meat with different flavors...to add some spice.  Don't forget the vegetables....slice onion, red peppers, mushrooms, romas...and even pineapple. It's a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends.  Extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot",0
4946,"Moroccan cooking. I am very pleased overall w/ this product.  My husband is Moroccan and we cook tagines probably 5 times a week.  We had been previously using a very small clay tagine from Morocco and needed a larger size.  We have cooked a wide array of foods in this tagine and are very happy w/ all the results.  Not to mention, it also looks wonderful displayed on our range top when not in use.  The heat is evenly distributed and the steam is circulated well in the conical lid.  The one thing I would do to enhance this product is to create a small hole for venting.  For now, we prop it open on occasion w/ a wooden spoon.  We have requested the smaller (9.5"") tagine for a gift.",0

Now that the weather is nice, it is great to get everyone together and have everyone make their own pizzas.I disagree with Tom: The thermometer on my high end Weber never seems to match the temperature that the Pizza Grill does, probably because the location is higher or something. Getting tiles from home depot can be dangerous for 2 reasons; they could have lead or other poisons that would leach out at high temperature. Or they would just crack.",0
4948,Very Classy. I purchased the wine cooler and ice bucket as gifts for my mother-in-law. I was surprised by how light in weight they were (which was a good thing for my mother-in-law). They certainly are Lenox quality and the price on Amazon was outlet store pricing. The only draw back is that there is not a set of tongs for the ice bucket. And choosing a set of tongs turned out to be time consuming... I recommend the Onieda silicone tipped ones. They were very classy and actually worked better than regular tongs. The only somewhat drawback is the color choices offered for the tongs.,0
4949,Great little whisk. This is a fantastic little whisk.  It is perfect for whipping up hot chocolate or other drink mixes & also to scramble eggs.  It is a must have in the kitchen for those little tasks that are too small for a big whisk.,0
4950,Excellent Coat Rack. I purchased this coat rack as a replacement for one that was similar in color and style because it had broken.  I couldn't be happier with the product I received and I am sure that it will last just as long as the other one that I had.  A great buy,0
4951,"Great For Daily Use - Nott Made For Heavy Duty Cleaning. I read the reviews before I purchased this machine. I know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of. So with this in mind I will put in my 2 cents.I have had my machine for two months and I use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults, a 4 year old and two dogs. Generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket.You must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease.The machine is set up to auto-shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low. I agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine. A powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive. I see what Hoover was trying to do with this machine. They were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine. They gave it a good shot but for all of us clean-freaks this machine doesn't quite hit the mark.The water/cleaning solution section is, in my humble opinion, to small. I run out of water quickly and I have a very small kitchen. But the good news is that my kitchen is so small I can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up. :)One more comment before I give my final review...remember to follow the instructions and use ONLY the kind of cleaners Hoover recommends. There's a reason for this. If you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die! The grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets.So my final opinion is this. If you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it's a great time saver. It's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac-up of dog hair, scrub and mop. Any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment, mop and bucket routine. If you are a cleanfreak, like me, you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand-and-knees scrub. No machine will ever leave you satisfied. This machine was definately NOT made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it's great.I am giving this machine 4 stars because I think it does what it was designed to do...light cleaning. I would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice.When Hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum, scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards I'll be all over it! Until then, I'll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month.",0
4952,"Makes Tastey Food. Burgers and chicken tastes great after cooking it on this pan.  Can't use the round grill press though - too big.  If you cook meat on the pan until its well-done, you will have to put a bit of water in it to soak before washing.  It can be difficult to wash; but, I still like this pan.",0

4954,"Handy Little Product. I really like this product!  It's small size makes it very portable and the display is easy to operate.  Works well with bowls, but a little tougher to use with plates unless you raise the plate slightly with some sort of stand and adjust for the additional weight.  Thank heavens for the HOLD feature",0
4955,HEPA Air Purifier. The air purifier arrived in a timely fashion. So far so good,0
4956,"Love it!. I bought this mixer for my dad. I have a Kitchenaid but the reviews liked this model better for bread making, my dad's passion, I agree. He is really happy with it and I used it last weekend and I love it. It is great and bonus, $100 cheaper than the Kitchenaid. It would be nice if it had the capability for some grinder, pasta, etc, attachments but really, I buy my sausage and pasta so.....",0
4957,Wonderful. I just purchased this set and LOVE it.  I have been looking for a stainless steel salt and pepper shaker for some time but didn't want to pay a premium price. This fit the bill and as a bonus I got a cocoa and cheese shaker as well.  The large size makes them easy to handle while cooking and they make a stylish piece placed on the stove top. I don't believe they will clog any worse than the average salt & pepper shakers as all will clog when exposed to moisture. The bottom hole for filling is easy and convenient.For the money they are an excellent buy,0
4958,"great. My daughter bought this for me for Christmas.  She  down loaded  pictures of all my grandkids  on it.  I just love it.  Easy to carry around  and  you can  add or detract old photos .  A must for anyone  who likes to  show off  children, grandchildren  or pets",0
4959,"A great dish for many uses. Im not much of a baker, Ok, who are we kidding, I dont bake. However I have used the devil out of this dish, I make hot appetizer dips in it, I use it as a serving bowl, I have filled it with water and floated flowers in it as a center piece.I rabidly collect fiesta ware and recommend this as a great additional piece. Mine is Sunflower Yellow",0
4960,"Nice in many ways. I bought this for my wife and I to use a few months ago.  We were looking for something to cook in that was between the 4qt. and 8qt. size.  At first I just wanted a new pot, then when I saw this I took a chance - and I'm glad I did!  We use this almost every day.  I have slow-cooked meats in it, cooked pasta, casseroles and soups along with dozens of other items.  I don't often deep fry, but the few times that I have I have enjoyed this cooker.  I especially like the extra room it offers over most ""dedicated fryers"".I can cook enough for all five kids and still only have one easy pot to clean!  What more do you want",0
4961,"Now I can rest!. Cooking breakfast for 11 can get hectic, but with the Cool Touch grill, my 10 year old grandaughter enjoys making the pancakes and French toast. Of course, she has supervision, but we can make many items at once making my mornings easier when my children are home to visit",0
4962,aerolatte. Great for whipping up hot chocolate....my little granddaughter just loves it and so do I!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
4963,"Dyson DC 15. Great product.  Works very well.  Only down side is that it is very loud.  Much louder than any other vacuum that I have tried.  The unit is also heavy, which my wife dislikes.",0
4964,Outstanding Hotdog Cooker. This machine cooks hotdogs like the ones you used to get at the county fairs.  The hotdogs are hot and the buns are hot.  I would not give up my cooker for anything,0
4965,"Stylish. I just got into wine a little while ago, and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home, rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler.  But seeing as how I'm anywhere near wine snob status, I didn't want to spend a bunch on a set.Enter the Riedel O glasses.  They were on sale, great price for two glasses.  They arrived and I'm happy with them.  They're sophisticated enough to be wine glasses, but without the stems, they're not snobby either.  I would have given this 5 stars, but one of the glasses I received has a minor imperfection along the rim, almost a little bubble of glass, or crystal.  Other than that, they're great",0
4966,"Fabulous!. This is one of the little items that makes a big difference. I am not a gadget person. I like a lean, clean kitchen. This splatter screen helps with the clean! I can't believe how well it works and how well it fits on any size pan. Get one...you'll love it",0
4967,Classy and Beautiful!. The set is so beautiful!  It is the perfect color and style for our new house!  We love how it is simple and still classy enough for formal dining!  I love this and it's a great deal!  I would recommend this set to anyone!  It's perfect,0
4968,"My favorite vacuum container. We have this container in constant use in the refrigerator, holding prewashed/precut veggies for snacking.  I find it easier to pack food into than our assorted tall, round canisters.  It has actually improved our nutrition because the clear container with colorful veggies all ready to eat is the most beautiful thing in the refrigerator.  And the veggies stay all nice and fresh and crunchy - no more slimy pepper strips!The only downside is that you can't stack anything on top of the domed lid.  I don't use the cheese grater",0
4969,Quick service on belt. The belt was received very quickly and we were very satisfied with it.Donna Wilso,0
4970,Great BBQ. I bought this for my husband's birthday and he has been having a great time using it ever since.  He never cooks except on the grill outside so now he can use this inside during the winter.  He seems to be really enjoying using it and creating new things. (And that means I don't have to cook that night).  I recommend this BBQ.,0
4971,Very cool. I think this tem is very well priced and very nice for dog,0
4972,"Well worth the price. I bought this pillow because I wasn't completely satisfied with another foam pillow that I bought, nor was my husband. This thing is great. My husband liked it so much that I ordered him one too. They hold their shape better. The only reason I didn't give these pillows 5 stars is because they aren't quite high enough for us but we just use the other foampillows we bought to raise them a bit and sleep better than before",0
4973,"Excellent quality grinds!. I bought this grinder from my local coffee house on the recommendation of several of the employees at the shop. I've had it for almost 6 months and I couldn't be happier. I have used several other burr grinders, all of which have produced far more coffee dust than I would like. I use a press pot, so I use fairly coarse grinds, and the consistency of the grinds from this machine are perfect. I haven't had any problems with the grinder not functioning. The same button that turns it on turns it right back off. I honestly don't care how loud it is, as I would expect a coffee grinder to be loud. It is not difficult to clean at all. I just use the included bristle cleaner and a moist paper towel, it only takes a couple of minutes",0
4974,"Zojirushi Thermal Carafe. I just recently received this carafe and am VERY pleased with it.  So far, it has kept our coffee piping hot for over 15 hours.  I love the design and the swivel base.  We have used the glass-lined plastic carafes in the past, and they just don't keep the coffee very hot.  The Zojirushi Thermal Carafe is well worth the price.  Excellent product",0
4975,"It works!!. Surprisingly, this vented plastic storage container actually keeps bread fresh. Pricey little devil ;-",0
4976,"Classy,  yet durable. These ramekins are perfect for flan, custard, pudding, and the like.  They are beautiful, yet very heavy duty.  After buying one set in cherry red, I bought another set in flame 2 weeks later.  These are a definate must buy",0
4977,"against conventional wisdom advice. I'm going against what many home chefs like in an all purpose knife.It's not heavy, German, or made of surgical stainless steel.These are light knives, picking them up is effortless. If you uses knives often, why get something heavy that promotes carpal tunnel syndrome?They are not German. I think German knives are overated and overpriced. These knives are a great bargain. You can get 2 whole sets for the cost of one henckels or wusthoff knife.I admit the cheaper steel they use in these knives do not hold their edge as long nor can you dishwash (always handwash these). These knives rust if you throw them in the machine but they are very easy to sharpen and can get ridiculously sharp using those cheap 2 stage knife sharpeners.As long as you handwash and sharpen periodically, you can cut with the best of them.The secret to caring for your knife is to handwash, a light oil cloth, and sharpen your knives periodically.",0
4978,"Nice craftsmanship and functional, too. This knife block is very well made, looks nice and fits my knives.  Only a few of my knives are Henckels but even the others fit nicely",0
4979,"Just what I wanted!. Thank you for offering this wonderful product, oh I have other juicers etc, but wanted this after searching and looking at wooden ones",0
4980,"Super Soft. These sheets are fabulous, very soft, even after washing. I love em, and the color is beautiful",0
4981,"Great for cleaning grout. I bought this steamer primarily for cleaning grout and it worked!!!! It took a little bit of scrubbing along with the steam but the grout looks like new. However, my grout was only two years old, so it may or may not work as well with older grout. Overall I think this machine is a great value for the price.",0
4982,"I like it, but a pain to keep clean. I really like popcorn and I really like this popper.  Perfrect popcorn everytime and very, very few unpopped kernels.  The butter drip on the top is a nice idea, but it doesn't work very well.  I can't taste the butter when I use this method, so I don't.  The only downside, and I think this would probably be true of any oil based popper, is that it is a pain to clean.  You have to put the cover and the stirring mechanism in the dish washer to get it truly clean and if you have a dishwasher with a heating element in the bottom that is going to warp the cover unless you can somehow fit this large item on the top shelf",0
4983,great deal. Great deal and even better product. Lightening fast and easy on the eyes,0
4984,beautiful. I am a big fan of the Royal Albert collection. This particular piece is a beautiful addition to my collection. I am quite satisfied with my purchase,0
4985,"Performs exactly as described. This item performs exactly as was described in any of the marketing information I read.  That, in and of itself, is something to be happy about.  Keeps coffee hot up to 36 hours, is easy to disassemble and clean, and the Stainless Steel is well worth the extra $$. The last one I had was aluminum, and it became dulled and dirty looking over time.  This one looks new all the time",0
4986,"Wonderful Desk!. This desk is awesome! It is made out of SOLID WOOD not the cheap pressed cork wood from cheaper `discount' products.  Trust the saying ""You get what you paid for..."" and for this case this is a good buy. The shipping was fast it took about 5 days to come by UPS.  Despite the box the desk came in was beaten up the parts of the desk inside where in great condition.The desk needs assembly and the instruction booklet took a while to figure since it was mostly pictures. Each part was labeled well so it was very easy to put together and I did it with out using any power tools and it took me about an hour to finish the job.The style of the desk is very nice for small apartments. It sits against the wall and doesn't take up a lot of space.  I would defiantly recommend buying this desk especially if you want a desk that isn't bulky and solidly built.",0
4987,"Astoundingly clean and useful. This is the best tool for dismantling a whole chicken.  Safer than a knife, and you can take it apart (easily!) and put it in the dishwasher to disinfect.  And then reassemble it easily (in 1 second!).  I use it also for trimming fat off of pork, lamb, beef, etc., and it's invaluable for removing extra fins, etc., from fish",0
4988,Works great. This replace one that was 10 years old and also made by Rival. It will see a lot of use and works great,0
4989,Works great!. No more allergic reaction to my friends cat after using this air cleaner! Surprised the heck out of me but it beats my Ionic Breeze by a mile at a fraction of the cost. Allergy season is upon us so I'm ordering another one tomorrow along with some extra filters. It's just great finding an inexpensive solution to a miserable affliction,0
4990,love it. I love it.  A great purchase.  Quality and function.   Makes me smile,0
4991,"Nice personal coffee maker. I read the reviews before I ordred this and was a little leary (because of drips and after taste) but ordered it anyway.  Let me say that I love my new coffee maker. I really like the fact that the pot has a lid that you can drink from. You don't have to dirty another coffee cup. Some others reported that it drips when you drink but I have not had that happen to me. I followed the manufacturers instructions to put a vinegar and water solution through it a couple of times before the first use and have not experienced the plastic after taste some people reported. The top is a little bit hard to take off to add condiments but can be done with a little practice. It is a little bit large to take with you in the car. It does come with an attachment so that it fits down in a drink holder but my car has flip up covers on them and they get in the way of this fitting down in completely but I've used it anyway with some success. Most importantly, it makes excellent coffee. Glad I bought it",0
4992,"quality construction, good performance, looks nice, great price. I purchase this unit refurbished for $120 about 10 days ago.  I held off writing a review until I used it for a bit.  So far my overall impression is very good.  I feel I received a good value buying the refurbished product.  To be completely honest I'm not sure my unit was even used once.  The exterior of the box had a lot of wear, but inside the box everything seemed brand new.  I smelled the burrs and there was no coffee smell at all.  Was it even used?It works very well.  I have noted the same minor complaints as others.  Mostly that the bottom glass jar feels like I could break it simply by holding it in my hand, and there is always a pinch of mess after grinding no matter what you do.  I have one other minor issue to add to this list.  When grinding there is a small row of beans that do not drop down into the grinder.  They get stuck along the ridge of the glass at the top.  I have to leave it running and try knocking them all down.  This isn't really all that bad of a thing to deal with, but I'd prefer to walk away and come back to all beans completely ground.I have found a way to minimize the mess when you pull out the bottom container with fresh ground coffee in it.  Leave the unit running even though all beans have been ground.  Then rock/slide the bottom jar back and fourth to jiggle the plastic plate where the grounds fall out through.  When I do this I get a lot of extra grounds that fall through into the jar.  A lot more than I'd expect.  Then I shut off the unit and pull out the jar.  The mess is significantly reduced.  Just a few crumbs instead of a small pile.I can't speak for life span of the unit.  As others have noted, it feels very solid and of a high quality construction.  If someone were to break into the house you better believe I'd be reaching for this grinder.  Heck.. I might use it as an anvil when I need to do metal work.I gave this a 4 star rating.  I reserve 5 stars for a product that is perfect.  If KitchenAid beefed up the glass thickness in the lower jar to match the upper bean hopper, did something about the slight mess, and removed the ridge in the upper hopper so all beans are ground I would have rated this a 5",0
4993,"Stylish yet Useful. We bought this kennel for our Shih tzu puppy, and she just loves it.  The floor mat is soft yet easy to clean, and the multiple zippered mesh openings allow us to access her from several sides or roll up the mesh so she can get in and out on her own.  It comes with handy zippered pockets for toys or treats, and one large pocket detaches from the kennel to form a bag with a detachable leash - great for travel.  The kennel is lightweight so it's easy to move around, although we don't fold it up frequently (it was a bit harder to unfold and open up than we expected, but once it was open, it was very sturdy for a small dog).  Larger or more aggressive dogs might chew through the canvas material so you'd want to  be careful in matching this choice to the temperament of your pet.  I'd rate this a 5 if it weren't for that concern",0
4994,"Nice, no complains. I like the nice pink trio pattern, and the price isn't bad at all ($1.99).  Looks cool so far.  Bought it 2 months ago, and it's not stained or damaged yet",0
4995,"Very nice, solid roasting rack. This rack is very nice and heavy-duty.  I cooked an 18lb turkey on it with ease.  The non-stick coating seems durable enough for the purpose and the rack is plenty large and heavy enough.  The only reason I am giving it four instead of five stars is that the piece could have easily been made even sturdier by using a few more welds.  There are a number of points on the rack where the metal rods simply touch one-another and are not welded.  While the rack held my 18lb turkey with no problems, it seems to me that two or three more spot welds by the manufacturer would greatly increase the durability of the item.  That being said- it is the sturdiest rack I have found so far",0
4996,Quality. Riedel is always a quality product.  You can never go wrong with them.,0
4997,Quality product!. This is a great curtain.  It's listed as a liner but I use it as the shower curtain itself.  It's heavier than most and not stiff so it hangs really well.  The ring holes have metal gromets so it will last without the holes tearing.  This curtain also resists the cloudy water-deposit film that ruins most curtains.  A great quality product,0
4998,"Great option at first, motor seems to lose power after a while. 03/29/2007 update:  OK, I have had this for a couple of months now, and I have started to see the problems other people have mentioned.  The rake is not powerful enough to take the waste to the disposal container and I end up scooping it like a normal litter.  I also purchased the larger size at the same time and that one has not had this problem.  Either that one has a different component or the quality control of these and deviations in production make the power behind the motor really variable depending on which unit you get.  Buy the small size at your own risk.   I would downgrade this to a 1 star at this point but they don't have that option once it's submitted.Previous Review:  I used to have the old model over 7 years ago when they first came out, but the rake was not detachable and made cleaning very difficult.One of my 4 cats is very picky about her litter and I decided to give this new model, which easily detaches for cleaning, a try.  I have had it for a week with no problems (and this with 4 cats).I have left the old litter boxes (2) just in case, but they seem to prefer this for the number ones.  I think they like deeper fill for number twos, which is one negative, you can only put in the litter about 1 1/2 inches deep.So far no problems with the rake getting stuck, although I think I might get a mega sized one next since it seems a little short where they are always going right at the very end in the corner",0

5000,"The best canner/pressure cooker I've owned... I do lots of cooking and canning - sometimes just for family, sometimes for large gatherings - and this cooker has made that chore much easier.  Even when cooking for family, I'll make 2 chickens at a time, that way I won't have to cook another night.  While the chickens are cooking, I'll also have stock to make rice or soup with.  Forgot about cooking dinner?  This baby can take 2 frozen rabbits from the freezer to the dinner table in less than an hour.  Its large size makes canning large batches quick work.  The only drawback I have is washing it - it is heavy, and if you don't have a big enough sink or a hose to rinse it out, then your in for a workout.  I have a double sink and it fits in nicely - a must for anyone with a large family",0
5001,"Very pretty and elegant-looking. I finally got iced tea spoons! No more burned, wet fingers from stirring tea with a short spoon. These have a simple, graceful design.

5010,"Perfect size!  The one pan that does it all!. I just received my Le Creuset Casserole a few weeks ago and LOVE it!  I was a little 'on the fence' about the size before I bought it, but I've found that it's the perfect size.  I've used it as intended (making a casserole), but I've also been able to use it in place of my skillet.  The pan is nice and wide, and I've been able to brown 6 chicken breasts in it.  The lid is nice and heavy, with a tight fit.  I cooked and simmered a meat dish in it tonight and it made everything very tender and moist.  This is a very adaptable piece of cookware.  I think I will end up cooking most of my meals in this pan.As most Le Creuset pieces, clean up has been a breeze.  I just let it cool, soak in in a little water, and it wipes clean.  Very easy!As I said before, I am very happy I went with the 3.5 qt. size instead of the larger 5 qt.  I usually cook about 4-6 servings at a time and have found that this works great for us.  I would only suggest the 5 qt size if you are cooking for 8+ on a regular basis",0
5011,"Even my fat cat loves this!. I bought this after I read it was recommended by the author of ""Cat vs. Cat"".  I have 3 cats - a stuck-up prissy female, an obese lazy female, and a psychotic energetic male.  I love this thing!  I am so amazed and very happy that all 3 of them love this toy!  My stuck-up cat usually never plays with cat toys, only strings, pens, and straws.  My fat cat just never plays, but is obsessed with watching out the window and talking to birds.  The male, however, was born in a feral cat colony, but bottle fed by my step-sister.  He has endless energy.  Before I even got DA Bird out of its package he was excited (the other two were sleeping).  We started playing, and soon the fat one came downstairs to see what was going on.  Before long, I had my two females playing with it, having put the male in a room.The only thing you might want to consider is if you have a cat who is over possessive or wild, he/she may destroy the feathers before a normal cat would.  My male cat was so nuts over this, he actually was tiring himself out to the point of panting.  The problem is when he would actually catch Da Bird, he will not let go and growls, so the other cats don't want to play.  Really, if you think about it, wild cats (and some domestic) catch birds then take them off to eat, but as long as you don't allow them to get to aggressive with it, you should be fine.I definitely recommend this toy.  Be sure you keep this somewhere your cats can't find it when you aren't playing with them.",0
5012,"Nice color. This tablecloth is a little stiff, so the folds don't really come out even after it's been on the table for a few weeks. Otherwise, it feels like other vinyl tablecloths I've had. The color is light and neutral -- a warm beige with a tiny weave pattern. For the price, it's useful and nice looking. I keep these on the table where we read newspapers, so after a tablecloth gets too much printer's ink on it, I replace it",0

I had a cat ""accident"" in a very cramped area in my basement that ended up causing a very nasty smell in our basement and part of our house upstairs.  We put it near the location of the ""accident"" and ran it on the ""quick clean"" mode for a few hours and then in standard mode the rest of that day and the following day.  The smell diminished substantially over that time.  Operates fairly quietly.  Only complaint is cost of filter refills (are they really worth 8 bucks?)",0

It even works in making Beef Carpaccio with the standard blade.

The VariTilt is worth the extra price because the slices fall away from the blade instantly",0

The power in this thing does fill the filter quickly but I appreciate them because they help keep my allergies away. When the filter is clean it is also a little bit loud. But the noise means you're being productive (apparently the industry isn't using space age insulation and noise reduction just yet). I own two of these and am thinking of buying a third,0

5026,"Marvelous Steamer ! ! !. I ordered this item when my American Tourister steamer (also made by Franzus) began leaking after more than *20 years* of faithful service both on the road and here at home.  I had been looking for several weeks since I'm pretty picky about my appliances.  This steamer has exceeded my expectations in every category.  It must have been designed by someone who actually uses the product--it is efficient, well-designed, easy to use, and very compact.  The cord is ~8 ft long, making it usable even in those rare large hotel bathrooms where the outlet is far from the shower bar.  The butterfly handle design is easier to use than other steamers on the market, affording level grip even to a jet-lagged traveller.  The handles fold well flat against the body of the steamer.  Comes with a brush head that I haven't tried yet (forgot to put it on the steamer while it was cool), and a drawstring bag for easy storage & packing.  I am **thrilled** with this steamer !!!  It's even better than the older version that I loved, obviously the company has paid attention to detail & continued to improve their product.  I was so happy to find this is made by Franzus since I already know their high-quality based on the long life on my last Franzus-made steamer. The Micro Pro also steamed clothing wrinkle-free in less time than my old model.  Great for at-home use too if you're like me and HATE to iron.  Saves your fabric while making clothes look fresh from the cleaners or the dryer.  I rate this Franzus Micro Pro Steamer a 5+++ for its compact good looks, clever features, and easy usability.  Franzus thought of everything.  If you've been shopping for a steamer--look no further !!",0

5029,"Good starter juicer. This was my first juicer and I felt it was a good buy.I do not know if this model comes in appliance white yet, but the black is attractive and it can be left out on a counter if you have all black appliances without detracting from the look of your kitchen.The juicer was easy to set up and use even without reading the manual. Very similar to food processor. It comes well packed.When running the juicer, the noise level is quieter than a dishwasher or blender. Perhaps not as quiet as a Krups ice cream maker, but certainly acceptable middle ground.It comes with a cleaning brush that works well to scrub the metal inner piece that strains the juice. I do wish it came with a smaller one to get in the spout of the juicer to clean that area. A baby bottle nipple brush will have to do. This is the only part I wash by hand. The rest can be rinsed and put through the dishwasher.If you line the pulp container with a grocery bag, clean up is easy. Just take the bag out! The pulp it makes is relatively fine and moist. You can use this in baking or add it to your compost.The juice container holds 2 cups, but it could be improved by adding measure lines to it.I bought this primarily to juice for my 3 year old daughter to help keep her palate open to produce tastes. She enjoys putting things in the chute and turning it on. Our first combo was equal parts carrot and apple.Citrus seems to get a little messier than other items, but it is still easy to clean up.I would reccommend this to a friend",0

Overall, this is a nice set of barstools and can really add a bit of flair and style to a bar or counter",0

I am sold on these and am about to order them for  a number of my friends.  They will get frequent use in my kitchen",0
5036,"Knife sharpening is not a dull subject... After my wife complained that our kitchen knives were getting too dull to use, I set out to find a good knife sharpener for household use. I researched a bit and found several options - both manual and electric. One name that kept popping up was ""Chef's Choice"" and I noticed very few negative comments on their models. Having both a discount coupon and gift certificate from Bed, Bath & Beyond - I decide to make my decision there. Unfortunately, there wasn't any sales staff knowledgeable about knife sharpeners and I had to go it alone. It was there that I first noticed the Waring KS80 Professional Sharpener. With it's black and stainless finish - it was definitely more attractive than the plain white Chef's Choice - but, it was somewhat more expensive retailing at $100. I settled for the Chef's Choice 110, took it home and was promptly disappointed. On the expensive chef's knife I first tried it on, it left a decidedly sharp but ragged edge on the blade. It looked as though I had tried to sharpen the knife on the sidewalk! I didn't dare try sharpening any other knives and risk leaving such an ugly edge on them. Bed, Bath & Beyond gladly made an exchange for the Waring and I was much more pleased with it's final results - a sharp blade with a more visually-pleasing edge. It even cleaned up the rough edge left by the Chef's Choice. The only disadvantage I have found is that, with most knives, the inch or so of blade nearest the handle cannot be sharpened since the hilt of the knife keeps it from being placed into the sharpener's slots. This, however, is not a major drawback since this area of the blade is not frequently encountered in most uses. The Chef's Choice will cover the entire blade length - but with a very rough finish. I recommend the Waring over the Chef's Choice without reservation - but the Waring is probably a bit too expensive for an appliance that will likely see only a very few uses a year.",0

5054,"Great Glasses. We live in Mexico and therefore drink tequila quite often.  Most Mexicans will tell you that the only way to drink tequila is in a ""caballito"" or shot glass, but these glasses make a big difference, especially when drinking aejos or reposados.  They are tall enough that you can get a good whiff without too much  interference from the alcohol fumes.  The sweet vanilla oak notes of the aejos are especially enhanced by these glasses, but even the grassy, vegetal blancos are more lively than when tasted in a standard shot glass.  My wife, whose hands are much smaller than mine, agreed that the glasses are very well balanced and comfortable to hold.  A great way to ""degustar"" a very noble spirit",0

5061,"This is the only way to drink tequila . . . . . . this glass and, of course, a good tequila. As a resident of Mexico for four years and a tequila obsessive, I have tasted over 70 different tequilas ranging from $5 to $175 per bottle. Riedel's is the only glass that has allowed me fully to smell, taste, and enjoy tequila, and the only glass recognized by the consejo regulador de tequila, Mexico's FDA of the tequila industry. In my quest to enjoy the best tequilas at the lowest prices, I have purchased cheaper wine flutes and just about every other glass that I have been able to find that resembles the Riedel shape; all, however, has been to no avail: This glass's singular construction is unmatched for tequila. Unfortunately, these glasses are not created equal: I have owned 16 of these glasses, and, from time to time, I come across a poorly finished glass--an unsightly stem seam, a rough lip. Moreover, this glass confounds all attempts at describing the color of tequila. Finally, these glasses are not cheap, nor are they very strong--my two-year-old son and I have managed to break twelve already. Nevertheless, this is, at least for the moment, the only way to drink tequila.For those in search of the perfect tequila, I would like to share some recommendations after having spent thousands of dollars in my own search.But before I begin, I wish to urge all tequila drinkers to give serious consideration to boycotting Cuervo and Sauza. These U.S.-owned megacompanies have bought up a huge amount of the agave in Mexico and have consequently had an inordinate influence on the production and price of agave, with Cuervo being especially destructive. Competition has become very difficult for other, less financially powerful producers, who have been going out of business/selling off. Depressing to me was Cuervo's recent acquisition of Don Julio, whose 1942 is among my favorite tequilas. Before you buy from these behemoths, consider what they have done to the Mexican farmers, smaller tequila producers, and the ever-rising price of tequila.Now, on with a few recommendations. Keep in mind that price has been an object for me, and that I have done most of my tasting in Mexico, so I have not been able to try some of the very expensive tequilas or tequilas that are export only. Also, note that I have not included tequilas that are impossible to find in the U.S. In no particular order, then, my recommendations are:1. Azulejos anejo ($90 per bottle? Difficult to find, but worth searching out, this tequila is among the most flavorful and best-balanced (i.e., between agave and oak) anejos that I have tried.2. Don Julio 1942 anejo ($100 per bottle. Okay, it's owned by Cuervo now, it's a bit overpriced, and its flavor strays from agave, but the exceptional complexity is mind-blowing).3. El tesoro de Don Felipe anejo (At $36-40, a strikingly pure- and full-flavored anejo, this tequila is more readily available in the U.S. than in Mexico).4. Chinaco reposado (At around $40 per bottle, a solid, pure tequila, and arguably better than the over-the-top oaky anejo; this tequila has an artesanal flavor).5. Casa Noble reposado (I was able to buy this for around $40-$50 in Mexico until, like an increasing number of tequilas, it  apparently became available only as an export and no longer in Mexico; this tequila sells for around $60 in the U.S. This tequila probably has the best nose of any I've sniffed; unfortunately, however, this tequila has one of those house flavors that permeates every tequila that its fabrica, La Cofradia, makes, and that not everyone will necessarily like).6. Corazon anejo (apparently export-only, selling in the U.S. for anywhere from $47-60. This is one of the better middle-priced tequilas, notable for its balanced and complex flavor, which edges out Don Felipe's).N.B. Perfidio is back in production. I bought a bottle for about $120 in Mexico. Some call this the best tequila ever made, but I found it so carmelized that, as delicious as it was, it ceased seeming to be a tequila. It is, however, worth trying.Enjoy",0
5062,"easy weighing. This is an excellent set of scales. The display is very good, easy to read both in lbs and kg. The tray is a good size and can hold reasonable quantities.

5063,"it's ingenious as a humidifer. It's of course bogus to point out the German social system as reason for the price. A free market is characterized by supply and demand setting the price. I asssume there is a free market in the U.S.?. What you effectively pay for in this humdifier is the idea and patent, not the material. It's the same why an Armani suite costs 2000$ and why Microsoft Office costs more than the CD it is burned on.I have this humidifier now for a year. I am an allergy sufferer and dry air makes it worse. I live in CA.  Thye humidifier extends on the principle of what my Mom always recommended: Put a bowl with water in your room. Since it does not heat the air you don't have problems with overheated air that then condenses on windows etc. The dryer the air the more it will pick up the humidity. It's kind of self regulating.It does the job for me. I measure it and I get usually a jump from 45% to 55% of humidity in my room. I personally think cleaning is very easy. You have to use their cleaner, I do it every 8 weeks or so. It's true there will be mineral deposits on the air cleaner. I wipe them away every 2.5 months. It's not a problem as you can dissassemble this thing completely.I think this is the best humdifier out there. It avoids all the problems of heated humdifiers and it's self regulation is ingenious. I don't believe it does a good job of cleaning the air however. That's why I have Friedrich B as well. BTW speaking of which it costs 500$ and is a set of metal plates with a fan made in the U.S",0

5071,"Duck with cherries, rabbit with kasha anyone?. In addition to all the beautiful words said about Le Creuset I want to add several things that I haven't seen anywhere else.        First, the oval shape in a pot this size is preferable because it's easier to lift (you hold the pot closer to your body). Also it fits better in the oven. A 5 pound duck fits perfectly in 9 1/2 quarter oval pot with just enough room left to place some cherries or oranges around.         Second, Le Creuset became some sort of a cult (I saw a couple of large french ovens on Emeril's show the other day.) and if you are into French, Cajun or just any rich cooking you just have to have at least one.         Third, the price seems to be high, but then I saw some fifty year old Le Creuset ovens being sold at the auction for at list 25% of what they would cost new now. Think of it as an investment.         Forth, about the colors. I was disappointed in the beginning to find out that they only sell this size in white or French blue. But when I received my blue oval oven I loved the color. The picture in the catalog doesn't do it justice. This large pot in red (my initial choice) would have looked like a fire truck. I since added a couple more blue pieces and for those who are interested in starting their tableware collection, this color coordinates beautifully with the Denby Reflex pattern",0

Also, the on/off switch is not always very responsive",0
5083,EASY DOES IT. The Loren set was assembled (except for the table) and securely packed. Good workmanship. I recommend the set,0
5084,"Absolutely great. I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled",0
5085,"Versatile and good additional piece. The 3 quart saucepan is a great piece.  The lid has perforated holes to allow either steam to excape, or when cooking pasta, the elimination of using a colander.  The lip is a nice touch and much appreciated in a larger saucepan, whose use extends beyond reduction sauces, gravies, and hot beverages.  Good to boil potatos and pasta. Probably deep enough to use as a double boiler for a small amount of melting, but have not tried yet. Coated to withstand metal utensils, but it is safer to use silicone.  Easy clean up, but you must buy a hard anodized cookware cleaner or expect stains.  Nice versatile sized item",0
5086,GREAT COLOR. This food coloring was the best I have ever used.  It is very concentrated. I obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time.  I did not notice a flavor at all so I look forward to trying the black.  The bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish,0
5087,"Better than advertised!. I love my cat but detested the cat box.  After reading the reviews I bought this and it is the best buy of the year!  No smell, my cat took to it right a way, After I ordered, I bought a box of the crystal litter and put it on top of her litter.  By the time this box came in she was ready!  No smell, and it last over the suggested 30 days.  Almost makes me want to get another cat",0
5088,"My Kids Love the Mickey Wafflemaker!. We went on a Disney cruise recently and my children had Mickey waffles almost every day for breakfast.  I checked online to see if they had the same wafflemaker, but this one was just as good.  My children love having Mickey Mouse waffles.  I make them at least once a week.  It's easy to use, easy to clean and the waffles are ready in about 90-120 seconds.  They also give you some recipes for specialty waffles.  I would recommend this wafflemaker to anyone who enjoys Mickey!",0
5089,"Excellent product. I have been using Airbake pizza pans for at least ten years, if not longer.  My original ones are still in great condition.  I spray the pan with no-stick spray before putting the pizza on the pan.  The fact that cheese can get stuck in the holes is indeed a drawback, but the fact that you get a nicely browned crispy crust more than outweighs the inconvenience.  I make my own pizza dough, and bake the pizza at 425.  (Maybe it doesn't brown as nicely at a lower temperature?)I scrub the pan with a plastic mesh scrubber and dish detergent, and let the suds sit on the pan for a while if something is sticking to it.  A round wooden toothpick neatly removes any cheese caught in the holes.I agree that a Teflon coated pan would be quickly marred by the pizza wheel, since my metal pans are scored from years of use.  The marks from the pizza wheel do not impact the performance of the metal pan, but I would think that they would cause food to stick to the teflon pan",0
5090,"Eliminate mess and odor!. Wow I am very impressed with this product! I have 3 indoor-only cats. When I first saw this product in the pet store I thought this thing would fill up too quickly, but I have owned it for a month now and only needed to empty it once. I also assumed I'd have to replace the bag roll each time it was emptied, but that was not the case - the original bag roll still has plenty left!I used to flush the litter waste but there were always kitty litter grits sticking to the toilet bowl or seat and falling on the floor. Also our toilet backed up once when I tried to put too many litter clumps in it - eww! But the alternative - smelly trash - was just not an attractive option. So I decided to give the Litter Locker Plus a try and very glad I did!I wonder if the previous reviewer who complained about it filling up fast had an earrlier smaller version, because my 3 cats produce a normal amount of waste which I scoop 2-3 times a day and it didn't fill up until 2 weeks passed",0
5091,Excellent Towels for the Price. These towels are an excellent bargain. They are just the right size for wrapping my hair in and still big enough to dry off with.,0
5092,"Very pleased with purchase. Mikasa's dishes blend well with my Paltzgraf ""Gazebo"" collection, extending my adventure in white dishes into the second 20 years of our marriage. These are great for blending with other tableware and lend themselves to formal or casual dinners. We've used them in the warming oven and microwave...kids LOVE the size of the bowls for cereal and icecream but we've had to school them on portion size in 13 oz. bowls.I ordered three sets and had to ask Amazon to send another to replace dishes broken in transit. Each of the three sets had broken dinner or salad plates. We were able to replace all with the fourth shipment. The exchange was very easy",0
5093,"may deserve 5 stars... solid, well made, cool looking and I think works well.  wife doesn't like it because only a small amount of pepper per pump, which is true but I don't think someone would expect large amounts ""per pump"" from this... certainly good enough for peppering a meal versus cooking.  I'm going to buy the salt mill to go with it.  four stars because of my wife's opinion and it is a bit pricey...otherwise I'd give it five",0
5094,"Awesume confetti color!. My daugter moved into her 5 bedroom home recently, and loves her small powder room downstairs right off the living room. She decided to go ""Bold"" with black and white stripes wallpaper and a bright pink flowers border at the top. I searched and searched for the right color of ""bright pink""...finally found these confetti pink towels. I was not disappointed when they arrived, more important ...neither was she!!!Awesume color and great quality. Thanks for such a product",0
5095,Great for &quot;ON THE GO&quot;. I just received my Zojirushi Duel Coffeemaker and it lives up to my expectation.  It distributes coffee evenly into both cups and the cups are great for home or travel. I was very surprised at the great cup of coffee this machine makes. I would purchase again.  GREAT LITTLE COFFEE MAKER!!,0
5096,Sheet review. I bought this as a gift.  I was told that the 800 count label was applied on the package over a 250 count label.  The sheets feel like a higher grade than 250 but it makes one wonder.  We also recieved king size rather than queen.  We may have considered exchanging them but the recipient is out of country.,0
5097,"Good but not Wonderful. I hate giving a less than perfect review, but I have found this product to be a bit disappointing.  Maybe it is me that is not doing something right, but even after spraying it with Pam, I can't seem to get the cakes I make in it out without them falling apart in some way.  Cleaning it is also more difficult than your more traditional baking pans.However, my daughter loves it, and we will continue to use it until we figure out what works",0
5098,"GREATEST THING  SINCE TUNAFISH. MY SON IS A CHEF AND RECOMMENDED THIS ITEM. BEING AN OBEDIENT MOTHER, I PURCHASED IT.  IT WAS FABULOUS. IT CUTS AS FAST AS HE DOES, AND JUST AS EVENLY SLICED.

5101,"Wonderful and Waterproof. This is a wonderful mitt! By being waterproof, it maintains insulation even when I accidentally stick my thumb into some of my hot cooking.I purchased mitts for others in my family",0
5102,"great hand-held sharpner. For a relatively inexpensive sharpner this does a super job, and the scissor sharpner is a welcome extra",0
5103,A big funnel and worth the cost. This funnel is bigger than I expected and for the cost it should have been. It is very nicely made with a very wide mouth and hefty material. It will hold a lot of liquid if you pour too fast but is very well balanced and has not yet tipped on me like other funnels do this is probably due to it's significant weight.,0
5104,"Purchased as a Xmas gift. Extremely satisfied with this purchase.  Even though it was purchased as a late Xmas gift (was ordered on 12/21) and was told it would arrive on or after the 3rd week in January, it arrived on 12/27.  Not a bad deal when your order ships for free. Would recommend this product and site to all my friends and co-workers",0
5105,"Functional opener and helps to avoid splitting a cork. I found the Pedrini double lever opener to be a good buy. There are many others which look similar, but look closer. The Pedrini has a true wound-metal screw while many others only give you a die-cast screw. The difference is important as the die-cast style has a thick solid center to the screw, so it must displace more cork while turning thus increasing the effort and the risk of cork splitting. The diecast screw is also not nearly as strong as the wound-metal and can crack and break; it is also heavier. It is a good value, a good manufacturer and a good choice",0
5106,"Great piece, I love it. I wanted a small table to put in my guest room to put the tv on.  When I saw this piece on the website I thought that it would go good with the cherry bed that I had in there.  My son uses the guest room as his game room for his PS2 and Gamecube, etc.  We put all of the game stuff in the doors so that when guests are in there they cannot see all of his game stuff and it does not look cluttered. &#60;br /&#62;When my husband got the piece put together (which he had no problems like some of the other reviewers stated) I was so impressed by how great it looked in the room with the bed.  It matches perfect!  I am really pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone that does not have a lot of space for big pieces.  The only thing I did not like was that it had a couple of little tiny knicks in the wood but my husband touched that up with some stain that we had that was the same color.  Overall, very pleased and would buy night stands if they had them",0

5110,"Great Machine, Great Price. I read mixed reviews on the XP4050 on the web, with some folks tagging it as unreliable or noisy, or in several cases DOA. I decided to take a chance because my past experience with a Krups espresso machine was excellent.I've had the XP4050 for over a month now and it has performed flawlessly since day one.  The coffee is terrific, the frothing attachment works well (I removed the attachment from my last machine and used the metal wand only), and it works beautifully with my favorite brand of ground coffee--far better than my old machine.I would have given the XP4050 five stars, except for the wait between pushing a button and achieving results.  For instance, if you brew your espresso and press the steam button you have to wait some time before the machine is ready to roll.  I suspect this is no different than what might be expected from any machine in this class, but it is irritating in the wee hours when I am impatiently awaiting my first jolt of the day.So far, the XP4050 is a great machine and I am a satisfied customer",0
5111,"Flip it is awesome!. As a military spouse, we move, and have different types of floors that need cleaning.  I have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home, and also in our previous home abroad.  The Vaccum side does not work well at all, but I prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how I mop.  In comparison to sponge and rag mops, this leaves the floor pretty dry, and the suction is great.  As long as you empty the tank and keep it clean, and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank, it works wonderfully.  It's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers, that generally just push dirt around.  I believe it's worth the $$.  I've had mine for two years now",0
5112,Contour Pillows. An excellent value! I have been looking out for this type of pillow and was so pleased to see the Amazon ad.Quite comfortable -- I have neck problems with arthritis and pinched nerves and this pillow definitely provides relief,0
5113,"at long last!. i dont have a lot of extra money so i couldnt justify buying this while i had a handmixer that worked.needless to say, last saturday, my hand mixer finally beat the dust... meanwhile i did a little happy dance......and bought this.i do a lot of cookies. that's my specialty.the only gripe i had is maybe the bowl could be bigger so i could do my triple batches, but whatever. i cant afford a more expensive one just so it would have a bigger bowl.i got to use it for the first time tonight on my oatmeal raisin. yeah a little noise, but not unexpected or scary. there was a little movement too, but again not unexpected considering how thick the mixture is.i had to lift it every once in awhile to make sure that all the mixture was getting beat in but didnt really need to- everything got mixed very thoroughly; much easier than having to stand there with the hand mixer and fight with it.i havent messed with the dough hook simply because i use a breadmaker for that, and i havent used the whip because i really never have needed that either.i am looking forward to getting some of the attachments, especially the ice cream one and the meat grinder. we try to eat as ""natural"" as possible, and i am looking forward to doing ground chicken and other things.i know its not an investment to enter into lightly, but its well worth the money because i know this will last me into my middle age.i love the heft of this machine also. i am one that buys the most durable things i can; i have a sewing machine that was made in switzerland, and i can tell this is the same type of construction- all metal.",0
5114,"powerful little electric broom. i own an oreck vacuum for the rugs in the kids room, but 75% of my house (approx 1500 sq. feet) is sealed hardwood oak floors. i have two dogs, a rottweiler and a jack russell terrier, who shed quite a lot year round. the oreck is very good for the carpeted areas, but the beater bar feature just sort of blows the dirt and hair around the wood floors and is clumsy in the corners. after reading the reviews i decided to try the euro-pro shark. the price was great with free shipping.  it's very small and lighthweight which is a plus, and stores easily in my broom closet. it has a lot of suction power on the wood floors, and picks up all the dog hair easily, even in the corners and under the radiater registers. i've tried other electric brooms, but they didn't have anywhere near the suction of the shark and are made much more cheaply, the last one i had actually snapped in half. if you're looking for a heavy duty vacuum for carpets, this is not the one, but if you want a powerful little electric broom for hard floor surfaces i would highly reccomend this one",0
5115,"Better than other sticker/adhesive removers. Un-Du is a much better product than the other similar type adhesive removers (Goo-Gone, Goof Off, etc.) because it is safe for plastic.  Those other products will dull or dissolve plastic, such as the plastic used to make CD jewel cases.  Un-du does the job without causing damage.  I suspect that like me, the surface that often needs adhesive removed is plastic, so this is the only product to have",0

While you'll want to pull out your special, grape-specific glasses for those special bottles, this glass is excellent for getting the most out of everyday wines with a minimum of fuss.  They fit in the top rack of most dishwashers and are very durable.  (I've used them for the past 5 years.)

5126,"Still Going Strong!. I got a Good Chef pizza stone as a wedding gift about 3 and a half years ago.  I was still a novice pizza chef, so it took me a while to get accustomed to the art of pizza crust.  The better my crust and technique got, the more I appreciated my pizza stone.Crust is crispy and the texture is fantastic, even with heavy, moist toppings (one of my favorites is a variety of cooked wild mushrooms, thyme, a little fontina, and some prosciutto).  I am committed to healthy cooking, so not having to use oil to prevent sticking is a plus.  I just scatter a bit of coarse-ground cornmeal onto the preheated stone and it comes up easily.Of course pre-heating the stone (at a high temperature) is the only way to acheive desired results.  And the more the stone is used the more non-stick it becomes.  We treat it the way we'd treat cast-iron.Having a pizza stone is a great way to get brick-oven-style crust at home (and homemade is almost always healthier)",0
5127,"Good Product. I like the depth of this container.  I use it more for storage than as a marinator because of its depth.  This is excellent for keeping berries fresh.  I have no use for the grater; I prefer the food processor and standing graters.  The canister is a clear plastic, which looks much better than the smoke-colored ones.As a marinator, it produced very flavorful chicken, but I'm not sure if it was more flavorful than traditionally marinated.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the canister is top-rack dishwasher safe, but the lids are not",0
5128,"Knives are great, block should be redesigned. This set was a replacement for a $30 set I owned. The knives are a huge improvement, sharp, no flexing when cutting through hard items, and the set includes all the knives an amateur cook will use.However, the wood block is a different story. The holes go completely through the wood block and the steak knives are too long so that the tips (of the bottom row) extend past the block. This means they scratch the owner's counter and possibly dull the knife tips. As a solution I store half the steak knives in a drawer, not ideal, but I never heard a response from an email sent to Henckels website.If the block was redesigned it would be a five star product",0
5129,Krups FBC512 in white. This toaster oven works well.  It has various presets for pizza and bagelsthat makes it very easy to use. For bagels it toasts the top and warmsthe bottom so they really come out nice.It cooks pizza a lot faster than the oven with no preheat time.Toast always seems to come out just right.  The toast setting defaultsto level 4 but needs a setting of 6-7 which is easy to change.When the time is up a fairly loud beeper sounds and the oven shuts off.This is really great esp. for kids since they tend to getdistracted and leave stuff in the oven for too long.I think the white color is much more attractive than the black and it alsomatches all the appliances in our kitchen,0

I have a 10 inch skillet, 4.5 quart sauce and 5 quart oval pans and they are best pans I've ever owned.What I love about them?1.  Mine do not have any sticking issues what so ever.2.  They clean extremely easy and fast via hand washing (no hard scrubbing at all).3.  Since it only takes seconds to clean, I can reuse to cook something else without any flavor from the previous meal.4.  The handles do not get hot and they have a good non-slip grip (I have the silicone rubber handles).5.  They apparently can be put in the oven up to 350 degrees but I have not tried that yet.6.  They are not as heavy as some professional ones.I would recommend buying this brand.ConIf I had to say anything bad about them, the only thing I can think of is the rivets that are inside the pan that attach the handle to the pan can get food stuck around them so you really have to clean around that area good.

5144,"Happy pet owner. The Mattress Tool is the most used tool from my Dyson DC14 Animal Upright Vacuum collection.  I inherited a cat who assumes my queen size bed is hers.  I use this tool on the mattress, mattress pad, feather bed, sheets (while still on the bed), pillow cases (left on the pillows),pillows and my beloved quilts and shams (easiest to clean while left on bed).  It really saves time and my washer and dryer.  I used to double and triple wash to get rid of the cat hair and have to clean hair out of the washer each time.  I even use it on clothing (I put them on a hanger and hold the bottom down while gliding the tool downward).  I also have a 12 yr. old German Shepherd who sheds a lot.  I use the Mini Turbine Head to clean her super-sized bed and twin-sized sheets (easiest while still on bed).  I also have the Low Reach Floor Tool.  Fantastic for getting pet hair from under my heavy furniture.  I've owned a lot of vacuums and Dyson is by far the best out there for pet owners.  I use all of the tools and they are great.  I hardly ever used the tools on my other uprights because they didn't seem to get enough suction to do the job right.  After 12 years of struggling to keep up with all of the pet hair now I can get the job done in no time and the results are a truly clean house.  I've actually reversed the damage to my carpets from embedded pet hair.  Dyson is powerful enough to pull out the pet hair.  Another good point,  Dyson is the cleanest vacuum to use.  No spilled dirt while emptying the dirt bin (like my other two bagless vacuums) and no nasty filters to wash every time you vacuum.  How good can it possibly get?!",0

They feel thin, which is actually very comfortable, but I don't know if this is the 'microfiber' part or if they are just cheaper sheets.  A good buy for a cheap, nice extra set",0
5151,Excellent product. Works well.  You can adjust the mill to grind pepper to your desired level of granularit,0
5152,"Impressive. These little cutting boards are excellent.  Ordered 2 more after finding the first one so useful.  We love the fact that they solve the dripping issue and make excellent casual serving trays.  Not bulky, easy cleaning and storage, what more can you ask for",0
5153,"Solid and sturdy, it does what you want a toaster oven to do. Broil, toast and bake. Those are the three things I look for my toaster to do.  It does all of them just fine.  I like the bottom crumb pan which helps to keep those nasty burnt crumobs from ruining your toaster",0
5154,"Great vacuum for the price. This vacuum was very reasonably-priced and the suction is phenomenal!  It puts my old vacuum to shame.  Every carpet in my house feels flufflier after vacuuming with this vacuum.  At first I thought it was my imagination but the next day I felt it too. Now on to the problems:  One of the side wheels came off the first time I used it.  Also, the wheels underneath left grey skid marks on my floors.  And lastly, you HAVE to buy the 20' hose attachment.  I didn't and regretted it the first time I was using this vacuum.  It's really a necessity and should come with the vacuum.  I have since ordered it and am awaiting its arrival.",0
5155,"Good Replacement Parts. I have had the Krups Crystal Arome #398 for almost 8 years now and the original carafe just broke.  This replacement fits the coffee maker just fine, but the ""white"" color is a little off from the original one.  They did make some improvements to the lid design, which is more sturdy than the original.  Overall, I am very pleased with this item",0
5156,"Crafter's Creative Helper. This neat little organizer, plus its coordinating friends, has turned my collection of beading supplies, scrapbooking supplies, paints, glues and assorted ""treasures"" from scary to streamlined, and almost doubled the amount of ""stuff"" I can fit in the closet allocated for my projects.  The items are easy to build, units can be attached with dowels, and are made to accommodate oversized craft supplies",0
5157,"Worth Every Penny!. You won't believe how much difference a shower filter can make, & this one is wonderful! My brush & comb just glide through my long hair now, instead of dealing with tangles & hair braking off. My skin is so soft, even without a moisturizer. My soap & shampoo lather much better & I'm able to smell the scents so much better. I'd highly recommend this product",0
5158,So comfy!!. These sheets are so pretty and really comfy/silky.  THey are tough to get wrinkles out though,0
5159,"The best. I have been cooking on cast iron cookware for about 35 years,it is what I was taught to cook on. My Great aunt and MOM used only cast iron. I have about 30 different pieces most were handed down from them. It is the longest lasting of any cook ware made. Once it is seasoned I never wash with soap just plain steel wool and hot water,the into the oven set on 250degrees to dry and season more! IT IS THE BEST",0
5160,Great mixing bowls!. Love the bright colors on these bowls.  They are super functional too and the sizes seems to work well for various mixing jobs.,0
5161,"Obsession. Harley has always shown a polite interest in toys. He will dutifully chase the tennis ball for a few minutes before settling down for a nap, one eye half open to monitor my activities. In the Pre-Bad-Cuz Era, Harley's main interest in life was me. Following me around the house, sitting on his bed and simply watching me with those big brown eyes, yipping uncontrollably whenever I left him in the car. That was all before the Bad Cuz. Once I introduced this toy to my 85-pound dane/pit/boxer mix, he transmogrified into a ruthless squeaky toy killer. There is no other way to describe him but obsessed. My dog cares of nothing else but a red rubber squeaky toy with martian legs and two tiny pointed nipples. He can't bear to look at it in my hand or in another dog's mouth. He goes crazy barking and whining whenever he believes I have waited too long to throw it. The Bad Cuz has become an addiction. I fear what he might do to get more Bad Cuzes. Or, what if I was throwing the Bad Cuz and then I tripped and sprained my ankle? Would Harley continue to chase and play with the toy, or would he run over to me in concern and lick my face? I fear the former. And yet I continue to give him what he wants, because I have never seen my dog so frenetically wildly happy. I am willing to give up being the center of Harley's world because it gives me so much pleasure to see him so pleased with himself when he has wrestled the toy to the ground and commenced to squeak it to death. This is the first Bad Cuz I have bought Harley, but I guarantee you it will not be the last.",0
5162,"Works pretty well, but wrong size adapters!. I was really annoyed for a day or two when I got this, because it definitely did not fit on any faucet in the house, and none of the included adapters worked either. I have a pretty standard kitchen sink, so it shouldn't be this hard. I did find the correct adapter at a local hardware store for $3, and since then the filter has worked well.We have a weird problem with some compound that smells like gasoline in the tap water in the SF Bay Area. This removed most of the smell and taste. So in that respect, I'm pretty happy",0
5163,"Very pleased. I'm very pleased with this cutting board - it is functional and washes well.  I leave it sitting on my counter at all times because it's also attractive.  The 'Granite' used in the product description is simply referring to the color and look of the board, not the material it's made from.  It clearly states in the description that it's constructed of plastic material.  A great board for a great price",0
5164,"Gorgeous!. This is a very handsome set on my countertop. The tools are very well-made and have exceptionally comfortable and sturdy handles. My favorites are the omelet turner and the ball whisk, which makes whipping up gravy on the stove a breeze. The little hooks on the exterior of the basket canister are very useful for a peeler, measuring spoons, etc.. Happy with this set. Kudos to WMF",0
5165,"very useful / should be included with vacuum. The low reach tool is very useful and easy to use, fast to attach and good on every surface. With this tool you can reach under the shallowest of furniture. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I think this tool should be included when you purchase the DC07 because of the DC07's inability to get under almost all furniture unless you put the tiny tool on it which is tedious",0
5166,It does not have a sound option. I bought one of these based on the Amazon product description that says it has a sound option.  When I received it I found it does not and only has spray capabilities.  Saying that it seems to work well and so far is deterring our cat from spraying the piece of furniture the kit is protecting,0
5167,"Great Cooking Gear. My wife and I first purchased Calphalon Contemporary Nostick cooking gear about a year ago.  We both love them.  Not only do they cook evenly and quickly, but they are easy to handle & store.  Additionally, clean up is easier then anything we have previously owned.We purchased some additinal items through Amazon, and received them in less than 5 working days.  We are thoroughly impressed with both Calphalon and Amazon",0
5168,"GranPappy. It was a Christmas gift, truly enjoyed by my grandson who loves to cook (with supervision).  It's easy to store, and able to keep the oil in its container for several uses.  Bigger than the GranDaddy so you can cook more at one time.  It's great.  Have one myself and it has been with us for years.",0
5169,"Love It!!. I use mine in the closet where we have two litter boxes for our cats.  You don't realize it's working because you can't smell anything but I can tell a difference in the smell when the SmellKiller runs out of water.  Our condo is only 780 square feet, so you would certainly know it if there was a big mess in the litter boxes.  I have to go and check in the closet to see if it needs to be cleaned out.  I like the Universal one because it seems to me that it would be harder to keep up with the water levels in the regular ones.  Since the metal piece has to be in both water and air, it seems easier to get the Universal so you don't have to monitor the water level in the cup",0
5170,"beautiful, but small. This is another gorgeous piece by fiesta.  It is lovely and functional.  My only issue is that the dimensions state it is 12"" tall, when it is really less than 8""!!!  So, beautiful, but small.",0
5171,"good size. I have 2 of these mugs in plum.  They are the perfect size for cereal, soup and hot chocolat",0
5172,"I like it so far!. I just used it for the first time today and I made a very nice pizza that was very crispy on the bottom unlike with my old metal pizza pan.  It does take a bit more prep than just using a metal pan though (read instruction manual) but I knew it would be, so it doesn't bother me.  I haven't tried cleaning it yet but I don't imagine it being too difficult. make sure you get a pizza peel to go with it! It makes things alot easier!",0
5173,"Great Product, Great Price. I have several brands of silicone baking mats and these are just as good as the ones costing twice as much... highly recommended",0
5174,"Make the pot removeable!. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that you can NOT take out the pot.You also cannot immerse this in water, so cleaning is a giant pain.That said, it's GREAT for dips that need to be kept warm, such as my famous 'chile con queso'. Just put everything together and plug it in.A few hours before a party, cut a 4"" block of Velveeta into 1"" cubes, put in the Lil' Dipper. Add a few tablespoons of medium Pace Picante. Add 1/3 of a small can of chopped green chiles.For more spice, dribble in the juice from a jar of jalapenos.To thin it out, you can add cream, half and half, or milk. Or even water (but that will dull the taste).Serve with your favorite torilla chips.You can also make this in the microwave if you need to make something 'in a hurry'.I wouldn't recommend putting this on a dining table, as you'd need an extension cord, and kids could trip over it and burn themselves (heck, I guess at some parties, adults could, too!) but a buffet or counter against the wall would be fine.",0
5175,"Great supplemental light. Okay, I haven't used this while reading in bed yet...but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting, it's great!The light isn't good for areas that are adequately well-lit, so don't bother to use the light there. But in areas where light is dim, the light shines. Literally. It casts a bright light on the page(s) that you need to view. It's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading.Yes, it's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag. Imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go.  The power adapter, however, is a cumbersome brick. As for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for, I can't offer an estimate of time yet - but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so- cumulative, not consecutive hours. So, no complaints yet about that.Whenever I saw this light online or in the store, I used to think, ""Why in the world would I ever want something like this?"" Now, my thoughts are: ""Why didn't I ever think to buy this before?",0
5176,"Very practical!. These may not be a cute as the tabletop salt and pepper shakers (the smaller round ones) but let me tell you that having the handles makes a world of difference when it comes to cooking.  You know the moment that I am talking about....your hands are covered in whatever you are making (flour, butter,chicken juice, ect.) or they are already pre-occupied by the spoon, oven-mitt, pot, or pan you might be tending to but you still need a little more salt.  What do you do?  You grab the handle...thats what it's there for, and you need not worry about it slipping out of your hands and onto the floor or into your food",0
5177,Very nice gift. I ordered this wine tote as a gift and was pleased how fast it was shipped. I live in Alaska and had ordered the bag last Thursday...it was here on Monday.The bag it's self is awesome. This is the perfect gift.,0
5178,"I LOVE THIS GRILL!. I wanted to replace my George Foreman grill and happened upon the Hamilton Beach Indoor Grill at this site.  After reading the ratings from other consumers, which I think is a fantastic idea for Target.com, I was ecstatic!  All of the things I disliked about the GF grills were mentioned by others, especially the task of cleaning them.  Cleaning my HB grill is far less difficult because everything except the electric probe is immersible.  I was a bit concerned about grease splattering because the HB grill isn't covered but that turned out to be a non-issue.  Not to mention, it costs less than 1/2 the price of the comparable GF grill!  Thank you Hamilton Beach for making such an outstanding product and thank you Target.com!",0
5179,Fine for inexpensive can opener. I like the color. It's a little bigger than I thought and the arm pops off alot but as far as opening a can it does great. The magnet holds the lid after opened. Great for an inexpensive can opener,0
5180,"Great for the office!. This is a wonderful, inexpensive little space heater that functions perfectly for my needs (over-airconditioned office).  It's unfortunate that this item has received so many poor reviews--but I feel that's mainly the result of operator error.  The timer function seems to be stumping quite a few people.  If you purchase this heater and have trouble after reading the enclosed instructions, simply read the review, ""Things you should know before buying"" from November 4, 2006-- everything is explained very clearly",0
5181,"one of My boys bought this and.... This is a GREAT shower curtain, it resists stains and it pretty well made, specially for the price",0
5182,"Delonghi portable radiator heater. Arrived in great condition.  As indicated in the directions, there was a slight burning smell the first time I used it.  I haven't had that smell since.  Easy to use programmable timer and temperature settings.  A great way to heat up a room instead of the whole house",0
5183,"The Little Magic Wand. Rarely would I give an ordinary vacuum attachment a five star rating, but this is far from ordinary.I was impressed first off with the packaging. Usually when I buy something that's encased in plastic it takes Superman to cut the thing out. Not so with the thoughtful folks at Dyson; they provided a package that you can easily open and then close again.Second, I was impressed by the construction of the brush itself. The bristles are very fine yet sturdy and practically mold themselves around anything you vacuum with it. And the material used to make the rest of the brush is the same tough crash helmet plastic as the Dyson itself. Nice.Something to keep in mind is that the brush comes with two small adapters; one has a small triangle on it and the other has a small ""O"". In the package there is a small booklet with pictures showing what the adapters are for; the one with the triangle attaches to the brush when you want to put it on the long wand, the adapter with the ""O"" attaches to the brush when you want to use it with just the hose. I mention this because I ended up vacuuming all my blinds (and even my curtains) before I realized I needed one of these adapters. Nevertheless, even without the adapter the brush picked up a lot of dust, which says a lot for the suction power of the Dyson.I have never been this amazed by something as simple as a vacuum attachment before. This brush is like a little magic wand. Never before have I been able to vacuum my TVs, computers, blinds, curtains, and just about anything with this much ease. The brush not only increased my respect and admiration for the Dyson itself but also for the ingenious minds behind the development of it.I highly recommend this product to anyone who owns a Dyson vacuum",0
5184,just what the doctor orderd. this is a great product!!! it works great!! it makes a cake look great with holiday theme....product is built to last two life times  and then some....a little green food coloring makes it look like a forest/powered sugar and you have a masterpiece....happy holidays to all!!!!!!,0
5185,"Attractive and functional. This is a clever design that really works. It heats up quickly and you can simply lift the kettle and use it anywhere without dragging the cord around. The on/off knob seems a bit fragile but I've been using this thing 2-3 times per day for a couple of months and I'm quite happy with it. I recently noticed some salty crystals in the bottom of my coffee cup. I found that the mineral deposits that usually crud up heating elements simply sit on the bottom of this kettle. They don't stick to the metal, they just pile up. No boiling vinegar required, just wipe it out occasionally and it is pristine",0
5186,"Dogs LOVE the sound and get so excited. . . could be more durable though. . . My dogs just go crazy over the sound this toy makes! Excellent exercise for them. I really, really wish it were a bit more durable as my dogs are able to destroy/chew them -- I have to take them away long before the sound mechanism gives out due to them makes holes in the 'skin'. Please Wiggly Giggly. . . can you make them stronger somehow? Then they would be perfect! :-",0
5187,Best little fan ever. I love this little fan.  It's perfect for cooling one person.  I have it on my nite table and use it every night.  Amazingly quiet and soothing air.,0
5188,"Forget the foot switch -- it has a timer!!!. I got this for my old SF apartment where I have no heat in the bathroom and the room gets terribly cold on winter mornings.  This unit has a 24 hour timer, so you can set it to turn on at regular times every day.  So the heater turns on 10 minutes before my alarm goes off, and I don't scream when my feet hit the bathroom tile anymore!  I LOVE it!  If you use the timer funtion, you never have to use the foot pedal switch (which is a bit stubborn).  The heat plus fan is also a real plus, you don't end up with one really hot area in the room and the rest of it freezing cold.  The best possible unit particularly for bathroom and kitchen use (safe in both rooms)",0
5189,"Simpe, useful, cheap. What could be better?. Since there's no picture, here's a little useful information:Unlike most of the kitchen thermometers, this one is laid out with the display on the side rather than the top, more like a fever thermometer. For making tea this is a little inconvenient, but it'll be nice for grill use since I usually stick the thermometer into burgers from the side.Also, the cap which covers the probe conveniently snaps (securely) onto the other end of the case to extend the thermometer a few inches so you don't burn your fingers. Nice touch!Otherwise, it is as advertised and works quite well. I'm ordering another, in fact",0
5190,"Good Gadget. For very little money, you get an easy to use and sturdy corkscrew",0
5191,"Great bed for little animals.. My family has two dogs, and I bought it for the older one, but the puppy liked it so much.    Now the older one just sleeps on the couch instead of her bed.

5192,"The BEST Cervical roll-- for me, at least. As a physical therapist who suffers from neck pain, this is the ONLY pillow that I can use without waking up to having cervical muscle spasms in the mornings. This pillow is great for people who do not have the normal curvature of the cervical spine a.k.a.-- straight necks (cervical arthritis etc).I bought one 3 years ago at CVS & have been looking for a year now for a replacement since mine cannot support my neck very well anymore.  It has been a week that I have been waking up to neck spasms & I am delighted to find that it is here at Amazon.  It was here all along, I just have been typing in the wrong name-- cervical pillow, cervical roll, neck roll etc....  I am happy that I remembered what my 5 year old son called it-- BONE, typed it, and boy was he right.",0
5193,"Two years and running. This gadget works well if you do not overfill it.  The MISTO website says to put no more than 1/3 cup of oil in it.  We made the mistake of putting too much oil in at first and it would only ""stream"" oil for a month or so.  We thought it was a terrible device until the oil got down to the level where it should be.  I'm guessing most of the unhappy reviews here are because of this problem.  Now that we know this is the issue, it sprays wonderfully!  We're going to get another one for canola",0
5194,"Great Product - but be aware where you buy. I find myself somewhat in a dilemma as I am writing this review. To avoid any confusion, let me start out by saying that this grater is quite good. As with all graters, there are problems with certain products - generally those that are very soft. A fresh Gouda might clog up the grater whereas a medium-ripe Gouda will be grated without any problems. Personally, I use this grater only on Parmesan and for this purpose it simply cannot be beat.Installed on a wall, the grater sits snugly in a cradle while it is being charged - making at always ready when you need it. If you, like I, use large amounts of certain cheeses (or perhaps chocolates) in your cooking, this grater will make your life tremendously easier.One thing to consider, though, is that the rechargable batteries - just like all such batteries - have a limited life. My first grater stopped working after about four years but frankly, by then I had certainly gotten my money's worth.I also want to point something out to the prospective Amazon shopper that I wish I had known: While this product is great (as I described), please be aware through which retailer Amazon sells this item. One of the retailers offering this product here is Stacks and Stacks. If you go to the effort of looking at the company's website, you will quickly learn that their products center around shelves, small containers, etc. but NOT around kitchen items. That said, the grater seems to be constantly listed as ""In Stock"" when it is, in reality, not. Stacks and Stacks will have to order the product from the manufacturer and it will take much longer than the stated delivery estimate. It actually took so long when I ordered the item that I had to file a claim through Amazon to get a refund - the company itself refused to respond to any email. While I cannot attest to the company's reliability with other items, I advise you to forgo ordering it from them",0
5195,"Simply the Best. I have used this Taylor thermometer for years and it is reliable, accurate and easy to use.  You can use it in the oven while the meat, casserole, etc. is baking.  Other thermometers have a glass insertion rod and can break.  The stainless steel Taylor goes in without having to make a hole first with another utensil.  For Christmas I gave these thermometers to all my children and my parents who could not find them.  My husband cannot grill without this thermometer",0
5196,"Loving them. Purchased these BRIGHT pink sheets for my 22 year old daughter.  The fun bold color and the HIGH quality are beyond my expectations. She has only two sets of sheets so they are in and out of the laundry quite a bit. They fit, wash and wear well,  saying I am pleased is an understatement",0
5197,"My poochies ought to be bald, WE LOVE THE FURMINATOR!. I have a Jack Russell Terrier and a Rat Terrier. Both have that short wiry hair that sticks to EVERYTHING, and they make little hair cobwebs throughout our home as well. Brushing wasn't working, frequent washing wasn't working. It was too expensive to buy this furminator treatment and have both dogs groomed too. I was at my wit's end.I purchased the small blue Furminator tool with 1.7 inch blade along with the Furminator Shampoo and Furminator Solution. I washed both dogs with the shampoo for 5 minutes each as directed. The shampoo smells like Pina Coladas which made the Rat Terrier lick-this is bad as soap does upset dog tummies. But a TON of hair came off of both dogs after the shampoo, about a fist-full each. Next, I slathered them up with the solution, which smells like roses or some other floral scent and left that on for 5 minutes. Again, another fistfull of hair came out with the rinse! I allowed both dogs a couple of hours to dry all the way, then came back and used this tool. The Rat Terrier wouldn't go for it, he hates all brushes. But the Jack Russell Terrier loves being brushed and let me go over her whole body except the sensitive areas with the tool. And let me tell you, I got a wad of superfine undercoat fur the size of her head off of that dog. And the only hair she's leaving around the house is hair that was already all over the place prior to the Furminator treatment. I don't get hair flying off her when petting her anymore, and even the Rat Terrier that wouldn't let me use the tool on him is still not putting out a lot of shedding.I would highly recommend the Furminator products. They are expensive and somewhat time consuming to use, but they work as advertised.",0
5198,"Works Like a Charm. One of my biggest challenges in baking pies is to ensure that I don't burn the crust while baking the pie itself. This shield really did the trick.

5203,"Gorgeous Shape. A wonderful bowl to use as a table centerpiece. The pedestal bottom is subtle and still allows for stacking when storing. As far as serving, the bowl is about medium sized. Works well as a roll or biscuit holder, salad mix for side salads or side dishes. It is not quite big enough for main dishes for more than 2 people. It is a must have bowl for your Fiestaware collection.I read so many reviews from people who received broken dishes when ordering Fiestaware from Amazon. The shippers must've really changed their packing techniques because every piece of Fiestaware that I've received when ordering directly from Amazon has been packed with much care and a lot of cardboard bumpers. Not a broken dish (knock on wood)",0
5204,"Last Blender you'll ever need. Bulky, noisy and takes up lots of space - BUT it is the greatest drink mixer you'll ever buy.  My wife is the queen of frosty drinks.  With this blender the ingredients don't separate half-way through your drinking pleasure.  Our old mixer, also touted as a professional blender, caused the ingedients to separate in the glass after about 3 minutes.  Have not seen that happening after this blender get's through doing its job. Crushes ice without cringing and is esstially oblivious to anything thrown in, just blends everyting into a great pulp.  Highly recommended for the serious frosty drinker",0

They think they are still on the tree out in the wild!  Silly bananas...Green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer.  Once, I got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger!The Lipper Beechwood Collection Banana Hanger is compact and doesn't take up much counter space which is a definite plus.

5209,"The right tool for the job. I'm at a point in my life where I am developing a taste for quality, and can finally afford the kind of quality I desire.  I like to dabble in the kitchen, so I've been building my arsenal of kitchenware recently.  I've invested in some high-quality cookware and utensils, and started working on some appliances.  I've got an 11-cup Cuisinart food processor, but that tends to be overkill for a lot of smaller jobs - I hate all the cleanup involved with making a cup of guacamole dip, for instance.  I like to use peeled whole tomatoes to make tomato sauce for pasta dishes, but my wife doesn't care for chunks of tomato in the finished sauce.  No problem... I just dunk the stick blender right into the can of tomatoes and out comes a nice thick puree with all the rich flavor that pre-made sauces seem to lack.This stick blender came highly recommended by an acquaintance, and it doesn't disappoint.  With its high-power motor, variable speed settings and versatile accessories, this is a compact and high-impact kitchen tool.  Easy to clean, too.  I would urge caution if you've never used one of these before, especially when working with very watery liquids as they can end up getting blown right out of your container if you're not careful",0

5212,"I'm OK with Robots taking over the world if they also do my chores... I'm OK with Robots taking over the world if they don't mind doing my chores as well!  This robot is perhaps the best purchase I've made in years.  We have hardwood floors and pet hair tumbleweeds that we were not able to reach, but were able to see.  Not only do we have clean floors now, but I barely have to do anything.  Probably the only thing it doesn't do is empty itself (you also have to occasionally make sure that the junk on your floor doesn't clog the brushes--just like any other vaccumme).  You also still have to pick up the stuff on the floor if you expect it to vaccume underneath, but it just gives us an excuse to keep our stuff tidy.Coming home each day to a clean house has been AWESOME! I just can't wait until they get a robot that will clean the shower...",0
5213,"Well worth the money!. I'd been thinking about buying a blender for making smoothies, milkshakes etc. for ages but instead made do with the ordinary blenders made exclusively for the home.  In short, those blenders have been utterly disappointing because they don't crush ice, feel too 'plastic-ky' and never produce good drinks.So, after reading the glowing reviews for Waring blenders, I decided to take the plunge and buy one.  I bought the commercial bar blender with the stainless steel canister (I guess I was worried that the traditional glass one might crack, even if others insist that it won't).  It seems expensive, but once you buy this you'll be wondering why you ever settled for anything less!  It crushes ice like a dream and I can turn out superb drinks (no lumps!).  It's extremely easy to use and so easy to clean.  I make breakfast smoothies every day now",0

My complaints are minor, but annoying,  namely the off and on switch is so small that during the day you can't really tell if it's on or off unless you stand right at thei machine and cup your hands over the area.  Ulnfortunetelyl,l many new applieances also have a minesciule light.  The other thing is the pour while brewing feature.  The pot is so samll, for one, why would you want it? and, two, I use my own cup instead of the glass caraffe so that the coffee drips right into the cup, and with the pour and brew feature nothing fits under it except the original caraffe-- so I took off the extra button, made the drip hole smaller with a piece of aluminum foil, and now I'm set.",0

5219,"Not bad!!. As with everything, I went on a search of all mug warmers in the universe before buying this one.  I found a universal complaint of ALL mug warmer reviewers (of any brand) was ""doesn't get hot enough"" (especially the USB models).  I think the manufacturers walk a thin line between ""doesn't get hot enough"" and setting the house on fire.Initially, I tried putting a cold cup of coffee upon my new Mr. Coffee and was disappointed in the warmer's ability to heat up an already cold cup of coffee.  (tried both metal and ceramic mug)The good news is that if you put a fresh hot cup of coffee right from the coffee maker onto the ""burner"" that it does a pretty good job in keeping it hot from that point.  I review this as satisfactory performance and give extra credit for its slim and sleek design",0

5225,"GOOD VALUE. I purchased the I-Roast 2, after having decent luck with I-Roast 1.   Hearthware seems to have corrected some of the very minor flaws with version 1 and I am extremely happy with it. The major thing that has been corrected is the tendency of the sealed top to unseal itself, which was a mess.  I have not had this happen with version 2.With some green beans, you have to roast smaller batches (Ethopian comes to mind) or it will overheat and shut down. However, it will do almost any controlled roast you could ever want. Version 2 seems much improved in roasting the entire batch more evenly, something that was not necessarily the case with version 1.  Version 2 also seems to take more slough out of the roasting chamber.Do be forewarned that this unit is VERY noisy (as most home roasters are, with the exception of the FreshRoast), so your neighbors may hate you if you live in an apartment.This is a great unit for the home roaster",0

5231,"Excellent edge, some design flaws. I baught my 8"" global chef's knife about 5 years ago.  It has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market.  The molybdenum/vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its Henkles/Wustolf counterparts.  My only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style, nor my large hands.  I don't mind the steel handles, although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip.  My main problem is with the tapered bolster, which is almost a lack of bolster altogether.  Coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife, extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand.I highly recommend globals, but I might suggest the 8 1/4"" heavyweight model, which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the Bolster.For more info on knife handling and care you might check out the CIA's book titled ""The Professional Chef's Knife Kit"".And one last comment.  Although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe, please, PLEASE, don't put your knives in the dishwasher.",0

Not a problem if you're putting it in a basement, but maybe a bit much in a living/sleeping area",0

5235,"Mice are nice. These colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys. They are treated with catnip, but to be honest, I don't think my cat knows the difference. Unlike their Zanies Furry Mice counterparts, Zanies Rainbow Mice also rattle, since they have tiny pebbles inside them. A word of caution about this though: the pebbles are encased inside a semi-rigid plastic cartridge (which makes up the body of the mouse). The furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued. After my cat played with one of the mice, the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed. Since there are pebbles inside, unsupervised play might not be very safe. It's best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them. Other than that, these are great toys and the price/quantity/quality ratio is pretty good. Quantity is important here, because, due to their small size, most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture. Since you get 60 mice in this package, you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action. In the long run, it's a lot cheaper than buying them individually",0

5240,"Ideal for Pet Hair. The Miele vacuum cleaner is already a substantial investment, but I recommend the turbobrush for those models that don't come with one. It's an especially useful add-on for those with pets, because the regular-head does only a fair job of picking up our golden retriever's shedded hair.  I could just manage it by tipping the regular brush, but this is not nearly as effective as the Turbo.  The Turbo rotates extremely fast (sorry, but the company supplies no specs on how fast), and has longer, more effective brushes to scoop up pet hair and any other kind of debris. This model (205-3) fits Miele vaccums only, but Model STB 201 Vario's adapter enables Turbo to attach to non-Miele vaccums with suction tubes that are between 30 and 38 mm. One other note: There's no storage cover; in fact, this one was not even wrapped in plastic for protection during transit. However, there was no damage.The rugs look noticeably cleaner with the Turbo, as the brushes also tend to fluff them for more effective vacuuming of debris. The difference is most noticeable on medium to heavy shag rugs.  There's one adjustment, a ""slide"" that you push to one side when going over heavy pile. The Turbo head adds a little of its own noise, a steady, non-annoying WHIRRRR as it speeds around. It's light enough to lift onto furniture that needs cleaning.  The instructions (which come in 14 languages) show how to remove hair, thread, etc. stubbornly caught on the brushes--either by cutting them away at the opening, or by removing the cover and either cutting or pulling manually. The instructions also include the line, ""Do not use on people or animals,"" a certain ice-breaker at your next social function.Overall, I'd recommend this as an immediate purchase for those with pets that shed (or get a model that comes with the Turbo). Otherwise, you may wish to wait and see whether the Miele on its own does a satisfactory job",0

5242,"Very cute - but requires responsibly. I have this tank sitting on my desk at the office and have had a beautiful healthy beta living in it for over two months.  This is wonderfully adorable novelty item and it looks very cute in my cubicle.The important thing to remember is that this is a fish you are committing to take care of.  If you are willing to put in the effort, great!  If not, DO NOT BUY THIS!What I have been doing is this:1.  Get a beta - not a goldfish.  Goldfish need more room than this tank can supply and also would prefer a filter.2.  Change the water often.  I do a small water change 2 or 3 times a week.  I only use filtered water, I am sure to let it stand for several hours so that it adjusts to room temperature and I use a water conditioner designed for betas.3.  Do not overfeed!4.  About once a month I carefully move my fish into another bowl with the most of the fish tank water and rinse out the tank.My fish seems very happy and loves swimming in, over, under, through and around the furniture exploring his environment.  He even sometimes lurks in the file cabinet!  His fins are long and beautiful and have never gotten caught on any ""sharp"" edges.The only concern I have for him is that he might eventually get bored since the furniture is locked down and can't be rearranged to provide stimulation for the fish.  But other than that, I think that with the proper care, a beta can be very happy living in his office.",0

As a woman who loves to cook and who loves to really get into the act of cooking, she has owned many aprons in the past. She has been quite impressed with the quality of workmanship from everything she received. Our only minor complaint was that not all lines carry all accessories, for example one apron only had the matching mitts, and not the pot holders also. But for the most part, CooknStyle has a wonderful collection.In addition to a very nice collection, they also provide free shipping over $60. And I was very impressed with their service.

5250,"Constantly in use in our house. My thoughtful guy stopped off at a Le Creuset outlet and called me from the store: ""Hey, I'm at the Le Creuset outlet and you can have anything you want!"" Oh, boy, it wasn't even my birthday. After consultation with the helpful sales assistant, we chose this casserole. It's large and flat like a skillet, has a domed cover, two side handles and it has the regular enamel lining. The sales assistant claimed it was the most used pot in her kitchen. I agree!We leave this out on the stove as it's rather large. We do a lot of things in it, but recently we made Swiss Steak. I am not a big Swiss Steak fan, but when someone comes home with the wrong meat for the grill (hint; you BRAISE round steak, not grill it) then you deal with it. I hammered flour into the steaks with the cubed side of the meat mallet. Then sauteed the meat in the Le Creuset casserole. I added minced onion, a can of diced tomatoes and let the whole thing simmer on the stove (though I could have finished it in the oven--this goes in the oven at moderate temperatures.) The result was a tender Swiss steak and with judicious stirring from time to time with a spatula to release the meat from the enamel surface, it was an easy cleanup.Unlike teflon, you do have to stir to avoid catching the food on the bottom. I find that a nylon spatula, shoved under the meat from time to time, releases it well. But I'd advise you never really leave this kind of pot to cook on its own even on the lowest heat unless you have a heat spreader or even heat. Our gas stove seems to create hot spots under the surface, so I keep an eye on it from time to time.The cleanup is easy--no abrasives or rough pads, please, but a good soaking cleans it up with a mild scrubbing nylon pad. The cream enamel does stain from tomato and caramelized foods, quick cleanup mitigates this, but over time, you will see some darkening. This bothers some people but as long as the surface is intact, we are ok with a bit of staining.If you do a lot of skillet cooking and like Le Creuset, this piece is wonderful and it can go from stove to tabletop because it is quite pretty",0
5251,"love it!. I used to have a Cuisinart, and I gave it to Goodwill after buying this Mandolin.  Yeah, the Cuisinart was great and it can do some things this can't, like making pesto.  But you know, I make pesto twice a year; I can use my mortar and pestle.   On the other hand, slicing things and making julienne strips is something both these do effortlessly, but I never used to take the cuisinart out to do it because the cleanup was such a hassle.  With this, its washed and dried in 20 seconds.  I find that I *actually* use this, instead of just owning it for &quot;someday&quot;.  The only caution I have is that blade is SHARP, so always use the guard",0

The touch controls are intuitive, so you don't have to drag out the book every time you want to reset it. It holds the heat at a very constant temperature, so the room temp doesn't go hot and cold like our old thermostat. I like that, if you overide the current setting which is very easy to do, it automatically goes back at the next schedule change. You don't have to remember to put it back on its schedule. I'd recommend it to someone else now while ours is new",0

5265,"Excellent Quality, Assembly, Durability, Usability, Value. This is the fourth size of these shelves I've gotten. One larger and two smaller - let's call this one 'large'. The X-large one was my first. It is one 6-shelf unit or two 3-shelf units. I use it as two units. It is loaded with heavy power tools, loaded tool boxes, etc and handles it with no problem. The medium sized ones are packed with garden supplies, gallons of paint, etc. The small one is loaded with gallons of bleach and detergents and softener bottles. This large size I use for boxes of house supplies - some heavy some lite. The product is as described and looks exactly like the picture.QUALITY = Zero defects with the legs, shelves, plastic height adjusters, wheel assemblies, welding and chrome plating. The design is simple and effective - the weight of the shelves and items of the shelves hold everything in place - no screws.ASSEMBLY = The instructions are poor but once you figure it out it is quick and easy and simply repetitive to put together. I've assembled all of mine by myself. The first x-large one I got took me an hour, now it takes me 10 minutes to put them together or tear them apart to change the shelf heights. No special tools required - all of mine came with a little wrench to tighten the wheel bolts. A rubber mallet proved handy to tighten the shelves down on the plastic adjusters (and to knock them loose to change the height as desired) but a shoe works as well. One corner of a shelf kept popping up and causing the plastic adjuster to pop off until I figured out I needed to get it on a level floor, square up the legs by twisting the whole unit a little, and whacked it with the mallet to wedge it down on the plastic adjuster. Caution: Don't step on any of the plastic height adjusters as you assmble it cause there are no extras to work with.DURABILITY = I can't imagine what I could put on it that would be heavy enough to break it. Compared to the laundry shelf/hanger unit I bought from a competitor these shelves are commercial strength. The laundry shelf wiggles and wobbles every time I touch it but these shelves are sturdy. Heavier than I expected too.USABILITY = Great. I definately prefer the models with wheels for ease in rearranging my basement storage and for cleaning around, etc. Even fully loaded with heavy items the x-large one is easy to move around with wheels. The shelves can be installed with the lip up or down. Stronger if the lip is down. Keeps things from falling off if the lip is up. The wheel locks work well (just place them both on a long side or opposite corners of each other). The shelf spacing is very flexible with grooves for the plastic height adjusters every inch or so. Excellent for workshops, garages, basements, pantry, and comtemporary or chef-quality kitchens - but not something I'd put in my living room - at least not in chrome. I'd probably lose the wheels if I were to put it in the kitchen to soften the look a bit.VALUE = I was pleasantly surprised. I looked at the plastic shelves which cost less but for me the wheels, the looks, the adjustable heights, and the  durability was worth the extra money. My sister has several versions of the plastic shelves in her basement and she doesn't like having to unload them or drag them across the floor to rearrange or clean. But if all you're going to store on them is boxes of bows and wrapping paper then these shevles are probably overkill. If I had a garage and/or a place for them in the kitchen I'd have more of them and put my heavy Kitchen-Aid mixer and the like on one of these",0
5266,"Great machine for office. Life at work wouldn't be quite the same without this and my shots of Buzzworthy.

You do have to clean it after every use but it can be rinsed and put in the dishwasher or just rinsed and dried.

5269,"Good size, occasional hot spot. I ordered this crock pot to replace an older version that didn't have a removable crock.What I like about it:- Crock is removable and dishwasher safe.- Size is perfect for 2-person meals.- Doesn't take up much storage space.- Glass lid allows you to see the contents.My concerns:- Seems to have a hot-spot on one side but it's only an issue if I leave the dish cooking longer than I should (such as if I get home from work really late.)- The lid doesn't look like it fits well; however, I don't think I'm losing any heat. So it might just be an aesthetic issue.I have used this crock pot 6 times in the past month and am very happy with it.  So far the ""hot-spot"" issue has affected two meals and I was able to just cut off the overcooked part. But that's the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.A general warning to anyone who is not familiar with crock pot cooking: the days of putting a dish in the crock pot before you leave for work and it being perfectly done when you return home are over, in my opinion. The new slow cookers/crock pots cook *much* faster and hotter than those our mothers owned in the 70's. My large, 5-quart Rival crock pot actually boils when I turn it on high! I suggest you experiment with yours on a weekend before you go off and leave it cooking unattended while you are at work for 9 or 10 hours. I find that if a crock pot recipe calls for cooking on low for 9 hours, it only takes 6 hours in my small or large crock pots.If you enjoy good oatmeal try the oatmeal recipe in the instruction manual.

5270,"Excellent shaker. I see a lot of people have leaky shakers.  Not me.  Mine is absolutely perfect.  The top/strainer piece fits snugly, leak-free, requiring just the right amount of effort to de-couple it from the canister.  The design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister.  The lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top.  The cap/jigger also fits perfectly, with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily",0

5272,"Awesome Fun, Great Value!. I bought this little thing about 1 week ago, and have been amazed.  It works great, comes with spare props, and is one of the slickest little toys I've ever seen.  It lasts for about 5 minutes on a charge, and takes about 10 minutes to charge.  The headlight flashes when the batteries are dying to warn you, but as the sub floats automatically, it's not really necessary.  Its two motors make it very maneuverable, although a little tricky as forward causes the sub to dive, and reverse raises it.  The fish in my pond and aquarium are mildly curious, and mildly annoyed by the sub.  So far, it's been fairly rugged, withstanding frequent use by me and my 10 year old sub.  Hard to beat at this price",0
5273,Pleasant surprise. This is a lovely product.  I would buy another one and also recommend it to my friends,0
5274,"Small problem with the large size. This set  has all the quality and good looks that I expected. There is only one problem-it is BIG! The 11&quot; plates are so tall in my dishwasher that they only fit in the center of my KitchenAid dishwasher, so I can't wash more than 4 at once, and the bowls don't slide in between the prongs, but kind of have to lean over, so that they take up extra space. I got the Rio set  partly because of the 16 oz. mugs (my husband is a serious coffee drinker!).  I love the design, but the plates and bowls are really way bigger than any person with a normal-size appetite needs",0
5275,"Very good cookware, but exterior is not dishwasher safe. The bodies are made of 1/8"" thick aluminum with a full stainless steel lining on the inside.  The thick aluminum bodies make them heat evenly and the stainless interior make them non-reactive with food.  My only gripes are that the rim of the pots have exposed non-anodized aluminum which become discolored with use.  And the anodized aluminum exteriors become discolored if washed in a dishwasher.  These are just cosmetic issues that don't affect the function, but I had higher expectations given the relatively high price of this set.  I also considered the All-clad cookware that has stainless steel cladding on both the interior and exterior.  In retrospect, perhaps those would have been a better choice assuming the thermal properties don't suffer too much from the exterior stainless steel coating.",0

So this year I am heading down to a ""pick-your-own"" farm with my husband and 5 daughters in search of some good old fashioned family fun!  This kit was exactly what I needed...not only comes with everything (except a few extra jars and the fruit) but also gives me a variety of recipes to try!  We used the coupons right away at Walmart to get the other few items we needed.***Also, this item was shipped and arrived so quickly I was shocked... unfortunately, it was damaged and I was afraid I couldn't get a replacement on time.

The 16"" circumference shoots a comfortable blast of cool air at you, and around you.2)Very well made. The whole unit is very sturdy [but not overbearingly heavy] and it doesn't vibrate when you have it on high.3)Very easy to use. The remote control makes it so you don't even have to leave your chair.All-in-all, a GREAT fan",0

It is perfectly balanced and very lightweight. The blade is super sharp so the carrots don't go flying off the cutting board while you're chopping them. My girlfriend especially liked the knife so I went on the Amazon and bought her one. Although I have never owned a quality knife before, so I cannot compare, I am very happy with this knife and would like to collect the entire set",0

It does take about 4"" clearance from back of tank to wall. So measure! I like the big sponge and the idea that the water has to start at the bottom and then go up through all the media, before going into the tank. Also, for leveling, you can use a piece of 3/4 inch tubing between the body of the filter and the aquarium, to make it level. I found that this works very well and stays in place. Just a helpful hint! LOL  When I get the courage to move my 55g tank away from the wall a little more, I am going to get another 110.",0

I inadvertently burnt out the motor on the first one by trying to chop some cheese using the food processor attachment.  Don't keep the motor going if the blade stops spinning because the food is too tough!  Shake it up or do less food at a time and try again.This is the only blender I have (I mostly use it for smoothies) and love having something small and efficient that gets the job done.  No big hunk of blender sitting around, and fewer materials needed to make and ship it.  Mixes stuff right in the container you want it in, avoiding more mess and cleanup, and when you're done, the mixing end twists off for easy washing.  Nice",0

Remember to use wooden (preferably) or plastic spoons with these pots as metal tools will scratch up the coating.  Handwash and dry, no dishwashers with these! They are expensive but when you figure that you will have these for life, and possibly your great-grandchildrens lives as well...they are well worth the investment.

5300,"This is a cast iron skillet. As a ceramic cooktop owner who loves cast iron, I had to invest in some enameled cast iron.  (Unenameled cast iron may scratch the surface.) I chose Le Creuset.  I enjoy cooking with all the Le Creuset skillets and pots that I own.  I have noticed some comments here that compelled me to write this review.  The black seen in the pan is not teflon, but black cast iron.  Cast iron skillets come either seasoned or unseasoned.  I have ones that stick worse than others.  I can't explain it, but if the surface looks dull and gray as opposed to shiny and black, it probably needs to some grease added to it.  I usually just spray with cooking oil  prior to cooking for easier cleanup.  I'm just guessing.  Directions for that may be found on the Lodge cast iron website.  Lodge now offers an enameled cast iron line as does Nordic Ware, but Le Creuset seems to be on sale more often and offered in more places.  Also to avoid cracking the porcelain enamel, follow the manufacturer's instructions about allowing the pan to cook down to room temperature.  Extreme temperature changes may crack the glaze.  I will say these are really heavy pans and I have had to strategize on which shelves they can go.",0

Every batch I've made has been great, even with occasional differences. I enjoy eating my yogurt plain, but I also love topping it with  fresh fruit, nuts and maybe a touch of granola.  Sooo good.I prefer the boil method of preparation, but there is a non-boil method as well. Try them both and see which you prefer.I highly recommend buying a box of spare jars too.  It adds to the cost, but this will allow you to start a new batch without having to wait to use and clean up the jars from the previous batch.  It will also provide you with spare parts, which I discovered the hard way.  I somehow lost a lid from the original set about two months after I got the yogurt maker.  If I hadn't had the extra jars, I would now have a yogurt maker that makes six jars of yummy yogurt, rather than seven.Speaking of yogurt, I think I'll go get some now! Yum",0

5305,Smaller than it looks which is better!. I purchased this as a gift for my son who loves anything dipped in chocolate. He had his eye on the much larger fountains. I wanted something smaller that he could use without making a big mess. I also did not want 3 pounds of chocolate melted at once. This little pot is perfect for that reason. You melt 1 1/2 cups of chips or whatever type of chocolate you want. This will allow you to dip over 2 pounds of strawberries and numerous pretzels from one batch. Because of it's size and ease of use it has been pulled out several times already. I highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a smaller chocolate fondue pot. Think of it as a mini crock pot as that's what it reminds me of most.,0

Has great hand feel and I think it will last a good long time.  (I'll post an edit to this review if it doesn't!)2. Opens a wide variety of containers and should serve my Mom well with 90% of her opening needs.3) The portion of this tool that grips the lid to be opened has a semi-tacky feel and provides a good hold on the interior of the tool.Con:1. The exterior handle, where your hand contacts the tool, could be prone to slipping.  It's hard textured plastic with no rubber gripping surfaces and that concerns me.Again, this is based on a good amount of Thanksgiving usage, but no long term tests so far.  I'll re-post if this review changes based on my Mom's experience.-We",0
5313,"Great for the office!. I've had it for several months now, using it daily, and it's performed very well! Here is the deal with temperatures. If you place a hot cup of tea/coffee on it, it keeps it hot! Not the burn your tongue hot. As you drink, the cup becomes less full, and actually heats the contents more. Also, I've placed a half full cup of cold coffee on it, and it heated it up to a nice warm temperature within a few minutes. The heating plate will accommodate larger coffee mugs. The only disadvantage I've noticed with it is the counter gets rather warm were it is placed, so keep flammables and paper away to be safe. Also it does not have a auto shutoff that I'm aware of, however I have it plugged into a power box with motion control, so if I leave my desk for a long period it will shut off. I also try to make sure the bottom of my mug is dry before setting the cup down on it, to keep the heating plate clean. So if your like me and like sipping on tea or coffee at the office, with out going to refill for a hot cup every time your liquids get cold, then you'll be happy with this warmer",0

5315,"Still learning... Having never worked at a Starbucks or otherwise, I only knew that I liked boutique coffees more than Folgers, et al.. Trusting the products lines of the local gourmet Kitchen Store, I tried many of their machines on display, noting ease of use as well as the final product. In many cases it came down to the obvious, personal taste and the particular ""roast"" being used. Trying to spend my $4.00/day specialty coffee money on a machine that would appeal to design, ease of use, reputation, functionality and most of all the coffee it ultimately produced made the JURA/Swiss made extremely attractive. I realize nearly $2000 for a coffee machine seems a little crazy to many, but you do the math. The short list included the slightly more expensive S8 with the dual heating elements for shorter down time, but the touch control LED won out for me. No looking back, I've been extremely pleased with the F9 and the automated promps are a ""no-brainer"".",0

The sharpening action is very easy, just run the knife through the first slot a few time then through the second slot a few more and with the aid of the electric motor my knives come out sharper then when new. I've used this sharpener 40 or so times now and it still puts a fantastic edge on my knives.

5319,"AMAZING. Hands down the absolute best cookware Ive ever tried, and I LOVE to cook!Ok so the debate about teflon getting hot and gassing off is scary. Swiss Diamond says they dont have the same problem as everyone else with the diamond coating, who really knows. The good news is that the diamonds really do work.They say they transfer heat better...oh ya. I have to cook with lower heat, so for me that pretty much lessens the hot teflon scare.The top of the skillet is just as hot as the bottom so the claim about heat transfer is true. Its amazing! They have the coating on the outside as well, I presume to transfer the heat quickly and uniformly.They say diamonds are slick... for sure. I can fry and egg with no oil, well allmost none, and come out sunny side up without breaking.Its thick, and cast. Pretty heavy, but thats a good thing for us. Its ok because the handle fits your hand. The vent is a great idea, and why anyone would make a lid you cant see thru doesnt get my hard earned buck!I am sold on German power tools, and use nothing else but German or Japaneese tools. ( no that does not incude Chinese)Now Im sold on Swiss cookware.  I will still never use a metal utensil even if they say its ok, because I dont want down time for a new skillet!I love this thing and would highly recomend it!I find myself planning dinner on what I can cook in my new tool!!!You will fall in love the minute you take it out of the box and hold it in your hand.

5320,"Good job Drinkwell!!!. I have two cats and I definteley spoil them rotten!  When I first decided to get a water fontain for my cats I chose the Petmate Freshflow over the Drinkwell because the Drinkwell was more expensive and I was completely against the idea of listening to running water all day.  Unlike most customers I've heard from the Petmate worked farily well as a water BOWL.  It was easy to clean and my pump never stopped working as I've read many others did.  However, the water running down the little ramp really didn't satisfy my cats.  They did drink from it, but they would still jump at any chance to drink running water out of a faucet which is the whole reason I started thinking about getting them one in the first place.  About a ear and a half later I started thinking about getting them a new one and possibly going with the more expensive Drinkwell this time.  I saw the new Drinkwell Platinum and decided to go with it right away.  The Platinum is more expensive than both the previous models I was looking at but it is definteley worth the extra cost.  It's like Drinkwell took all the criticism and praise for both thier design and their competitors and created an exceptional pet drinking fontain.  I have had my Platinum for about 5 months now and have been very pleased with it.  The Drinkwell team designed the water outlet so that it would minimize the water from braiding which cuts down on the water noise. In fact at the setting I have mine, about mid way between low and mid level, I can't hear it at all!  They also put a little debris trap before the water even gets to the pump which should greatly increase the pumps life.  The water resevoir is also much bigger than that of my Petmate and the Drinkwell's optional larger resevoir on their original design.  All and all I veiw this as a time where a company actually went out there and designed their product by what thier customers wanted!!!  So after reading all that you maybe wondering why I only gave this product 4 stars.  Well the one thing that I would really like to see is that the actual bowl area be made of stainless steel or some ceramic mix which is totally what I have been told by several vets is the BEST material for any pet to be drinking/eating out of.  If they were to add that one extra feature than I would give this 5 stars out of 5 hands down!!!!!",0

I will admit I did not have high hopes for this $99 unit, though it promises to clean throughly I thought sure, thats what they all say, well I can tell you, this one actually does what it says it will! I washed my floor with the Swiffer mop, I waited till the floor dried and went over it with this unit you can not beleive the dirt that was on the units mop head. What really impressed me was when I lifted the rug next to the exposed tile and both colors matched, which meant the floor was just as clean as tile that had not been exposed to shoes. If this works this good on ceramic tile on high traffic areas I know this will be great for all its other uses.",0

5324,"I can still have kids!. I have had a Lapinator for six months now and it has performed exceptionally. It may not do much, but it does it well. Comfortable and lightweight, it works well while travelling or just as a desk to allow ventilation. The rubber pads adhere well and provide a decent grip. Virtually all heat is absorbed. As a bonus, any future children of mine will have this device to thank for allowing me to retain the means to procreate them.My only concerns: The questionable product name that seems hokey for a device of such simple elegance (my apologies to the inventor, who contacted me after my purchase and seems quite nice), and the size which does not allow me to pack it in my 15"" laptop bag (but that is to be expected)",0
5325,"Excellent coffee. First, let me say that this product makes excellent coffee. I usually regret drinking regularly-brewed coffee because of the acid, but I've been drinking this cold-brewed coffee for two weeks now and have had NO ill after effects.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's basically just a couple of pieces of plastic, and so I'd consider it fairly overpriced for what you get.What you get is: a plastic carafe with snap-on lid, a container to put ground coffee in, a filter pad, and another container to put water in. Water empties through a small hole into the container with the ground coffee in it, and you let it sit over night. In the mornning, pop the cork out of the coffee container (on the bottom), and let the syrup drain into the carafe (through an included filter pad). That's it. You could, if you were motivated enough, make one of these out of those x-large soda cups from 7-11.But, the coffee is excellent. I've been using it to make iced coffee, and it's wonderful. One part syrup, 2-3 parts milk, a shot of chocolate syrup - and you've just saved yourself $5 from Starbucks. It's that good.It's easy to use, easy to clean, you only have to use it once every week or so (depending on how much coffee you drink), and the coffee is excellent. And it has low acid, to boot.(Disclaimer: I like mellower roasts of coffee. I've never been a fan of very strong, dark roasts - and that may factor into my appreciation of cold-brewed coffee. Smooth is how I'd describe it.)",0

5336,"The ultimate kitchen knife. I must say this is one fantastic knife.  It is the knife I usually use when prepping a meal (sandwiches don't count).  When I purchase a knife, I always personally sharpen it, so I can't really speak for the factory edge, but it accepts and holds an edge wonderfully.  Having the extra wide knife (along with added heft) has more of a curve to it allowing for an easy chopping motion.  I have purchased Henckel Pro S in the past and, after noticing a couple of flaws that passed their QC in my expensive knives, I will never purchase one without personally inspecting it first.  Wusthof has much better QC so I have no problem ordering them through the mail.FYI-This knife needs a large cutting board and a serious knife block to hold it.  I personally use the Wusthof 25-slot ""mega"" block and it fits in all three of the top chef knife positions. Overall this knive is an investment, but you will love it!",0

I have NO problem cleaning it at all! As soon as I am done frying something, I put some water in the pan. Whatever might be stuck to it comes right off...even better than with a non-stick surface.

It's sturdy and I was so pleased I ordered 3 more to block the dogs from other areas of the house.  It's very easy to step over, too.Probably wouldn't work for large dogs or hyper little dogs that jump.  But my little dogs see the gate and walk off and ignore it",0

5346,"By far the BEST coffee maker I've ever owned... Who wouldn't want to wake up every morning and have not only freshly-brewed, but freshly-ground coffee waiting for them???  No, we don't have a butler...  we have a Coffee Team!Ok... I'll admit the price of this coffee maker seemed a little high in the beginning.  My husband is a coffee fanatic and I wanted to get him a coffee maker for his birthday that would hopefully last longer than 6 months and reduce his morning coffee-making time.Immediately after discovering the Coffee Team I started doing the math on how many Starbucks drive-thru trips my husband could make for the price of this coffee maker and realized that in the end this would be more cost-effective for our budget.I can't say enough about the quality of this coffee maker.  I was initially skeptical as the coffee pot part appeared to be similar to several of the other no-longer-functioning coffee makers we have lying around our garage.  I will admit that there isn't anything super-fancy about the actual coffee-maker part itself, but it is the incredible attached burr grinder, water filter and array of digital settings that sets this coffee maker apart.It comes with a manual and a video.  We never watched the video, but we did study the manual to figure this thing out.  Once you get your settings right and make a couple of pots of coffee, it is really quick and easy to whip up a pot of fabulous coffee.I love to drink coffee, but was notorious for making coffee too strong or too weak.  Also, I could never really figure out how much to grind to make the perfect coffee.  The Coffee Team really makes it easy to make a great cup of coffee without having to over-think it!We love the three separate strength settings (mild, medium and strong) which actually change the flavor (unlike some of the other coffee pots we've tried).  This really comes in handy when we switch from milder to richer beans.  We also appreciate the ability to switch the number of cups we make with the touch of a button.  It also has a reminder light to change the water filter (which I need!).  I never realized how much water quality affected coffee, but now I can definitely tell when the filter needs to be replaced.  I was a little skeptical about having to buy replacement filters, but they are only $10 for a 3-pack sold here at Amazon.  Spend more than $25 and they'll ship 'em to you for free!I will warn you that when you switch coffee brands or flavors you may need to make small adjustments to the settings for different beans, but ultimately this coffee pot always makes a great cup of coffee!I highly recommended the Coffee Team as the ultimate gift for the coffee-lover in your life!!",0

It's simple -- you plug it in and flip the switch (a light turns on to let you know it's working).It heats very quickly, &lt;5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea, it heats in about 3.For students in dorms, you can use it for oatmeal, soup, tea.  Automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute, so no worries about fire hazards.  Great product, I use it every day.",0
5349,"I like it!. We had an ancient Kitchen Aid and I loved it... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky.  Our daughter now has it and is happy with it.  We bought the Hamilton Beach mixer and I like it almost as much as the Kitchen Aid.  The best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up, making things a bit easier.  The only slight complaint I have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump... it's a little too fast for what I want, most of the time.  Another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter",0

5353,"Well-made, generous sized; makes roasting nearly fool-proof. Fabrication quality is very good, with polished exterior, machine-turned base, sturdy handles, and thick walls. Because it's aluminum, it's not so heavy that handling it becomes awkward.Slip even a large bird with ease into this roaster, sprinkle with spices, pour a can of chicken broth into the bottom, and roast in a 325-degree oven for three and a half to four hours with the lid on. Then raise the temp to 350 and take the lid off for another 15 minutes or so. Your bird is perfectly moist throughout, delicately crisped on top, and clean-up is quick and easy.What's not to like?",0
5354,"Highly Functional!. I purchased this colander for my mother's birthday after the paint chipped on her last much ""fancier"" colander.What I like about this stainless steel colander:-It's five quarts. My mother's last colander only held three quarts, which is really inadequate if you are cooking a spaghetti dinner for more than a few people.-It's functional. The stainless steel won't break, won't chip, and won't rust. It's sturdy and reliable.-It's more than functional. Hey, the colander has a cute fruit pattern. It's unnecessary, it's not spectacular, but why not! It adds visual interest to what would otherwise be a fairly basic colander.What I don't like about this colander:-It's a little wide. Its width makes the colander hard to store. You can hang the colander from a hook on your backsplash if kitchen space is an issue.",0
5355,"A bit too big but excellent quality. I purchased two of these hampers for my daughters age 9 and 5.  I have had them for a few months now and, so far, there is no damage to them!

They are very cute and the quality is excellent",0

I tell people forget the iron, just get this steamer. You can use it on almost all fabrics, unless the label states don't use steam. I even take it when I travel, because it is pretty light weight.",0

Unlike some Tupperware products, you can't just throw this in a tote bag and expect it to not leak at all if it goes somewhat vertical. BUT, that said, for the price, it's great. Love the fact that it's entirely see-through. Perfect for taking leftovers for lunch to work.",0

5362,"First to review... what you pay for is what you get. Hello all amazon users,First person to review this item leaves a so-so favorable impression.  The image is deceiving as you do not get a glass lid with the wok.  Handles are not wooden but rather 2 stubby iron wings that you grab on to.  Other than that, this sucker is heavy.  Good in the send that when you are actually stir frying your stuff, you are not moving the wok around.  The base is pretty thick so heat will be uniformly dispersed.  What you pay for is what you get,  I can't complain.  Add on the 25 off 125 purchase so it's a good deal.",0
5363,"What a great indulgence!. After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.I would recommend this with no caveats",0
5364,"Corningware success. The mug alone costs 6.99, so the kit for 16.99 is a bargain. I love the mug size, its handle and vent lid. I would prefer an on and off button for the warmer, but it does keep my coffee warm. I don't know if I'll ever use the lunch bag but it is well made",0
5365,"Easiest Ice Cream ever. I was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker, but when it arrived it was just like brand new, including all original packing, perfect. I was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately, but again, it was quite strong in this regard, and froze the mixtures perfectly. Admittedly, doesn't make a huge amount, but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine MORE than makes up for it. And it's WAY quieter than the old fashioned freezers. ALSO it was half the price of a new one. BUY IT!",0

5368,"works well enough. This sharpener does not work with a thick blade. However, it is fantastic for your thinner bladed knifes. Steak, pocket, paring, everyday chopping knifes come out very sharp.The only complaint I have is, after going thru the initial sharpening stage; using the second and third wheels result in kicking out the blade about 3/4 way thru. Similar to a table saw kicking out lumber back at you. Mine is new and has only seen use once (all of my knifes), and I don't know if there's a ""breaking in"" period. It'll be awhile before I use it again because it works quite well. But for now I would recommend it",0

So much fun just to look at, let alone dip into, and there are so many possibilities for types of dipping items. Plus, although there were a lot of pieces to clean, everything breaks down easily and cleans quite simply. We're looking forward to trying it with cheese, too. Just make sure to read the directions and maintenance warnings before using it, to be sure it works properly, and lasts a long time. This is definitely a fantastic item to own, and entertain with",0
5371,"fast means hot. I have had 3 microwave rice cooker before this. They were always hard to meet my satisfaction, andante, that was the problem.The last one was even from Thailand from my trip and it did not work well, either.But when I found this from here, I wanted to test if it works any better. I noticed the cone shaped bottom. And, I think it makes the difference after all.I cooked rice in it either with the zatarain's prepared rice sachet or any rice for steaming. they all turned out great. If it is getting dry-because each microwave has different wattages, you have to figure out how long it takes to cook great sticky rice. If the rice turns out too dry, I just add one cup of water and boil for another min. and simmer it. Never ever failed once.The reason for 4 star is for pop corn issues. I followed the instruction for the right amount and the time. But it would only pop the half of it in  2.5min. And, I have to empty the first popped corns and run for another 2 min to pop the rest. But then again, I have Panasonic Microwave (Panasonic NN-T795SF Full-Size 1.6-Cubic-Foot 1,250-Watt) and some reviewer below already warned that popping corn in Panasonic could be disastrous. And, I am watching it all the time.The popping corns left some brown mark at the bottom but the container itself is really sturdy and would not get stained from zatarain's rice.So, for rice cooking mainly, I would recommend this steamer",0

5374,"Toast  comes out like it's been sunning in St. Tropez!. First let me say that I decided on this oven because I refuse to spend a lot on another toaster oven.  They don't live a long time (except for the Cuisinart), and so why spend top dollar?  I love this oven.  I also purchased it at Costco ($60.00).  It was replacing my old, would never buy again Delonghi Toaster Oven, and a Panasonic Infrared Toaster Oven that went right back to Amazon after 3 days. The only thing that compares is the Cuisinart convection toaster oven that I had.  It was THE PERFECT TOASTER OVEN, but a little too small for our needs.  If you don't need a big oven, don't mess with anything else and get the Cuisinart!Yes, it takes eons to make toast in this baby.  (Way more than 6 minutes.  Most often between 8-11 minutes!) It's a big oven.  But, unlike the other reviewer, my toast, no matter what kind of bread, turns out perfectly golden like my bread was sitting out in St. Tropez. The rack must be in the center position and shaped like a ""U"" when looking at it from the front for the perfect slice. It also can handle nearly 6 full english muffins at one time. (Great for big families.)  I have also found that it will toast things one right after another without getting increasingly browner with each batch. (But it does get faster, with each successive batch.)I would like having the unit interior 1/2"" larger from side to side.  It will nearly fit a 9""x13"" pan, I mean by less than 1/3""!...which would be great in summer to almost never use my big oven.  So, I'm not sure why the manufacturer wouldn't have gone the extra 1/2"".  I mean, it's already a huge oven...might as well go for it.  If you are a small family, or have a super small kitchen, this oven might not be for you.  I have a small kitchen, but a family that likes to eat, so this oven, while taking a lot of space, does a lot of work for us, and is worth it.The bell when toast is done, is not that loud.  So, if you are in another part of the house doing something, you might not hear it.I have made toast, 12"" pizza, baked potatoes, fries and chicken strips, muffins, cookies, brownies, roasted chicken, and more in this oven.  They all came out beautiful.I don't like that I can't tell when it is up to temperature for baking, so I have an instant read thermometer to tell me when it is ready.  (And yes, it takes forever to get up to temp.) My oven temp is lower than what it reads on the digital touch screen, but it has not adversely affected my baking.So, with those caveats, I still love this toaster oven.  I can't recommend it for everyone, but if you identify with my likes and dislikes in this review, you will like this machine",0
5375,"Excellent for Saving Space!. I bought this power station because my husband and I had charging cords all over the place.  Our phones and my PDA were being charged in all ends of the house.  This thing is really great!  It keeps the cords neatly inside it, only requires one electrical outlet and is also a handy little holder for the items charging.  Most everyone who has seen it at work at our house has been equally impressed with it.  I highly recommend it for the organizationally challenged.  Everything you need to charge will be in one place and ready to go",0

I've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at $60 to $75 a pop so last summer I decided to try it myself with this clipper kit.  To make a long story short, she didn't turn out so bad! (Well, the neighbors didn't laugh, anyway!) It took me a while to get the hang of it--I finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers--but she didn't complain and I had a ""cool"" dog for much less $$$ than a pro cut.  The best part was I could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back.  No report as yet how long the blades last, but I'm already money ahead even if I must replace them next year",0

I bought other pillows, but still used the old feather/down one on top, next to me.The old feather/down pillow has now gone to its reward and I am sleeping luxuriously with FOUR of these wonderful pillows. I didn't need four, but they look beautiful, plump, and succulent on my bed (I do go on !)You will not be disappointed....and there is NO SMELL, the Royal Velvet cover feels like a fine fabric, and they even come in their own individual plastic zipper tote..complete with handle !",0
5384,"Love it!. It was a little tricky to put together by myself, and the instructions could have been clearer....but now it's done, and I LOVE my new sofa!  It's so much nicer than I expected to get for this price.  I highly recommend the matching tables, too",0
5385,"Very pleased, Great for larger Tanks. I have a 90 gallon tank and sometimes I don't want to perform a water change to get the bottom of the tank clean. I had the multi-vac previously. I have no issues with that except over time, the pieces won't stay together. I bought the sludge extractor (PETCO) and I love it. It reaches to the bottom of my tank and I didn't have to drain any water. The pressure on the vacuum was more than adequate. I was a bit relunctant on the proce, but I'm happy I did buy it and would recommend it to others. Just shop around for the lowest price",0
5386,"Good quality. I bought these because I wanted silicone trivets, but it was cheaper to get a set of potholders.  Actually I haven't seen any that are cheaper, especially since you mostly only have the option of buying one at a time.  I love that they double as potholders, trivets, and jar openers.  I wasn't convinced they'd make a good jar opener, but I tried it and they work!  I gave the product four stars only because as trivets I don't think they are the best looking to have on your dining table",0
5387,"Amazing Sheet Pan. This was the first non- nonstick pan that I bought and it has converted me. I use this more often than any other pan in my kitchen. If you want to make biscuits or scones and you don't want the bottom to burn, you must use one of these.",0
5388,"Pet Training Mat. I got this mat for my Bengal Cat Tristan who loves to jump on my counters. The mat has three setting, Low, Medium and High. The first time he jumped up and landed on the mat(I used the low  setting)he went up in the air and re-landed on the mat with all four paws. He did not go into the kitchen for a day and we bribbed him with treats at that. He stood and staired at the counter but did not jump back up. The mat has a mild shock on low and we have leaned on it ourselves and gotten shocked but it is enough for him not to jump up again on it. It takes some time to break the habit,and I have other counters still to do. But it works great. The only down side it when leaving on the counters everytime you need to use the counter you have to turn off the mat and move it. I don't have a lot of counter space so this effects me more than some I am sure",0
5389,warm. Love it..so warm and great quality..great price...it is exactly what I have been looking for,0
5390,"The best book light ever. I got two (black and silver), one for my daughter and one for myself. We both like them. It is very bright (both pages completely covered!), easy on eyes and as a bonus batteries last a long time. Turns on fast, clips on a book very easy and secure. A bit bulky to carry around but quality of the light worth it. Very well made",0
5391,"Big, Loud, but makes a difference. The difference in the air quality is noticable.  I haven't tried to clean it yet, but it looks like it shouldn't be too difficult.  One gripe is the blue led's.  Would be nice to turn them off but still use the functionality (especially since they are purely for decoration",0
5392,"A great starter piece or addition to your Le Creuset collection. Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way.Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. It is recommended to use low to medium heat when cooking with cast. There are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Otherwise, cooking with high heat may cause food to stick, discolor the enamel coating, or cook the food unevenly. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well.Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain it. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood.The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the soup pot specifically. 4 1/4 quarts is not a whole lot of space when it comes to making soups, consider your recipes when determining the size you need. The soup pot tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the pot's evenly dispersed heat.The pot has flat bottom that broadly curves up the sides to 4 inches high making stirring your soup simple.  Atop internal diameter of about 10 1/2 inches makes for a wide top allowing room for a whole chicken. The tight fitting lid is slightly angled sealing in heat, moisture, and flavors. Use the lid to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings, or holding your prepared vegetables while creating your culinary feast. Its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan. I tend to cook large amounts so this pan is usually used for mole de pollo, chili con carne, chicken and dumplings, tomato sauce, and soups.Once you get beyond the basic functionality, the soup pot can really open up the possibilities. Keep in mind this is a 4 1/4 quart pan with about a 10 1/2 inch diameter, perhaps the optimal pan for families from 2-4. Some possibilities for this pan besides soups include rice pilaf, roasted chicken, braising, steamed artichokes, Jell-O molds, and assembling a baked Alaska.One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive, compared to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. These heavy pans then go through an enameling process before being shipped. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.PROS:Efficient absorption and distribution of heatHygienic enamel cooking surfaceDoes not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavorsEasy to clean when not abused or misusedCan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the tableCan easily last a lifetimeCONS:Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10 pounds",0
5393,"great coffee maker. This is a great little coffee maker. I was extremely impressed with this item. It works great and is a great value. I keep it in my office and I love it. It is easy to use, easy to clean and works like a machine that costs twice the price. I like the options of using either the pods or regular coffee grounds. I haven't had any problems with this product",0
5394,"Great Match. Even when I bought the Fiestawere Cinnabar creamer I loved it right away, but to order the Cinnabar Covered Suger Bowl from a nother seller and have them match so well.  I am so happy that my sugar bowl is such a perfect match. Thank",0
5395,"These work great. Their design makes them easy to get in and out, and the company that sells them through Amazon is prompt and easy to deal with",0
5396,"It does its job well - there are things to note. I like this product and I use it nearly every day - it goes well with a french press, and heating water to 200 deg F is its primary function. At other times I used it to help a large pot of water (for cooking pasta) come to a boil much sooner.Things to note:- The brushed exterior is convenient, it doesn't pick up smudges like a polished one would- The 2qt capacity is great when boiling water for a larger pot- It's fast. It gets water to a boil very quickly, especially if you don't fill the whole pot - 1qt will boil really quickly, not just in half the time of 2qts- The indicator window gets steamed and is barely of use. OK, I see how much to not fill it (Max line)- The switch appears flimsy but there's not much to stress it- A subtle red light indicates the switch is on. Initially I used to leave the switch on after pouring out the water, but now I know what to look for. At this point I don't regret that it could have been brighter, because it stays subtle in the kitchen. In a multi-user kitchen you might want to mention that the ON indication is very low-key.- When boiling, the kettle takes a bit more delay than I'd expect to switch off and indicate the water's boiling (with a quiet click). By that time the sound of bubbling alerts me- I haven't detected any weird smell, I did two boils with fresh water before using it- The spout is definitely designed for slow pouring. It doesn't spill a drop. However, if you're trying to dump the water out really fast, like into a large pot, slow down or you'll get a trickle down the sides because the spout won't handle the volume- There's a fine mesh filter across the spout to catch any scaling if it ever occurs (not seen it yet but I have an undersink filter) and I remove that to stick a thermometer to catch it short of boiling. Would have been nice to get something where I could simply set the temperature rather than monitor the kettle - but that would be a different product altogether.- The lid is nice, opens gently- I wondered whether I could heat vegetable stock in it, but I think that better be left to the 670 or 675 that you see on Good Eats - the electric hot pot that looks like a kettle but with perfectly vertical sides. This has a tube in it and its shape won't lend well to thorough cleaning. I'll stick to water.- It feels like it sits loose on the base, but that's what makes it easy to pick up and put down. The base doesn't get lifted with the kettle, so it's nice in that. The cord is solid and has a three-pronged plug at the end.All in all, it feels solid and can do what it's supposed to do. I fault it a star for trickling when I try to pour the water very quickly, and for the odd placing of the level indicator, the difficulty of being able to reach in and deep clean anything. I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars if that was possible",0
5397,"Wilton course 1 book. If you are like me unable to take Wilton course 1 class or just want to get a head start before taking the class. This book is a great investment for you. All the method taught in course 1 class are given here with step by step color picture. If you don't are unable to master the skills that is fine, just practice and practice you will be ok (I suggest you use a large flat dinner plate instead of the practice board, its much easier to clean up or re-use the buttercream).I learned how to make butter cream roses and shells thanks to this book in addition to wilton's website video. I suggest everyone to invest on this book (you can always sell it later if you no longer want it).",0

It did give off quite alot of lint when I washed it but that did not affect the quality of the item.  The duvet also did not shrink and I have washed it several times so far.  If you are looking for something to keep you warm and cozy I highly recommend this item, for the price it cannot be beat",0

5401,"great for wool rugs, upholstery. This is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go.  It's not a quick removal tool (think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming), but for things like wool dhurrie rugs, it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things.  It really does pull up tons of fur, even from deep in a rug",0

5403,Love this mug!. I've had a set of 4 of these mugs and LOVE them. They are green rather than clear. They hold just the right amount of coffee and the flared top helps prevent accidental spilling unless you like to fill your mug to the brim. I'm looking for a replacement for one of them which had to be disposed of because the bottom cracked when it was left on a mug warmer when it was empty. Looks like I may have to buy a complete of 6,0
5404,"A great coffeemaker. Because of its design, this coffeemaker isn't subject to the kind of clogging that plagues most one-cup coffeemakers. The arrangement of drip holes in the cone is downright ingenious -- no buttons to push or levers to press. And it turns itself off when it's finished. I think it's terrific",0
5405,"Good for the price. PROS: Works well. Heats fast, auto-shutoff feature and visible water level are nice.CONS: Putting kettle on base requires lining up 3 slots which takes a little extra care and might result in damage to contacts if you're not careful.",0
5406,"Great for Musicians. I use this for my brass ensemble ([...], we often play in chirches with few light, this LED lights are just what we need, they are really bright (and white lights) and cover both music sheets on the music stand. They also last very long with 3 AAA batteries",0
5407,"Does liquids well. I've only had mine for a little over a week, but I've already used it for chopping, slicing, and lots of pureeing.The unit is sturdily built, heavy and powerful, just as others describe.But I want to comment on liquid jobs. If you are considering this unit for liquids, don't be scared off by the negative reviews. The shaft does indeed only rise halfway up in the bowl (this allows the minibowl and blade to sit on top/inside of the main bowl), so you cannot fill the unit to the top with liquid and expect it to be completely leak-free.On the other hand, I've made mayonnaise, pureed for thin soup and made baba ganoush, and I did not end up with liquid/food all over the counter. I had barely a leak, and when I did, it was because I was stil learning the position the blade had to be in for removal, and so when it pulled off, a little leaked through the bowl hole.It *is* important to not fill liquids too high, though this is true of any mixer/processor. Imagine trying to mix cake batter with a spoon in a bowl that you had filled too high -- stuff will fly out! The same is true of a processor.However, that does not reduce it to a 4-cup capacity as someone claimed. I made a thin pureed soup and got more than 7 cups out of it. The bowl hole is about halfway up, so you won't get much more than that unless it's thick (like my baba ganoush).Anyway, use some common sense and this excellent product will treat you fine. But if you need to be able to process 8 or 10 or more cups of thin liquid at a time, you need to buy a larger unit than this one",0
5408,"Amazing Vacuum. I like to clean.  I don't like a lot of noise.  This vacuum cleans beautifully when it's not even on full power.  I have bare floors and rugs, it handles both with ease.  I did purchase the brush head for rugs, although I'm not sure I needed to.  However, I am happy I did, since I like a thorough clean.  I've used shop vacs in the past, more inexpensive run of the mill vacs and for tough construction jobs, I'd use a shop vac.  Only beacause I wouldn't want to ruin the miele.  The miele is very powerful however and very quiet.  We have a 2 month old and she is soothed when I use it.  You can't beat the design as well, it's really pretty.  Anyhoo, I read some review where the person was upset they had to buy the brush extension for their rugs.  Well, I'm glad I did and I don't see myself getting another vacuum for years, which will end up in an overall savings",0
5409,"Great for little ones!. I have to say I LOVED these at first, but after only a few months of use all of mine have broke. The little white sticks that shape the box broke through the seems at the top. I could stitch them closed...but now my kids think they are for sword fighting. I am disappointed. I would still give them 5 stars if they held up but now I would have to go down to 1.I wasn't sure if this would work for my 2 yr old because they collapse. To my suprise they are working BETTER...the biggest problem I have is him dumping his toys flipping over the toy boxes and standing on them. This is not very safe right...since the top of the dresser is usually where he goes :)Whats worse is you spend 5 or 6 bucks on the plastic ones and he stands on the side and breaks them, and they take up alot of space. These boxes are primary colors perfect for kids, large and they can't stand on them because they just won't hold a kids weight...perfect for me. When you open them up be careful to check inside because they are packed with silica gel bags...each of mine had 2. NOT GOOD EATS for a toddler. I think they are great and I am getting a few more",0

The machine is easy to use and makes a great cup of espresso with a great crema.  I have used both the pods and my own espresso, and both come out great.  The frother works very well also.  The only negatives are that the cup warmer on the top doesn't seem to work (but I don't think I would use it anyway), it is larger than I had hoped and I have limited counter space, and the reservoir doesn't hold a great deal of water. Overall, I would highly recommend this machine.",0

I would definitely get another one in a different color when they are available,0
5420,"I love this pan, great grilled sandwiches. I received this pan today and I love it.  It made two fantastic sandwiches in less than 5 minutes.  The bread was crispy and had nice dark grill marks without being burnt.  The lid is heavy enough to compress the sandwich without any additional pressing.If you have a large family this pan might be a little small.  I made two large sandwiches (approx 4 by 8 inches) with focaccia bread and had room for maybe one more sandwich.This pan was very simple to clean as well.  Cheese that melted in the interior of the pan easily released after soaking in warm water for 5 minutes.The exterior of the pan is enameled, as the description states.  However, the interior of the pan appears to be seasoned cast iron, not enamel as is reflected in the description.  This in no way detracts from the functionality of the pan.  I prefer the cast iron to the enamel. Properly seasoned cast iron is more non-stick than enamel.I would highly recommend this pan to anyone that wants to make panini but doesn't want another appliance to sit on the counter",0
5421,Great Can Opener. Great can opener but doesn't have the knife sharpening feature other openers in the same price range have,0
5422,"Overall a good set. Fortunately, ours didn't break during shipment.  I am not too crazy about this pattern, but still bought this set just b/c it was the best one available in my price range.  They are quite heavy (a bit too heavy for everyday use) and will last a long time.  I really like the large bowl and especially the design of the lids!  The lids are so light and easy to grab, place and remove.  The flat design makes it easy to store in your fridge, which to me is a big plus over those bulky traditional corningware glass lids",0

5428,"Just right for me. This did the trick for me.  It's fine for holding several skillets, grill baskets and even a wok.  I have hung one wok, one 6"" skillet, one 12"" skillet and one 14"" skillet on it, along with a grill basket in the back. I believe there will be no issues with adding many more and it looks good and does not ""stick out"" too far in my small kitchen.  In fact, it adds a touch of decor to my small kitchen.  I got the graphite and I like it very much.  It matches my black appliances very well.  Installation was easy, although one of my support bracket was bent.  After a little work, it was okay.  It is a bit difficult to screw the mount to the wall, if you are using a cordless drill/driver, due to the brackets being in the way a little, but it's nothing real serious.  The main rear mounting bracket is designed to be mounted on studs (16"" centers) and the holes line up fine. There is one other mounting hole at the top which will not be lined up with a stud, but is crucial. The top mount will hold a lot of the weight and will need to be fastened with an anchor or equivalent.  All in all, this unit looks nice and will help you out a lot, freeing up space somewhere else.  I have found similar products that are a lot higher priced and seem to be the same.  I highly recommend this rack!",0

5440,"A Honey of a Kettle. I think I read about all of the reviews before buying this dutch oven (Cherry Red).  I put it in my shopping cart, then procrastinated - checked back, and the price had increased by about $30.One valuable tip in the reviews was about the non-glazed inner rim of the lid.  It could become rusty, so I try to clean the kettle as soon as possible and put the four little rubber tabs back on the outer rim to hold the lid up off of the kettle when not in use.  It was also a nice idea to keep it on the stove where it adds a cheerful color to the kitchen.I've had the dutch oven for about 4 months now, and I simply love it.  It was a worthwhile investment.  So far I've just been using it for making soups, soup stock, roasts and one-dish meals - but I'll be launching out with more experiments.Thanks to a lot of the reviewers for their excellent tips and also warnings about what not to do.  Here's to good health!!!!",0
5441,"Stoneware Casserole. This is a high-fired stoneware casserole. Its non-porous enamel is same as on iron cast pots by Le Creuset and it looks great.

Though it's excellent for baking and can be brought to the table for serving as well, I give it only four stars because it's not unique in its baking qualities and I can get same results in Corning casserole for a fraction of a price.  As for cast iron Dutch ovens, I didn't find substitutes so far",0
5442,"Superb. I have probably had twenty espresso cups in my days. I like espresso cups that are sturdy with a good grip and a small saucer.Those doesn't fall in that category, but I love them anyway.I don't have to pre-heat them and it is beautiful to see all the crema through the glass.They hold the espresso warmer than normal cups.The cups are very light weight so they feel a little fragile. I wouldn't wash them in a washing machine I think",0
5443,"So useful!. This bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up.  I use mine constantly, and didn't think I would when I bought it.  We reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters I own.  I love my Fiestaware, you can't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes",0
5444,Kettle is the Bomb!. This Kettle works perfect. It is much faster than stovetop and all features work as advertised. What else is there to be said! 5 STARS,0

5447,"Love these plates!!!. I searched for a long time for plates to replace our every day china (after 12 years we were down a bunch of pieces, and I didn't want to pay for the replacements).  I ordered 4 sets, loving the shape and antiquing in the photos. They got here in 3 days, not a single chip or break, the color is better (more creamy) than it looks in the picture, and I love the weight and feel of it.  There are a few minor imperfections (a very small bubble here or there), but nothing that will harm the plate or user, and I love that they are all slightly different. I ordered one set to keep aside to replace breakage (3 kids)... but I love them so much I may order another so I get a good decade out of them",0

5450,good support. This neck pillow offers considerable support under the neck---bought it to replace an old one that had become thread-bare...husband uses it all the time.,0
5451,Great item. Had this for over a year with two small boys.  The fruit bowl keeps this from toppling even when my two are climbing up on the counter to get bananas.  My children ask for fruit more because I keep it out on the counter and they love getting taking the monkey's bananas.The glass bowl is well protected by the rubber stoppers inside and the metal frame.  Mine does not have so much as a chip even with two toddlers being able to reach it on the counter.Expensive but durable,0
5452,"Love this litterbox. I have used many automatic litter boxes, but this is the best one.  The cartridges are easy to change.  I just have to order online to get the cartridges since they are usually out of them at the stores.Thank",0
5453,Great fan for a great price. We got this fan for our young daughter's bedroom and it works so well in there.  I really like how quiet it is and that it is sealed up well so small fingers won't get injured.  I have found the thermostat to be very useful.  I can leave it on all night and it goes off at the temp I have it set for so my daughter does not get cold.  We are now getting 2 more--one for the nursery and one for the kitchen.  I would recommend it for small spaces because as the other reviewers say it is not extremely powerful.  But overall a great fan for a great price,0
5454,"Nora Pruiett. This crystal is a great bargin for the money - I choose super saver shipping.  I've looked and can't top the quality/quantity for the price. So far I've purchased the set of water glasses and the goblets.  This set is great and worry free when serving a large dinner that usually includes children.  If you like a heavy weight crystal this is it.  Save your ""good stuff"" for the quiet intimate times. Also, this crystal shows up the china quite nicely.",0
5455,"Rustic Baking Dish. This 1 1/2-Quart Round Casserole with Lid is a small but practical-sized dish to add to a Le Creuset collection. I'm a longtime collector of Le Creuset pots and pans, and 'flame' is my favorite color for them. I love the new Poterie stoneware line: baking dishes, ramekins, pitcher, and the crock for utensils. The colors are great, and they match the pots and pans perfectly. I use this red casserole dish when serving family-style at the table, and it's perfect for storing frozen or refrigerated casseroles for quick reheating on busy weeknights. These Poterie dishes coordinate especially well with Fiestaware dishes and serveware, and they make colorful additions to festive buffets. They are freezer-safe, microwave-safe, ovenproof up to 500 degrees F., and can go in the dishwasher",0
5456,"Useful little bowls. I have several of these bowls and use them frequently.  They are the perfect size for snacks.  I also use them frequently for food prep tasks when I'm cooking - they're a good size to hold a half-cup to one cup of a dry ingredient.  And of course, they are the perfect size for their intended purpose - fruit.  I find myself putting fruit on the table more often now that I have these bowls.  A cereal sized bowl seems like a lot of dish for one serving of fruit.  This smaller size prevents clutter on the table - especially if you are serving salad and bread on individual dishes.",0

5459,"Must have!!. I absolutely LOVE this cutting board! It makes cutting a lot easier. It is big enough to cut many differnt things and keep them all on the board. The board is very sturdy and heavy, but clean up was not bad at all. I had no problem handling it. It is not for someone with a small sink and not a lot of kitchen space. I also ordered the mystery (mineral) oil to preserve it. I know that this board will be around for a long time",0

5461,"Great Little Pan. One of the previous customers said this pan did not have the quality of the other Calphalon Commercial Nonstick cookware.  As far as this user is concerned, it absolutely does.  It is the same qualtiy as other Calphalon Commercial Nonstick cookware.  Yes, it is slightly lighter than the larger pans.  This is called proportionality. I have used Calphalon Commercial Nonstick for several years and am totally satisfied with this product line.  As for this particular 3/4 Qt. mini, it is a pleasure to use and clean-up is a snap.  I use it for sauces, and especially those oil and butter based ones for seafood.  Bottom line is that this is a neat little pan in the tradition of Calphalon's Commercial Nonstick cookware",0

5466,"Finally. I've tried several different types of pillows, including a water pillow, but this is the first to give me a good night's sleep. I tend to sleep on my stomach and this pillow seems very good for all sleeping positions. Total support witout being too high. It offers support even when I have my head on the edge of the pillow. With water pillows and others the support just flows away from the edge and I'm left flat. Love this pillow...Mmmmm",0
5467,"Fabulous cat toy. This Turbo scratcher is appealing to cats, even if they reject most scratching posts.  The ping pong ball adds an element of excitement.  I have 5 cats, and they all like to play with this toy",0

5471,"T Fal is wonderful. I have a set of T Fal pans which are 6 years old.  This new pan is even better, and you can't beat the prices for T Fal and the quality.  I have always washed my pans by hand, and the T Fal pans are a sinch to wash by hand.  It keeps them in great condition, and 6 years later, still non stick",0
5472,"Beautiful Shape, Easy to Use. I have about 10 different pans, and this is by far my favorite for a few reasons:1) Kids love the shape (Is it a crown? Is it a forest?)2) The shape makes it very easy to cut uniform size pieces.3) The pan releases very easily.Recommended!",0
5473,"A couple of drawbacks. I recieved my BBQ pit right before Christmas, and overall I love it. I can put chicken, ribs, pork loin.whatever in around lunch time, and it's delicious by supper. But it is LARGE so it takes up quite a bit of room,that also makes it harder to clean. The thing  I really don't like is the lid. It just slides into grooves, so it frequently moves when I am opening the lid. (when it's hot and heavy it's a pain) But it is convenient and my food tastes great.",0
5474,"Why are people so stupid. It's a wonderful cutting board (also available at the store) I'm a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something I've found very useful. Any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic. This one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks.The $9.99 price tag isn't bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well. That, and it just looks great in the kitchen. I use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and wouldn't go without them.Don't listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a 14 X 17 solid granite cutting board for ten bucks, not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives.FYI to the moron - &amp;amp;quot;Protect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight, tough, polyethylene cutting boards.&amp;amp;quot; Yah, nothing at all... dimwit",0
5475,"Decent vac, but mine was used. OK...in all honesty, I purchased this item simply because it, combined with a full-size vaccum that I was already purchasing, qualified me for a promotional gift certficate greater than its $14.99 price.  However, it comes in handy for tasks such as cleaning out the car - my old Dustbuster doesn't hold its charge long enough to finsh anymore.Upon attempting use one of the included attachments with the device for the firstt time, my wife was unable to insert it in the unit.  Upon inspecting it, I discovered a good chunk of what appeared to be a similar attachment already jammed down inside the vac.  I was able to crack it with a screwdriver, and remove the pieces with a needlenose pliers.  It was the tail end of one of the attachments, and had been obviously snapped off.This did, however, make me wonder exactly who was misrepresenting the vac - is Amazon knowingly selling used equipment as new, or is it their vendor?Used status aside, this performed as well as could be expected for a $15 device.  It sucks, and in vaccum-ery, that's a good thing.",0
5476,"I Love it!. It looks expensive, beautiful and heavy. Right size, right depth for my needs. I was a little concerned before I got it b/c I was afraid to get a broken one. But both pieces are fine. Highly recommended",0

5478,"Any bad reviewers are insane... Unless you received a defective unit, there is NO way anyone could give this any rating short of 5 stars. Ive owned dozens of booklights by several manufacturers and NOTHING compares to this product. Ive had mine for over 2 years and its still going perfectly.It's also sick that even though I read with it an average of an hour a night, Ive only had to replace the batteries 3 times. My spouse sleeps peacefully while I use this booklight, was not the case with other booklights that shine on page.Don't be deterred by reviewers that say it isn't bright enough. If this light isn't bright enough for your eyes, then you have no business reading in the dark.The only downside I can come up with is that the clear area is somewhat easy to scratch. My unit has many hairline scratches that you can see during the day, but are practically invisible when at use at night.Buy it, you won't be dissappointed",0
5479,"Great little fan. I first I was surprises to see that the blades were made out of cloth, but when I turned it on it worked great and it is absolutely quiet. Also, the cloth blades make it less dangerous if you hit the fan with your hand.  The only small negative is that it could be a little stronger at peak power setting",0

5488,Love this espresso machine!. I use this machine every day.  Even when my wife makes regular coffee I will quickly brew up a shot of espresso to kick it up a bit.  I use Peet's Italian espresso roast already ground for espresso machines and keep it in a vacuum sealed container.  It is a snap to fill the holder with grounds and pop it in the machine.  Within a couple of minutes I have delicsious espresso with a nice crema on top.  The milk steamer works far better than my old machine and makes terrific frothy steamed milk.  This is the best espresso maker I have found to date,0
5489,"These are really great bags!. Everything about our Miele (Red Velvet) vacuumn cleaner is top notch, including the bags. The nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag. This prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner.This is just a small detail, but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company's products",0
5490,Proctor-Silex can opener. We are completely satisfied with this product. Good value and a quality product that performs as advertised,0
5491,"Good heater, awkward design. I bought this heater for a spare bedroom. The quiet, and ability to set the thermostat to an exact temperature was a big selling point for me. This unit does a good job of taking the chill out of the air. However, don't expect it to quickly blow out volumes of hot air and heat an entire room within two-minutes.  I like the fact that it is completely quiet, and doesn't off-gas any strange smells (like the Delonghi Mica Panel Radiator). However, since it is a baseboard design, you have to get down on the floor with a flashlight to see and adjust the display, which has no light. A remote control would be a good improvement. Although this unit is very lightweight and has a low, long profile, it is still fairly large and doesn't exactly disappear, if you get my drift. Overall, I am pleased with the job it does",0
5492,"improving port. I was a skeptic, but so many wine lovers and respected critics said Riedel glasses did wonders for the tasting experience that I, a port lover, decided to try these.

I cannot speak to the issues other reviewers have raised as to the relative quality of the manufacture, but the taste was a marvel",0

Period.Maybe it's not as easy to sharpen as a Wustof or a Henckel, but then again, it holds its edge ten times longer.I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again",0

5497,"Wonderful toaster!. I bought this toaster because I loved the color and the retro look. I bought it at a Williams-Sonoma outlet as a refurbished piece for a 1/3 of the price of retail. I have never had a problem with the toaster since I bought it over a year ago. It makes the perfect toast. What's also nice about it, is it keeps the toast hot and toasty once the slice is done toasting, because it doesn't ""pop"" the toast out of the toaster. So, if you make toast and forgot about it for a few seconds, the toast will stay nice and toasty till you are ready to eat it.",0

5510,"Nice and big. Years ago I bought a potato cutter at a garage sale. It was all steel and a good size (accepting virtually any potato without cutting it down to size). I've been very happy with it.Recently we bought a cabin so needed to add a second set of kitchen tools. One of the items we decided we wanted was a second potato cutter. I ordered this one because of the ""jumbo"" in the name hoping that it would work as well as our previous garage sale cutter.Thankfully, this product lives up to the jumbo name. It's larger than our garage sale cutter by 20% or so. It is easy to use and clean up. Not to mention it has a suction cup to attach it to the counter which works surprisingly well.Pros: Large with two sizes of cutting blades; a larger mesh for traditional fries and smaller mesh for McDonald-like fries.Cons: It's plastic and steel which makes me wonder about longevity.All-in-all, I think this was a good purchase.UpdateMy wife loves this vegetable cutter and has asked me to order another! She has used ours at least twice a week since we recieved it in Aug 2005 and has had no difficulties with it at all. I'm surprised to see that another purchaser has had problems with this product. Perhaps they received a defective one? At any rate, I would still recommend the product.",0
5511,"Great product!. I received this as a gift 3 years ago. Since then, I have canned just about everything you can imagine in it. The only complaint I have is that the outside spots up and the inside stains, but I guess it's from all the use. I would definitely buy another one of these, but I think mine will last for years",0
5512,"Everything I was looking for!!. Ok let me start by saying I am not a coffee snob, I am more of a coffee nut, I very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers I wont turn up my nose.  And for a guy like me this machine is perfect!!  I looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something I see myself using 4-5 days out of the week so I setteled on this machine and I have not one regret.I have had the machine about 3 weeks now, I admit I dont use it every day as I have thoses mornings where I am just running late and dont have time, but in that three weeks I have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great.  This thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods I was just amased, my old machine went down quite a while ago so I havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine I was sipping a great one in minutes!The one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods, I bought the machine thinking I would use them as they seemed so convient...and dont get me wrong, the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso I have ever had, very quickly, but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and I have found it better to just pack my own double shots.  But besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me, it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for, be it a straight shot, a cappucino, or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you, may not be good enough for a coffee snob...but just right for a coffee nut!Oh and one hint I found very helpfull...turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it (the longer the better) with your cups up on the warmer.  I saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out, I exprenced the same problem when I dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup, but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso!",0
5513,"Works great on pet hair. I needed a hand-held vac for my travel trailer, particularly since we decided to take the German Shepherd with us on vacation this year.  The ability to pick up pet hair was a must.  I read on a lot of reviews and narrowed it down to the Dirt Devil 0100 and a cordless Shark (forget the model now).I bought the Dirt Devil in a local store because I didn't want the hassle of returning it in case I didn't like it.  But I LOVE IT!  I haven't used it in the travel trailer yet, but I've been using it weekly to vacuum the pet hair from the dog's bed, the cat's bed, and the chair the dog uses.  It works so well, I was amazed at how powerful it really is.  It works even better at picking up pet hair than my upright does using the attachments.Pluses include a nice long cord and a powerful motor with the brush.The minuses are it's a bit noisy (scares the cat!) and kind of heavy.  Someone with an arthitic hand might have problems using this vac.  Also, it seems to get pretty warm, but I only use it for a few minutes at a time so it's not been a problem.  I wish it came with a bag for the attachments.I recommend cleaning the dust cup every time you use it.  Mine fills up fast.  I don't use the little trap door but instead twist off the cap and empty it that way.  Also, I highly recommend cleaning the filter after EVERY use.  It really becomes clogged with dust even after only one use.  I take it outside and tap it against something to knock out the dust.  After about 4 uses now, I'm going to vacuum it with the attachments from my upright.  I think cleaning the filter after every use will help prolong the life the filter and even the vacuum itself.I highly recommend this vacuum for anyone with quick jobs or with the need to vacuum up pet hair.  I'm glad I decided on this model instead of the cordless Shark; now I don't ever have to worry if it's charged",0

It worked well but then I put him on Joint MAX DS when one of my friends told me about it.  I've been using Joint MAX for a year now and it's really made a big difference. Terrence's mobility has improved a lot more than when he was on Cosequin. Plus Joint Max is less expensive",0
5518,"meets our expectations. We had heard good things from other people who have purchased Le Creuset products and it is easy to see why.

5519,"Perfect for my needs... When purchasing the Sharp Warm & Toasty I knew not to expect great cooking power either as a toaster oven or microwave.  I'm a single guy living in a small apartment and this product does about what I expected and meets my needs.  Granted, the microwave wattage isn't all powerful at 650W and the toaster oven section tops out at 400 degrees, but again, it is OK for me.  I use the microwave for reheating or light cooking and the toaster oven gives me the crisping and toasting power a microwave can't.  I have to say that I rarely use all the myriad of buttons.  I think it is more complicated than necessary really.  I generally just hit plain old ""microwave"" or ""bake"" and select my time.  If you are looking for a space-saver and are not expecting to create big meals then it is a nice product.  My one complaint, though many love it, is the ""brushed aluminum look"".  To me it is a fad like the avocado and brown refrigerators of the 70's.  Plus, it is a pain to keep clean looking",0

5522,"Great for cleaning up in between vacuumings. I bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet, which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz.  It does a reasonable job cleaning, transforming my carpet from ""Does she ever vacuum?"" to ""Oh, she must have vacuumed yesterday"".  It doesn't get all the fuzz and crumbs, but it does what I'd expect from a sweeper.  It is also much lighter than my vacuum, so I'm much more likely to use it.My three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too.  She insists on sweeping her own room (I won't complain).The main thing I've learned is that, because the handle slides together, it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head.  This means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle, the sweeper will probably fall off, so pick it up near the sweeper.  (It stays together fine when actually sweeping.",0
5523,"Almost a home run. Wedgey certainly is cute. However, keep in mind to only use this on eggs or other very soft food items. It is a little hard to line the wires up appropriately. For the price, this is a good piece of equipment and a whimsical addition to any kitchen.",0

5529,"Solid Hardwood makes this a good buy. I have bought 2 of these bookcases.  They are very well made, set up in 2 minutes.  Forget the pressed wood bookcases -- I have.  They sag and fall apart.  Not these bookcases.  They are solid wood, the real thing, and best of all, there is no assembly required, just unfold where you want it, and start filling it up! Also, very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again.  Excellent buy for the price.  Not made in China, I think it is made in Vietnam",0

I read about the problems people had with the other similar lamp and the problem one person had with this one, but purchased it anyway as it truly fit my need. My conclusion: It's PERFECT! The base and pole are heavy with excellent connections with each having about an inch long of threading. Very sturdy lamp that gives off great light. Three settings let you light a set of 2 bulbs or the other set of 3 or all 5 of the bulbs. Great Lamp",0
5532,"Easy to Use &amp; Festive Too!. I was given this dish (by request) for my birthday and it has barely gotten a rest since! It works wonderfully for pies and tarts, but even better for baked appetizer dishes or nachos. The dish washes well in the dishwasher and stacks nicely in the cabinets. I wish it had little handles on the edges for better gripping when it comes out of the oven (it has a rim that is good to hold onto, but for clumsy chefs, something more might be better). Other than that, I love this dish and keep finding more and more uses for it",0

I hated driving driving without my husband in my car so he could hold her. Her crate doesn't fit in my car, so I looked for another option. This seatbelt is perfect for her! It's so easy to use and she can still stick her head and front paws out of the window and be completely secure. Now I'm not worried about her jumping out. She can comfortably lie down too. I think this is a better option than the booster seat because this pulls the dog back by the chest, not the neck. Plus, you don't attach the leash so there is no risk of strangulation",0

I have a FD-50 from about 15 years ago with 12 trays that I have used many times a year.  I've always wanted the 30 tray professional model but couldn't justify it because my old one still worked fine.  Well, I was ordering a jerky gun for a Christmas present so that became all the justification I needed.   I have 24 trays for mine at the moment and I was able to do my whole allotment of beef jerky at one time where it would have taken 3 different batches with my old one.  All I do is beef jerky and it usually takes me about 6 hours per batch with my FD-50 and it took the same amount of time with the Gardenmaster but with 24 full trays!  You can't beat this!   Everyone always wants me to make jerky and it is very time consuming but this certainly makes the end result get here faster.  Do yourself a favor, buy one....",0
5548,"Great value. This is the first dehumidifier I have owned, so I really can't compare it to others.  We bought it to take away some of the damp smells that seemed to come from our finished basement.  This thing seems to have done the trick.  Run continuously, it wrings out the moisture quite well, making a noticeable improvement after only a couple of hours.  Run on the range settings, you can specify it to come on only when the humidity reaches a certain point, allowing you to save power. We haven't noticed much of an impact on our electricity bill.  The only drawback is the thing is a bit loud, but not any worse than a window-unit style air conditioner",0

The cups that ""6 cups"" refers to are espresso cups or shots not full 8 oz. cups so if you drink a lot of espresso or want this to simply brew strong coffee (or teecino, a coffee alternative I often use) you'll want to be aware of the true amount of the what is brewed.

I read a lot of reviews and checked out my top three choices at the local gourmet kitchen store before deciding on the Caphalon set. The finish on the Calphalon set at the store wasn't quite as nice as the higher priced Wusthof and Henckels, but I just couldn't justify the additional cost given the limited amount of time I spend in the kitchen.The handles are comfortable to hold and use and the blades were all very sharp straight out of the box. Haven't had do any sharpening yet.  The labels on the butt of the handles ensure you get the right knife everytime. The block is well made with a nice finish including the Calphalon label.Despite my lecture regarding care of the new knives, my wife has managed to run at least two of them through the dishwasher so far.  This has made no noticeable change to the appearance of either knife.In summary, I'd say I'm quite happy with the Calphalon knife set.

Never wash the Moka with detergents, just rinse it under tap water4. You've gotta use it often for a good coffee.5. If you haven't use it in a while, make a weak coffee (""lungo"") and discard6. DO NOT put the MOka in the dishwasher.7. Use drinking water. Avoid tap water especially if very chlorinated8. Never compress the coffee.9. For a strong coffee fill the filter with ground coffee and make a small cupola that slightly protrudes beyond the rim. Do not press down.10. For best coffee, heat at very low heat.  It's ok if it takes 10min.11. As soon as coffee reaches the top, remove from heat12. Do not let the coffee boil13.

5589,"Good, but could be better. I got this pan because I've been coveting All-Clad when reading reviews of high-end cookware, and because of the low price.  I figured that the low price made it a teaser--something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line.  It's a nice pan, but limited.  On the good side, it's hefty, has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove, heats evenly and holds the heat. It is not non-stick, so I use it when I want the contents to produce the fabled &quot;brown bits&quot; that come up with deglazing.  Stuff sticks, unless you use a lot of fat. As noted by other reviewers, it does not have a pouring spout.  The rim is squared off, so the pouring stream tends to be very wide.  My other major gripe is that it does not have a lid.  All-Clad lids are pricey, like everything else in their line.  I sometimes use a cheap tempered-glass lid with it.    I still covet All-Clad pans, but not as much as I did before",0
5590,"Handier than a collander. No longer dreading making pasta. Spaghetti fits in the pot without breaking, and the water can be drained out after cooking right into the main pot. Great! However, do not overfill the water in the pot or it can boil over, coming out the sides between the pot and the insert",0
5591,"I Love my Sunbeam Toaster. I had a Sunbeam toaster for many years and it finally stopped working properly. I went shopping and could not find a Sunbeam anywhere so I bought another brand and did not like it, took it back and got a different brand which I also did not like. I kept it for about 2 months and got on line determined to find a Sunbeam, which I did and as I said...I Love my Sunbeam Toaster! It met all my expectations of Sunbeams products and I will stick with it from now on. Thank you",0

5593,"Aerobie AeroPress Coffee Maker. A good way to make a cup of coffee.  Particularly good if you want a fresh brewed taste, but don't need to brew a full pot for only one or two people.

5594,"You need this vacuum!. WOW!  Our old vacuum finally bit the dust and it was time to buy a new one.  Concerned about quality and function, my wife and I looked at all the ""big price"" vacuums on the market yet we were hesitant to pay a small fortune for a vacuum.  Cleanliness is a high priority in our household, especially with a one year old son who puts everything in his mouth!  I read a ton of reviews and finally decided to take a chance on this vacuum and I am so glad I did!We thought our house was clean, but after using this vacuum just one time in one room, we were frightened at just how dirty our floors were based on how much this vacuum picked up from our floor.  This thing has great power, a nice wide head, and is so easy to use that my five year old wants to help vacuum.  We love it so much we are buying another one for our clothing store.The vacuum is a bit loud and heavy.  However, if you are vacuuming the noise shouldnt matter all that much.  The weight actually enables us to move it around furniture easier than a lightwieght because it tracks better.  Don't spend $500 for a vacuum.  We bought this for less than $100 with free shipping and we couldnt be happier.  If you need a vacuum and have a family or pets, this is the vacuum you need, you wont be disappointed",0
5595,"Victory. I turned the device onto human sound because on sub-sonic, I didn't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning.  The device itself on human sound was triggered by many things, air condtioner, mower, air plane, thunder, etc. which was not good in that I doubt it would serve as an effective training device. The dogs seemed to trigger it at random times.  We have large lots here in this area of NJ and I placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem.  HOWEVER, my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole I placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs' outside times. She advised me that her book clubs (inside) and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly.  The capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation. I would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone",0
5596,"Great value. When you consider the great convenience of the Cuisinart TTG-500RM Mug to Go Coffeemaker--and the low price that Amazon is asking--this deal is too good to pass up. Enjoy a hot, tasty brew and save cash while you're at it",0

5600,"Very pleased with table. Love It! Great addition to my home:]. I just received my table and do have to say that I am empressed. To tell you the truth, after reading the other reviews, I was quite skeptical about purchasing this table. Like the hard headed person that I am, I went ahead and purchased it anyways. I didn't know what to expect when it first arrived. I read about how some people received only the table top or others received only the base. I was extremely happy to see the delivery man carrying both packages. Some people also mentioned that once they opened the boxes, pieces of the table were damaged/broken. After throughly inspecting all pieces, the only damage that I was lucky to receive is a slight, tiny scratch on the table top [which I can fix]. I am very satisfied with my table. I wish the best of luck to the next person that purchases it. I hope my review was helpful. :",0

5602,"Works very well, I'll have to buy Lodge in the future. Nothing bad to say at all about this pan except for losing a few points in the beginning.  I seasoned this in the oven about three times before use, and the pan gets better every time.  It works very well on my gas grill, so I can cook breakfast outside which is fantastic",0
5603,"Overall, a great machine!. Good points:1) Heats up to the right temperature relatively quickly.2) Makes a great, strong cup of espresso with great crema (I have been using the Lavazza Gran Crema E.S.E. pods, never tried with ground espresso, because I am trying to avoid a mess).3) Mine takes about 20 seconds to go from ""espresso"" temperature to the hotter ""frothing"" temperature, as opposed to the one or two minutes other machines take4) It really does froth a nice thick froth, nothing runny and flimsy like every other cappucino maker I have ever had!5) You can pretty much brew one shot after another, with a few short seconds in betweeen to allow boiler to heat up the water to the right temp.  The consistency of brewing temperature is really very satisfactory and stable.6) You can make hot chocolates and tea with the frother and hot water coming from the frother, respectively.  Nice for a couple drinks at a time and a lot quicker than boiling a kettle for tea.7) Obviously, it is a beautiful piece and you will definitely notice it gets commented about.  Looks good in a modern kitchen but is also just as comfortable (in Stainless, pastel pink, cream or white) in a Shabby, retro, or country romantic kitchen.8) The clean up is a total breeze if you are using E.S.E. podsNot-so-good points:1) The water resevoir will need to be refilled if you make ""longer"" or ""taller"" drinks like lattes and ""americanos"", especially if you are making drinks for two or more in a household.  If you prefer straight espresso shots and those topped off with a nice scoop or two of frothed milk, you're in business and can go for three days or more without re-filling.  Otherwise, be prepared to refill daily.2) The ""cup warmer"" on top of the machine is not really hot enough to keep the cups warm unless you turn the machine on for a good 20 or 30 minutes before brewing with the cups on top.  But it is a cute place to store the cups and I never really had problem drinking espresso from a room temp. cup anyway, have you?  Just a small thing I noticed, really but something I thought could be pointed out.Just to note:  I bought mine off Ebay from the outlet refurbished and have had no problems.  It came with a 6 mos. warranty, and I saved hundreds.  If you cannot come up with 800 bucks for one, this is the way to go.  Happy brewing and lattes of love",0
5604,"Super Sofa. We ordered this sofa and matching ottoman on Target.com with a discount we recieved via email.  It has far exceeded our expectations!I read all the reviews and they are dead on.  The upholstery IS darker.  The cushions are firm and comfortable. It's very nice.  The frame is solid and the fabric luxurious.The only problem we had is with the freight conractor that Target used being slow to communicate. But, it did arrive in one piece and was easy to put together (having 2 people helped).If you are thinking about this couch....go ahead! You won't be sorry.It's high quality and affordable! This is very durable and looks like it costs twice as much.  I would buy it all over again! We love it",0
5605,"So nice to have sharp knives again. I had been using my Victorinox steak knives for all my cutting needs because I can't be bothered to get out my huge cooking knives and have to clean them afterward (yes, I am that lazy). I finally decided to get some knives for paring, etc. that I can throw in the dishwasher. The first time I used the paring knife in this set I actually cut my thumb because they are so much sharper than what I had been using (yes, I have that horrible habit of cutting towards my thumb and not away). Anyway, I was pretty impressed. This is a good brand, and this is a nice little set",0

5609,"Matches perfectly with Fiestaware!. I bought the plates, bowls, cups, etc. to go with my fiestaware because I like to mix and match my patterns to create a colorful, festive table to suit my mood for myself or entaining dinner guests.  The colors are actually more vivid and brighter than the pictures show on Amazon and the merchant's website.  I have tangerine, sunflower, cinnabar, persimmon, scarlet and shamrock in the fiesta. This set would also go well with the periwinkle and plum colors as well. Hopefully, they can find a way to create a more accurate picture of the colors. I have had the Santa Fe set for a few weeks now and using them in microwave and dishwasher is no problem. That said, if you like to mix n' match colors with Fiestaware or want a nice sturdy dinnerware set with lots of color, than this santa fe style is it",0

I have owned the Granos for about 6 months and have found it to be a pleasure.  It is easy to use and makes a top quality cup of expresso.  The style of the unit is also unique and has generated much conversation with house guests.  If you want a reliable expresso machine that makes a great straight shot or latte, I can't recommend the Granos more highly. I plan to buy another for my office",0
5611,"I did it -- I made great BEER!. What can I say -- it works!  The trickiest part is assembling the unit so as to contain pressure.  I had to assemble it twice to get it right, but the patience paid off.  Once you are past that hurdle, the rest is simple.  My beer feremnted quickly and clarified nicely.  The directions are straightforward.  The beer tasted real good, like a true microbrew.  Very clean and light with a distinct hoppy aftertaste.  And the stock formula had quite an alcohol kick!  Wow.The unit suggests bleach cleaning but everyone else on the web says ""beware"".  I picked up some formulas and one step cleaners from Mr. Beer that should work fine in the Beer Machine",0

I own MANY pieces of Le Creuset; they are indeed heirloom quality and perfect for cooking anything that needs to cook at a steady, low heat.  They are fabulous in the oven, too.

5625,"Doors only partially solid oak and missing instructions!. This Item came well packaged, but was missing the assembly instructions.  A quick call to the Seller resulted in an e-mailed PDF copy being sent.  I searched the internet for instruction and most stores stated that you needed to e-mail or call for a copy.  I think the manufacturer should swallow the cost and print the 4 pages of instructions and include them.  The Assembly was very easy and was not missing any hardware.  The overall quality is decent.  The Product details are a little foggy.  Everything on the unit is MDF except the very front of the doors which is a nice oak.  The product description stated the entire door is solid oak, not the case as the sides, top and bottom as well as shelves in the doors are all MDF.  The back of the unit is rigid cardboard.  Overall, I am pretty happy with the construction.  I did have to redrill one of the holes because when assembled, the non locking door (left side) has a latch on the inside that did not match up with the predrilled hole.  I would recommend this cabinet based on its storage capacity, relatively low price and ease of assembly, just don't expect anything that will last several moves and a lifetime of use.",0
5626,"Simple, attractive, works very well. Unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome; distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time.  With normal bread in before lowering, the bread sticks almost 1/2 way out of the toaster, making it very easy to remove hot toast, to toast smaller items (the plunger will go up even further to assist);  the slots are extra wide so, although I have not used the sandwich cage accessory, I can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage (apparently a British idea, and  maybe something worth investigating).  I am doing normal toast on only setting 2, bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect! (bagel feature: push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right).  The machine feels solid as if it will last a long time.  The Cobalt Blue color is more of a bluish-purple in normal light, but very attractive.Very happy with the machine (the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping!",0

It is fast approaching my favorite time of year and I am gearing up for tons of baking ( I give away baked goodies to our neighbors during the holiday season--which in my mind starts in October!!) I love the weight of this one--just throw it in the fridge for about 20 minutes ( I did it while I was making the dough) and it works great--I was making molasses cookies and the dough didn't stick at all!

This knife is amazing and it held up nicely despite the fact that I sharpened it weekly for several months and I used it to cut up a lot of different cuts of meat.  It is very flexible and it works really well at trimming fat and removing meat from bone.  Another positive thing about the knife is the handle.  It is easy to clean, it doesn't absorb moisture when you wash it, and it is comfortable to hold.  I highly recommend this knife, and at this price you definitely will not be dissapointed.  I paid more for it and I love my boning knife",0

He loves the lid that keeps the water hot while the tea is steeping and it seems to fit in all sizes of our mugs.  His only complaint was because the bottom of the filter is flat and made of plastic, it is harder to clean.  If it was slanted or had a little bit of filter on the bottom, you could run water through the bottom to get some if the tea sludge out.  Instead you have to dig around with your finger, scrape it for a bit and rinse it a lot.  All in all though he loves it and I may be getting myself one too.",0

It is well situated for both slicing meats and cutting and dicing vegetables, as it is easy to hold the knife forward towards its blade for a quick and balanced wrist action. The only reason I gave this knife 4 stars and not five is due to the handle. While it is dimpled it can still get slippery when cutting fatty meat. I would prefer a synthetic handle covering, but otherwise this is a well designed tool -- perhaps the best chef's knife available now",0

5647,"Coffee lover. Greetings, I love this stove top espresso maker but there are some differences you may find of value.1)- The boiler where you put the water can only be filled about 25% compared to most at 70% which means a rather large unit in relation to the amount of espresso you can make.2)- Maintenance is more than others because this machine uses more pressure and there are more seals to replace when necessary. These are not readily available locally and you will probably have to have them shipped to you at an extra expense that may exceed your sense of reasonableness. Also..most of these types of machines come with extra seals. This unit doesn't come with any extra seals at all.3)- The picture looking through the window at the top of the machine seeing the nice crema is a farce. The only way to see the nice crema if you carefully follow the directions is to lift the lid up and wipe the condensation off of the inside that is always present that blocks your view.4)- Realize that this unit is made of Aluminum and some are concerned with the toxic effects of that if any gets into your Java that has high acidity content.Plusus include -1)- Very nice and tasty espresso superior to other stove top machines.(no aluminum taste)2)- Really nice crema but only if yor coffee is of a fine grind #1, or #2 and the coffee needs to be freshly ground. If you buy pre-ground coffee packages at the market you will not be seeing any crema. I buy fresh coffee ground by the half pound at #1, or #2 fine grind and get really good results.I hope this is helpful to you.Cheers",0
5648,"Some inexpensive entertainment. I love this little fish bowl. I have had no problems with the size or quality of the bowl. When I clean the bowl. I gently remove it from the base. Use both hands. Take it to the sink, do not pour the water out of the bowl. Leave the betta in the bowl, just be gentle and slow with your movements. I use a turkey baster and suck the yuck and food that has settled to the bottom of the bowl.  I clean the bowl every 7 to 14 days so there is not much junk in the bowl to suck out. Take your time and move your baster around the bottom and squirt it out in the sink with each fill of fish water. My Charley Brown doesn't mind at all having his home cleaned if you take it slow and gentle and don't disturb him. After about half the bowl of fish water has been removed take a paper towel and run it around the inside of the bowl and remove any residue that may have built up on the inside of the bowl. I use spring water that I pick up at walmart in the gallon jugs. VERY SLOWLY, pour and fill the bowl back up to the top, I leave about an inch of space at the top. The fish does better if you leave some of his old water in his bowl.  The fish gets stressed if only all fresh water is used to replace his water. Replace the bowl back in its base using both hands gently. I can't emphasize enough, show and gently, when doing this job. Your betta will love you for it. If you are having a lot of junk in your bowl, you are feeding too much. I only give 2 little pellets every other day.  Don't seem like much but its plenty. And the betta is fine without a heater for the bowl. Unless in the winter you sit him outside on the patio. Now that would not be good. Keep your baster only for your betta bowl. Don't want turkey in your betta bowl. My Charlie is thriving so I must be doing something right. If you don't have much space you will love this. Make the cat keep her paws to herself",0

5656,"elegant and sturdy. I must admit that I always thought that people who decanted their wines were just a little bit over the top.  A friend of mine told me that he could take a relatively cheap - or new - wine and make it taste better by pouring the wine into a decanter through a wine strainer.  By increasing the wine's exposure to oxygen it reduced the tannic taste some wines have when poured immediately from the bottle; proving the old ""let it breathe"" adage.  He won me over after we hammered down a couple of bottle of wine his way.   I purchased this along with the 1 liter version as a gift for another friend",0

5659,Great Quality and Size. My Mom asked for one of these to replace some $200 carafe she had broken that came from William Sonoma.  The one from William Sonoma seemed grossly overpriced to me so I bought this one based on reviews from others.  My Mom liked it even better than her old one!  I bought one for myself at the same time and enjoyed serving tea to guests in it.  It's not too big to be too heavy but it holds enough tea for 4-6 people.  Perfect,0
5660,TV Top Shelf. Item as described and very easy to assemble.Arrived in a timely manner.,0
5661,"Great table and chairs. I ordered the rectangular version of this table and chairs set even after reading the other reviews.  This was after my husband said that he could get it together no problem.  When the table and chairs arrived my husband was busy, so I tried putting everything together.  I had a hard time getting all the screws in and was close to stripping the heads as well.  My husband helped me out.  He backed out all the screws, applied soap to them as lubrication (i.e., from a bar of bath soap) and screwed them back in.  The table and chairs are as sturdy as can be and the quality of wood is wonderful (especially for the price...most sets I looked into were in the $300 to $500 range).  I would recommend this product",0

5666,"Exceptional Value and Quality. I have wanted a nice soft down comforter ever since we took a cruise and had such a nice one on our bed. Unfortunately, before this one, all of them were out of my price range. I was hesitant to order one this inexpensive, figuring the quality couldn't be that great. Boy, was I wrong. My husband looked at it on our bed and asked me twice, ""Are you sure that's what you paid for THIS?""It is soft, it is luxurious, it's just a fine quality comforter. I hope to get another one for our guest room before Amazon wises up and charges more for this. Wow! I'm very happy with this purchase",0
5667,Great Value for the money... This knife set is a good value for the money.  Need to keep the slicer and butchers knives sharp through proper maintenance but that is true of all good knives.Utility knife is wasted and I really wish the scissors came apart for easy cleaning as I use them to cut whole chickens often.  Otherwise Chef's knive and slicer feel very good in the hands.  Steak knives still sharp after 6 months of use.  And overall the quality of manufacture is excelent,0
5668,Excellent quick grill for the kids & adults. I purchased this so that my 14 year old wouldn't use the stove on his own. I wished I had bought one of these years ago for myself. It cooks evenly and the meats retains moisture. The only drawback is cleaning it - other than that it's a great product.,0

We had a smaller pad on the bed, but it would shift and move and never give us 100% coverage. This pad is perfect! Fits wonderfully and easy to toss in the wash. Would definitely recommend it",0
5671,Puppy Playpen. This is a really nice pen for puppies or older dogs. It is a great item to have when you do not want your furkid underfoot.

5674,"Melitta One, Mango. A very interesting coffeemaker indeed. Funky but conservative colors and a rocket-shaped design lets you know this product is unique. It is not small, however, just because it's a single serve maker does not make it small. It serves about 4-5 cups with one coffeepod and is instantly warmed up and ready to go. The only drawback is buying the pods specifically made for coffeemakers such as these and they can't be used for any other coffee maker",0

5676,"GREAT coffee roaster. We had one of the orginal Hearthware roasters and wore it out after 3 years of weekly roasting.  we looked at several other brands and went back to the newest hearthware,  and very glad we did.  the programed options are outstanding,  its easy to use and makes great coffee, very consistant roasts  a friend has another brand and can not get consistant results",0
5677,A god send. Great shape for the freezer or fridge.  Our food has kept so well that there is little wastage.  Good for marinator or just as a food saver canister.  The whole concept is such a 'friendly' product to the Earth - recycleable and reduces food waste.  I wish everyone would get at least one of the food saver products.,0
5678,"Nice 'Winter' Grill. This grill comes in handy in the middle of Michigan winter when we can't fire up our outdoor BBQ.  It cooks quickly and cleans fairly easily.  I have never dared to place it in the dishwasher, although it sounds like a lot of people have so I might try it.  There are a few downfalls - you do get grease splatters on the countertop no matter how careful you are and if you like your meat medium-well be prepared to crack a window open because the 'burnt' smell will linger for days otherwise",0
5679,High quality and user friendly. The Henckels 4 star knives are wonderful. I am able to get such a good grip on these. Very happy with the set. The only difference between this 4 star set and the 5 star set is the handles. I personally liked how my hand contoured to these handles. Previously owned the famous and expensive cutco knives. These are just as well balanced. Highly recommend,0
5680,"Great, affordable, German China. German made china that is fabulous. I paid $10.99 per plate a week ago, and now Amazon lists this same plate at $16.10! Of course, that is still way below retail, but not the great buy I got. However, you'll like the plate as it is beautiful and goes with any other dishes you may have. I bought 10 for use as buffet plates. Be aware that the plate is almost flat, the edge is only slightly raised. No design except on the wide edge which is smooth but with discreet dotted design the exact color of the plate itself. Easy to coordinate with about anything else you put on the table. Only 4 stars because of unreasonable price increase",0

But it fills my house with greasy smell. It was a lot more than just deep frying on the stove top. Also, it was a little too big for a family of four, considering the amount of unusable oil I had to throw down the drain. I will still use it for recipes which call for a deep fryer, with good ventilation",0

5689,"Better than original carafe. After the handle broke off the carafe that came with our Krups AromaControl (after about 2 years of use, perhaps several times a week), I found this one and ordered it.  My belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off, however I am perturbed that I had to go to the trouble of replacing it.One would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components.  I am not entirely sure, but it is possible that the plastic (ABS?) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured.  I searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem, which is at the same time comforting and annoying.Upon receiving this carafe, I was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it.  I prefer a certain heft, and I assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made.  However, this has proved not to be the case; moreover, the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing.  Further, I think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe (inside) on this model.  The advantage of this is that the coffee pours better (a tighter stream, not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe), however, I it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult.In all, it is superior to the original, however I am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off.  I assume that they have fixed this problem in this model, however I cannot be sure of this.  I also must say that it is a tad over-priced, and that perhaps [...] might be a more reasonable price.  The only reason I did not get a new coffee maker is that the AromaControl works well and makes good coffee (I use Illy)",0

5694,"Happy chopper! Review applies to both 5"" & 7"". I completely agree with Sobai's January 9th review. I looked at the Furi knives when shopping locally two months ago, but my husband encouraged me to purchase a set of Wusthof classic knives instead. While I love the Wusthofs, I reach for my Furis just as often.I received the Furi 5"" knife as a Christmas gift and was so pleased with the product that I ordered the 7"" a week later.  Both knives were incredibly sharp right out of the package. I give them a couple of swipes down a steel before each use and they're holding an edge beautifully.Like Sobai, I also like the orange silicone grip (did someone actually call it plastic?). I have small hands and find the grip to be ergonomic, safe and comfortable. The knife remains secure in my hand even when cutting chicken! The orange color stands out in my block, making it easy to find the desired knife quickly. Besides, nothing like a little ""Harley Davidson"" orange to brighten up the kitchen ;-)Knives are a matter of personal preference. I'm pretty picky and have found the Furis to be a quality product. My recommendation: go to a local knife shop and hold a lot of different knives in your hand. Pay attention to how each feels and imagine how your hand would feel after cutting a mountain of veggies. The ""best"" knife in the world for one person may not be the best choice for another.Happy chopping",0

5696,"Good Quality, but wouldn't recommend for top bunk. I bought this mattress pad for my 4-yr-old son, who sometimes had accidents in the bed at night.  The pad is of good quality: it adds coushin to the mattress and it has never leaked for us.  I also bought one for my older son's bed, which is the top bunk, and it's really difficult to put it on his mattress.  It's quite a workout, so I would not recommend it for loft beds or bunk beds",0

5698,"Great cups for the kids, guests, anyone!. I originally purchased these tumblers for our kids to use.  I wanted something that was unbreakable (for the kids), but also something that would withstand the dishwasher (our old ""kid"" cups cracked after two runs in the dishwasher...they were cheapies from Target).These tumblers are great.  The smaller size in the set is ideal for little hands, but my kids use the bigger ones as well.  They've been dropped several times without breaking/cracking.  HOWEVER, we did have one that was sitting full of water in the sink, and someone dropped a heavy butter knife into the cup.  This created a small crack on the inside of the tumbler; the crack does not go all the way through, so we still use the tumbler.Overall, these tumblers are great as an unbreakable option for kids.  We've had friends over for dinner and sometimes they actually prefer to drink out of these versus our regular glass tumblers.  With their modern design, they will work well out on the patio this summer as well!  My only word of caution is to not drop heavy silverware directly down into them (kind of a no-brainer there), otherwise they WILL crack.They look like glass from a distance, and have a very substantial feel to them as well.  We initially ordered one set, but after they arrived we ended up ordering another one!  They've withstood the dishwasher AND my kids.  I highly recommend these to everyone",0

They also come in small sizes for toy dogs if you don't want a big one",0
5705,"The Perfect Wok!. I highly recommend this wok.  It is super light but very strong.  It comes unseasoned, but it was easy to season as it was so light.    Once seasoned, it became a deep coppery color, and is slowly getting darker.It cooks beautifully, very quickly and the vegetables stay crisp and delicious.  Originally, I wanted a wok with a longer handle thinking this would make it easier to move.  Suprisingly the handles do not usually get very hot, and I haven't really had any trouble holding it when cooking or picking it up.Cleaning it easy, once seasoned nothing sticks, and even when I leave it unwashed overnight, it cleans quickly just using cold water and one of those plastic covered sponges.I definitely recommend getting the wok ring, this makes the wok far more stable. Otherwise this is the perfect wok, it is light, strong, cast iron and is a pleasure to cook with.",0

I don't always disagree, but we make press pot coffee twice a day and heating up the water on the stove took 15+ minutes and there was always floating sediment in the bottom of our kettle...sounds appetizing!  I researched this kettle and liked the description that the water boiled quickly and turned off automatically....I also wanted it to retain heat and be able to be taken off of the heating source for serving.  My husband (and I) really like this pot.  We use it not only for coffee (full pot to boiling takes just under 5 minutes) but to boil water for pasta and other cooking.  It saves me time and I don't want to be in the kitchen all night....this is one small appliance that we do not want to be without.  The only change I would make is that the handle seems a bit large for the average hand so it is not as comfortable to hold and I still have sediment...which is probably a problem with my water.  At least now I can get into the pot to clean through the large opening.  No weird smells here and we have been using daily for 6 months",0

Nevertheless, I never really considered buying an ice cream scoop or spade - afterall, a spoon was good enough for my parents, so why not for us.  However, tennis elbow set in and my spouse needed something that would allow him to dig into the hardest ice creams.  I needed something to round out an Amazon order so that I qualified for a $25 discount and voila - this ice cream spade was the answer to both our needs.  We love it - it's sturdy, well made and we're thrilled with this ""accidental"" purchase that turned out to be an absolute necessity",0

If you put this one on the lowest setting it's just right noise wise.The 2nd and 3rd settings we find way too loud.  It cleans the air well. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the light around the control is extremely bright. I had to paint around it to black it out and it still shines through some",0

The color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender, they call it Plumberry. The weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well, that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it. When the washcloths are completely drenched, they do seem a little more heavy than most, although they have that ""spa feel"" to them and they retain heat very well, which makes them sort of comforting. I've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent I've found. They are made with 100% combed cotton and have a heavier feel. The edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don't fall apart the first time you wash them.~The Rebecca Review",0
5717,"Best in show. I dont honestly know where I first found mine, but I fell in love with it immediately.  You never have to struggle with the cork.  My parents recently discovered a love for wine and as a gift I was going to get them one of these.  Well to my suprise, there is not a single shop in a 100 mile radius that carries this.  Everyone still uses the one step approach or worse yet, the auger approach.  Five stars all the way",0

Surprisingly, it has not fallen since. I made sure to follow the instructions and clean the surface and allow to dry before applying the suction. Although, it is not holding a heavy amount of items, just a few sponges and a 3oz dispenser of soap.Note: Don't mistaken this product to being the same one as ""OXO Good Grips 1056042 Utensil Holder, White"", also sold on amazon. When I looked closer to the product image+reviews, that doesn't have suctions. The compartments on that would have been great for this sink basket.",0

If you buy it I would recommend also purchasing some Bar Keeper's Friend (cleaner) and some copper polish. I've been able to keep my set looking great- I even requested and received a pot rack for Christmas just so I can display them. It really hasn't taken much time or effort to clean them and keep them nice. I usually use just soap and water and then the Bar Keeper's Friend every few washes. Nothing major. The copper needs to be polished every few washes, but it's really easy - just put the polish on a rag and wipe. Rinse and done.I can honestly say I don't have any complaints",0

5723,"Great little expresso pot!. This concerns the Bialetti Class 4 cup expresso pot.  After becoming addicted to the much too expensive Starbuck's caramel macchiato but living too far away to have one daily, I happily discovered this small expresso pot.  The Amazon reviews sounded encouraging so I ordered one.  It's amazing!  I use sugarfree vanilla syrup, nonfat milk (frothed with the Aerolatte milk frother, another wonderful product) and sugarfree caramel sauce and when combined with the expresso made with the small pot I have an even better tasting drink than Starbuck's in less than 3 minutes.  I like it so well that I've ordered the Bialetti Class 10 cup for when I have guests.  Both are made in Italy of heavy gauge stainless steel and are very handsome.  Incidentally, my husband bought a Bialetti Musa 6 cup for me but I had to return it.  It leaked around the seal when making the coffee.  It was made in India and although it looked very nice, the steel  was a lighter gauge or it was possibly made of aluminum, I don't remember for certain, and I didn't like the handle or lid opener button nearly as well as the Class version.",0
5724,"Good but a little mis-sized. I bought this two years ago. I probably use it once a month for baking. Even though it's non-stick, I had purchased a silicone baking mat since it allows the pan to last longer and cookies don't burn. Unfortunately, I discovered that this sheet is about a half inch too narrow (probably 11"" when I needed 11 5/8""). It would have been nice if the full dimensions had been listed on the product desciption.Otherwise, it's done pretty well. Nothing sticks and it cleans up well except for some condensation that seems to have left brown stains that I cannot wash away",0

5728,This is excellent for cappuccino lover!. This is very easy to use and to clean and I love this cappuccino more than starbucks. I also love this looks. It is so cute,0
5729,Perfect every time. The product is as sdvertized and is very simple to use. I am not a coffee connisseur but I do enjoy a good espresso. It has never been bitter or burned. I am very pleased with this product,0
5730,Beautiful table. I ordered this coffee table.  It arrived as scheduled.  It was average difficulty to assemble.  The quality is consistant with the money paid.  I love it.  Everyone who sees it asks where I got it because they have not seen anything like it.  I have had it for over a year and am extremely happy with it,0
5731,"Love it!!. This thing is great. I would give it 5 stars. But the 2 stoppers that come with it are the same size. It's great for most bottles of wine. But I found that if the cork is a little big, that the stoppers do not seal properly. I put a bottle of wine in my refrigerator (and I had to lay it on its side) and it leaked. Despite that....I love it.",0
5732,"Use it all the time. Very hady not only for deep frying in the wok, but for fishing raviloi and other pasta out of a large pot of boiling water instead of straining.  A must have tool in the kitchen and for the price, you really can't go wrong",0
5733,"Absolutely wonderful!!!. I love  this pan! We have a large family and I easily fit 5-6 chicken breasts in this pan at one time.You don't have to cook with high heat because this pan easily distributes the heat evenly. Low heat is also best so the food doesn't stick.Clean up is really easy!!! Warm, soapy water and that's it!This is definitely a quality made pan. I have several pieces from Le Creuset and know they will last me through my lifetime",0
5734,"A Newer Version. Our old Gizmo's battery gave up the ghost.  We liked the can opener because it was compact under the cabinets and worked well.  The only problem with the first version was that it was always plugged in a charging which shortened battery life.The new version must be removed from the holder to charge overnight.  This lets you fully discharge the battery before charging which extends battery life.  Much better.Oh, it does a very good job of opening cans",0
5735,Great product.. The Flexible Chopping mats are great for preparing/chopping and dicing fruits and veggies!Thank you,0
5736,"Super quick machine- Works great!. I am a pastry chef at a small restaurant and just spent countless hours over the holiday season making sorbets and gelatos in my home sized (1 pint) Lello  gelato maker, which I recommend, but this makes 1/2 gallon of in 15-30 minutes ( depending on the product desired).The upside - works well for both soft-serve/ frozen drinks and gelato/ice cream. It's easy to clean. It's made in the US, and it's fast.The downside. IT'S HUGE. I thought the UPS man was delivering a Toyota when it showed up.  It's loud...really really load, makes the washing machine sound like the toaster.All in all, I am very pleased. Amazon's price was great ( $200 less than Kitchenaide is selling them on Ebay) and the shipping was fast ( overnight) and free.",0

5738,"my favorite appliance. I have had my machine for several weeks and it rocks! There was a wee learning curve (my fault, not the machine's) but it is now turning out loaf after loaf of delicious fluffy bread. I've had absolutely no mechanical problems at all so far. As long as I follow the recipe instructions (who knew it was so important to use all room-temp ingredients so the bread would rise properly?!)I get a perfect loaf every time. My family of bread-loving men couldn't be happier and I really believe it is saving me money to make my own bread, plus it is so much more convenient than making the trek to the closest grocery store, which, given where I live (Middle of Nowhere), isn't very close",0
5739,"Solid Cleaner. This unit cleans floors very well, even short berber patterned carpet that has different levels.  It is easy to use with the separate soap dispenser.  Overall it works well.

5747,"Makes a huge difference, some features confusingly lacking. I got this to accompany my Gaggia 35005 Carezza, because had been having inconsistent results with blade grinders, and store bought pre-ground wasn't doing it for me. This thing makes a *huge* difference, it's incredible. For that particular espresso machine, I found that a grind setting of 9 works great.The problems are the doser doesn't actually neatly dose anything, sometimes I have to hit it 5 times, sometimes 3... puzzling. You can eye it, but the thing only appears to work if you grind a bunch of beans, and make more than one drink. First drink, it takes a few pulls to get the grounds to the front for the doser. Also, there's no neat way to only grind what you need to use, looks like some experimentation and another timer will be required.Another issue is it looks like you have to actually disassemble it, which is not a simple task, to clean it thoroughly... or really even at all.Overall, it's quiet, creates perfect grounds, has a *ton* of settings (although, I can only see myself using two, one for coffee, one for espresso), but the doser is garbage. I might have opted for a cheaper model, knowing this... but my lattes are perfect now",0
5748,Oscar Rocks!. I love my duvet cover. The fabric is of a very high quality and the print is attractive. It is also washable which is a bonus,0
5749,"Pleased with the Product. I love the capability that can be transferred from a microwave to an oven.  I use it primarily for my frozen crab cake that I microwave it first for couple minutes, then move it to an oven to finish cooking with crisp textures",0
5750,"Soft with a good fit. We are verry satisfied with our Pinzon sheets, we had pruchased other more expensive sheets in the past and these were just as good if not better than the fancy name brand.  The two things that were a deciding factor in my purchase were the free shipping and the depth of the pockets, when the sheets arrived I was more than happy as they fit our pillow top matrice quite well and were ever so soft, I was looking for deep pocket sheets and these didn't say that in the description so I was not sure how they would fit. I have since purchased several more sets from Pinzion, including many of their plad ones.  Here in Alaska there is nothing better than a set of soft, warm, flannel sheets on a cold winter night. They are nice in the summer as well",0
5751,"Cuisinart Mini-Prep - Worth the Money. This unit is worth the 39.99 price.  I've had it for about 2 years now.  I don't have a need for a large processor.  I just want to chop and grind stuff in a hurry.I always leave it on my counter as it has a small footprint.  Its easy to take apart and the cup and lid will go right in the dishwasher (top rack).This week I used it to chop pickles and olives together for a tuna salad.  I was done in less than a minute.Try it, you'll like it",0
5752,"Bigger than expected. What can you say, it's a garlic keeper? I used to keep garlic on my counter in a small dish. This garlic keeper is pretty and covered and keeps garlic out of sight. It matches in color with the butter keeper I bought, so it works well for me and keeps my counter looking better organized. I like that it's bigger than expected. I can keep 4-6 bulbs in it",0
5753,"Surprisingly Cool. I have sworn by air conditioners since I was a child, keeping it cranked on high all day and night to keep me as cool as possible in otherwise HOT conditions. However having recently moved out from my parents I was faced with the dilema of air conditioners high energy costs, not to mention the cost of an AC itself. I was at first disinclined toward the window fan (having never used one) remembering all the slow oscilating fans that did NOTHING to cool me off. well to my suprise it drops the temperature in my room so low I need a blanket (just how I like it). this units design allows one side of the fan to intake cool air and the other to exhaust hot air at the touch of a button (or have them both do the same thing) which adds greatly to the convience this is a huge plus cinsidering most window fans I have seen require you to manually take the fan out of the window and turn it around to exhause air. All these great features accompanied with a low price tag and low energy costs (80% less than an air conditioner) and the lazy mans IR remote make this one fine package that, as it appears so far, will get me through the hot summers cooler and cheaper. five stars, does what it says it can do and very well. Now I am going to my bedroom, better put on a sweater",0
5754,Nice pillow for Star Wars fan. This is a nice pillow for a Star Wars fan,0
5755,"Le Creuset Tagine. I have found this to be valuable addition to my kitchen. I am interested in Mediterranen cooking and this is a traditional form in Morocco. This is a low-fuel cooker, never used above a medium setting on a cooktop and used to simmer for long periods on low or very low. Uses very little liquid with the unique Tagine shape; do not overfill or you will have a mess. This is a great way to make stews and braises! Long cooking allows flavors to mingle. It cooks for 4 but is not big enough to serve large groups unless used in a multi-course meal; a bigger size would be nice to add. Would love to have more recipes",0
5756,"Good but. My microwave arrived today - it was the Sharp R model.  Arrived very quickly and I was thrilled with the speedy shipping.  I can always count on Amazon for quick delivery.You can imagine my disappointment when the microwave door wouldn't open no matter what we did.  The booklet was inside the microwave so we had to pry the door with a knife to see what we were doing wrong.  As it turned out I called Sharp and they gave me some names to call for a repair.  The 1st place I called said they would need the microwave for a week, the second couldn't be sure how long it would be away from here.  Finally I called the third place in Franklin, MA and we brought it to them.  When we got inside the repair person met us with a rolling cart, brought the item in the back and within 10 minutes had it fixed.  It was just a missing part.  So now the microwave is in my kitchen and I tried it as soon as I arrived home and it works perfectly.  Great size, lots of power.Happy with purchase - this was the first thing I bought from Amazon that even had a hint of a problem.",0
5757,"Most amazing!. This is probably the best knife I have ever owned.  Never dull, and always a smooth cutting experience.  This knife has never let me down.  Before owning this knife I didn't think it mattered what I used to cut up food items.  Boy, was I wrong.  I love the hollow edge technique.  It really does keep the food from sticking to the knife!  It is worth spending the extra money on a few really good knives that you will never have to replace.  I would also recommend a good knife sharpener.  With those two items you will never have to purchase another knife again",0
5758,My cat loves these. My cat loves these.  As soon as I opened the package my cat came running and started to play.  He usually gets bored with the toys I buy fairly quickly but he still loves these months later.  The price was good too.  In the local stores it's costs this much for just 6 mice not 12.

5762,"Very, very nice!. This is the piece I was dying to try and I'm not one bit sorry I got it. Being cast, it cooked a great paprikash evenly although it extends beyond the burner quite a bit. There was no real 'hotspot', which there won't be if you follow use instructions for heat. I love the way it goes into the oven right from the stovetop. I'd read some questions in a forum about a sticking problem and the recommendation was to heat the piece thoroughly before putting in the food, then to keep the flame lower and let the natural characteristics of the pot do the work. It worked like a charm! Easy cleaning, even with a long cook time. No burned garlic and onions in the saute, either. This is a wonderful piece",0
5763,Space Effecient. I really like this appliance.  It does a good job toasting my bread and microwaving my food if necessary.

5765,"Emerilware Stainless Cookware. I've had this cookware almost a year and really like it. The glass lids allow me to see inside the pot as it's cooking and I don't find that the lid gets hot like others have reported. The small loop handles on the pots do get hot, but I just use a hotpad. I don't have a problem with food sticking as I don't cook on high heat. I bought a nonstick pan to compliment the set and use that when needed. The copper around the bottom of these stainless pans is so pretty but will tarnish - it cleans up so quickly and easily (you just wipe) with Barkeeper's Friend cleaner. I can't wait to have a house again and hang these pretty pans",0

I used it this evening to prepare brown rice for dinner, a bit of an acid test in my mind for any rice cooker. The rice turned out flawless -- luscious, plump, flavorful, soft and not chewy, and not burnt at all. Clean-up was simple and easy. The instructions were easy to follow. The power cord is retractable which is a plus for keeping one's countertops clear of too many cords. I look forward to trying the other features of this cooker, perhaps even making a simple cake with it. The instruction manual includes sample recipes as well. All in all, highly recommended and very competitive with the Zojirushi models I considered but which are more expensive. You just can't go wrong with Panasonic",0

5787,"One of our best wedding gifts!. My husband and I received this as a wedding present. I had never heard of this product, but it is one of our favourite gifts. I am not experienced with slow cookers, but I understand one of the disadvantages of slow cookers is that you sometimes  have to worry about your food scalding. That is not a concern with the thermal cooker. We typically use it for soups and chili. You do have to actually cook it first (the inner pot can go on the stove) and bring it to a boil. Then just place the pot in the thermal cooker and leave it for HOURS without worry of burning. It's hot, good and clean up is easy. We love it",0

The chair was on sale for $24.99 and shipping was $32. Its still worth the $58 I paid alltogether.",0
5789,"Best Wine Opener Available!. *****This is by far the best wine opener I have ever used.  It is beautiful, a work of art, just to start with--therefore it can be left out and does make a great conversation piece. (I have the ""clear"" WineMaster.)It works wonderfully, from the attached foil cutter, to the heavy duty parts--everything does what it is supposed to.  First, you lock the opener onto the bottle.  This took me a few tries to understand, but now that I understand the concept it is a piece of cake to do (I'm not great with mechanical things).   Then you manipulate the levers (raise/lower the long ones and the short ones each once) and very easily not only does the cork come right out, but it is easily released from the opener so that you can save it if you want to, and it is not damaged.It is well worth the price.

As a pitcher, the handle is large and comfortable,and the spout is well-designed and prevents those irritating drips that happen with shorter spouts. As a vase, it'll win you a zillion compliments. My cats have managed to knock it over a couple times, even though it's quite heavy, and there's not a chip to be seen.

But then again, I never tried to ""grill"" a burger in the microwave??? One side is smooth, I assume for defrosting and the other has elevated ""grill"" lines. The fat drains off nicely which I store in a baby food jar in the fridge to flavor veggies, etc. When I bought this product it did not come with a grill cover.

If you just fried fish, it's going to smell like, ... uhm... fried fish.Cleanup is incredibly easy, stainless steel looks sexy in my kitchen, and I'm very pleased with this fryer so far.

5805,Love Fiestaware. My husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me. I thought okay until I opened the package. This shamrock green is so pretty. This dinnerware is great. A nice heavyweight.

5813,"Yep, it's that good. Preliminary review: I just used the aeropress for the second time and am very happy with it. I've read the reviews here and at [...] and as effusive as they were, I had one over-riding concern: would the coffee be too bland and not strong enough (with a slight bitter kick) for my taste? I like coffee black and strong; always have and always will. , Good espresso is heavenly. Therefore all the reviews about how ""smooth"" the aeropress coffee is made me wary. I like a touch of bitterness and distrusted the c.170 degree recommended water temperature.Anyways, the espresso came out nice and thick, very full-bodied and rich. There also was a very nice combination of enough acid with a heavy, rich taste experience. The complexity of some good beans came through, and perhaps were even enhanced over my good french press. I'm delighted.I'll come back and expand when I've used this a bit more, but as for now I highly recommend the aeropress and can assure those who may have similar concern that a hand-press won't deliver ""real espresso"": It does. One more word: There is real crema if one firmly pumps down an inch or two of air on top of the grounds. The quality of the crema is just so-so, (light, with no distinction) but it's there. A professional espresso machine works at about 130psi (9-10 bars/atmospheres) to get the crema everyone loves; and that is one thing, and as far as I can tell, the only thing, out of reach for the aeropress.",0
5814,"A Must-Have for Tea Drinkers. I switched from coffee to tea a few months ago, purchased this unit and am completely happy with it ... I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's well made, ergonomic, well thought out, and a joy to use.  The Japanese think of everything.  A Japanese friend of mine told me that homes in Japan almost always have one of these units, or one like it.  Now that I drink only tea, I can understand why.The three temperature settings (well, four if you count boiling) are perfect.  208 is good for herbal teas, tissanes, and also the increasingly popular (and wonderful) Rooibos.  That's also a good temperature for ramen, oatmeal, etc.  195 is good for black tea and also oolong, and 175 is good for green tea or white tea.  Now, you can make gourmet tea properly with no muss and no fuss.  Just get yourself some gourmet loose tea, herbal tea, or Rooibos, (all available from Garrett, Adagio, or Teavana), and a convenient brewer, like ""IngenuiTea"" from Adagio (Teavana also makes a good one that might be slightly better in quality), and you will be good-to-go!  Your taste buds will thank you and so will your body.  (The health benefits of green tea and oolong are well-known, and also Rooibos has 30-50 times the antioxidants of green tea, and no caffeine).  My blood pressure has dropped 20 points with less caffeine (compared to caffeine in coffee, black tea = 20-25%, oolong = 10-15%, green = 5-10%, white = 1%, rooibos and herbal = 0%).Buy a Zojirushi!  You won't be disappointed.",0

5816,"Upper back pains solved. I spent a lot of time and money on physical therapy for my weak upper back muscles.  I've tried all sorts of specialized pillows for years -- buckwheat pillows, down/feather pillows, contour pillows, memory foam pillows etc.  This was the only one that made me wake up in the mornings with no upper back pain.  It also works for my husband who likes to sleep on his side because the individual coils adjust to support the head and neck separately",0
5817,Le Creuset Mini Cocotte. This miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces,0
5818,"Great, well-made product. Love the tilt function. I bought this slicer after very extensive comparison.  I wanted a slicer with a stronger motor, but was undecided if I really needed the tilt feature.  This slicer is very well made.  It cuts meats very thin.  I thought I would need to buy the optional blade for thin cuts, but the blade it comes with has worked perfectly for me.  I have cut up ham  and meat roasts.  The taste is wonderful, not to mention the cost savings.  I also have cut thick steaks (the ones at Costco) thinner to make steak sandwiches.  The tilt feature is advertised to gravity feed vegetables.  I use if for meat as well because the food falls away from the blade.  It is much safer and I can cut a large amout before I need to remove the accumulating pile of cut food.  I highly recommend this product.  I was also very concerned that cleaning could be so time-consuming that it might cause me to not use the product as often.  This is not the case, clean-up is a breeze and can be completed in less than 10 minutes.",0
5819,"Eclipse 12 used for Dwarf Seahorses. I purchased an Eclipse 12 so I could set it up as a habitat for dwarf seahorses.  I put a filter sponge over the intake pipe so the adults and babies would not get pulled into the filter.  I set the tank up 3 weeks before I got the seahorses so it could fully cycle.  After it was cycled I purchased 14 adult dwarf seahorses from a local dealer (I life in FL).  Within 48 hours, 2 males had given birth and another gave birth yesterday and I have seen pairs doing the courting dance so I know more babies will be on the way.  I have lost only one adult so far and the rest appear to be thriving.  I keep the tank full of newly hatched baby brine shrimp for them to feed on and I do a one gallon water change per day.  This tank is the perfect size for a population of dwarf seahorses and the filter does not make too much turbulence for them.  The lighting is enough to keep caulerpa (macro agae) and I also have a gorgonian coral in there as well.  I have always wanted to keep seahorses and now I am keeping them and raising them thank to my Eclipse 12",0
5820,"Very satisfied. This is a sturdy well made appliance.   A little soak, soap & wash gets any food   that might be  leftover in the textured surface.

5827,"AWESOME PRODUCT!!. I bought this for my older cat who has no body fat on her. It serves a dual purpose in that it protects her favorite chair from the majority of the hair she sheds; but the best thing about it is the warmth it provides to her. Yes, it does ""crinkle"" as the previous reviewer said. That didn't bother my cat though. She took to it right away. The faux fur provides comfort and warmth and the ""crinkly"" stuff on the inside reflects back her body heat. I rested my feet and calves on it one day while I was napping on the couch; I can verify that it actually works in reflecting back your body heat; my legs were kept toasty by this pad. No wonder my cat loves it. Highly recommended",0

5835,"Heavy Weight Guest Towels. Columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time I didn't use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom. The color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender, they call it Plumberry. The weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well, that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it. When the washcloths are completely drenched, they do seem a little more heavy than most, although they have that ""spa feel"" to them and they retain heat very well, which makes them sort of comforting. I've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent I've found. They are made with 100% combed cotton and have a heavier feel. The edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don't fall apart the first time you wash them.~The Rebecca Review",0
5836,"Does just what it says it does. I've owned my Duet for well over 2 years and I'm a bit baffled by the negative reviews I'm reading here at Amazon.  Perhaps Cuisinart has produced a few lemons?  I've had absolutely no problems with it and it hasn't even hinted at breakage, cracking, or anything else.  I use it several times per week, both blending and food processing and overall, I'm very satisfied.Combining a powerful motor with the dual functions of processing and blending is a natural idea and works well.  Switching between blending and processing is quick and easy and the pieces fit well together with no leakage and seamless operation.  The base houses the power and the Duet really does blend as well as any blender I've ever used including the Waring Pro.  The buttons are flush and seamless with the display background, so cleanup is easy and the base is heavy, solid, and will not tip over easily.  The blender blades are sharp, so handle and wash them with care.The processor bowl is a bit small and is good for small and medium-sized tasks such as making salsa, pesto, sauces, tapenade, etc.  The shredder/slider insert works like a charm and I've used it mainly for vegetables and cheeses.  The placement is just about perfect and although others have complained that the feeding tube is too small, I've never had a problem inserting everything/anything into it and obtaining the desired results.  It's really pretty logical.Any gripes?  Besides the processor bowl being small, my main complaint concerns the number of speed selections.  The selections go from stir to chop to ice crush to food processor and the difference between chop and ice crush is a huge one.  I would prefer that there be an intermediate speed that allows for a quick blend with less of a danger of pureeing the blender's contents than if ice crush or food processor is selected.  Since all the speeds apply to both blending and processing, this would be a logical improvement.  Another improvement would be a better-fitting clear plastic insert to the blender lid.  Mine is too loose and considering this is placed over rapidly gyrating liquids, a tighter fit would give me more confidence that I'm avoiding flying food.Again, I've had no reliability/durability issues with the Duet.  Other than a couple of minor design flaws, I enjoy using it regularly.  Here are a few tips that might help you enjoy your appliances for a longer period:Although many companies claim their products are dishwasher safe, it's better to hand wash as many pieces as is logical.  In this case, hand wash the blender blade mechanism -- doing so will maintain the sharpness of the blades and the plastic attachment pieces will fit better longer and won't crack or break.  Use hot, soapy water and a mild detergent.  Pieces like the processor and blender bowls should be sanitized in the dishwasher.Handle your appliances with care.  Don't toss them around or bang them against other objects.  Store them carefully by avoiding piling things on top of them or shoving them into too-small spaces.  Put pieces and attachments together carefully.If possible, roughly cut up your food prior to processing and blending.  This will assist in achieving the desired results and will avoid problems like unprocessed lumps, inconsistent blending, or sudden bursts within the food bowl.  It also reduces the need to stop the machine and scrape the sides.  Don't just shove the food in, turn it on and expect great results.Remember, these are not commercial-grade appliances and as another reviewer has mentioned, even if they were, a professional would not abuse his/her equipment.  Treat your appliances well and they'll do the same for you.  The Cuisinart SmartPower Duet is no exception.Recommended.",0

5839,"GREAT COUNTERTOP WATER SYSTEM. We used the Britta system for almost 9 years to filter our nasty tasting local water.  We were becoming dissatisfied with the ""floating"" carbon particles with each filter change and found that the filters were not taking out all of the bad taste.  We decided to give the PUR countertop system a try - about the same price as Britta to set up - and were amazed at the better quality of filtered water! The taste is great and no more carbon floaters from the filters.  The only ""complaint"" would be that these filters are harder to find and more expensive than Britta.  The extra cost is worth it",0

They fold neatly, take up little cabinet space, etc.However, it does NOT say on the package that they are microwave or freezer safe. I find that info only here on AMazon which leaves me wondering...are they or aren't they?Secondly, because the flattened containers have to be pushed open, these might be difficult for an elderly person to handle. It isn't exactly hard to do but does take at least normal strength, average strength, not something a weak, ill or otherwise impaired person might manage. Other than that, I think they are great. They clean up nicely, store food, the lids stay in place, etc.Now if I only know about their microwave capabilities!",0

If you turn it on first, the thermometer will show the temperature of the air, then you stick it into the item and the display will slowly move to the temperature of the item.  This takes a bit of time.  So be sure you stick it into your item FIRST, let the metal acclimate to the temperature of the item, and then turn it on.  Then you'll get the instant read each time.I've washed this, I've dropped it, and it's still going strong.

It's like we're living like the Jetsons or the Exorcist.According to everyone who uses Black & Decker, this is a good coffee maker (and the white color matches everything else in the kitchen).  The only thing I don't know is if it's safe to get water under the coffee maker (since it's located next to the sink and no matter how hard you try, water will squirt over there).

I've read a few reviews here and they seem either fake or the folks didn't understand how to operate it and should probably go back to a Fry Daddy for simplicity.  The Euro does require that you get the unit set in the rails to trip the safety switch and you do need to keep this thing clean.  I change the oil about every 2 months - depending on how much protein I fry.  Nice to be able to put the tub in the dishwasher and looks like new upon reassembling.  The MAJOR difference between this unit and several others I've owned is the larger capacity (4 liters!).  Capacity is very important in keeping the oil to temperature and keeping the food less greasy.  In addition to the capacity, the wattage is upped to 1800 watts which is above par for consumer level fryers. This is one of the largest capacity home fryers around at this price.  Fried zucchini and mushrooms are simply restaraunt quality!  I also recommend experimenting with batters - search the net for this (i.e. use Italian dry mix in flour for a KFC type fried chicken - good stuff!)",0

Most vacuums are so loud and heavy that I hate to drag them out every time crumbs are dropped on the floor.  We also have a cat that likes to make a mess.  This product is an extra help around the litter box.  This product is very light and easy to use.  The handle swivels with ease so you can get things at an angle and the base isn't too tall to fit under the couch.  I have been using mine for about 7 months and have yet to have a problem with it,0
5873,"Best stand fan. It is powerful, attractive, and extremely reliable. Easy to assemble and the remote is great",0
5874,Great silverware. Very good quality silverware.  We bought it to match with an existing set of Henckles silverware.  This Oneida is holding up to washings and little kids much better than the Henckles has.Excellent product!,0
5875,"Dyson. Impressive machine overall.  I've had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch.  Looking around on the internet, this seems to be fairly common.  I understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things, but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine.The attachments are great for hard floors, and furniture.I am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time I use the machine, but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point, even the refurbished one",0
5876,"Fiesta Ware. I have used the same Fiesta Ware for the last 12 years and I have not broken a piece yet!  Even when my 2 teenage boys were babies, and doing dishes, a piece may have slipped out of their hands, but nothing was ever broken.  This shows how durable the Fiesta Ware really is.  I would highly recommend Fiesta Ware to everyone of all ages.  I own 3-20 piece settings at the present time and plan on expanding.  I like the fact that you can collect all different colors and it looks great!  I will be ordering more for when my 2 boys go to college.  I plan on ordering my mother a 20 piece set for her birthday.  I love it and I know you would toooo",0
5877,Good Report on  Dualit Toaster. For more years then I want to count I have been fussing with one or more Big Box Store toasters and found they all came up realy short on many fronts. I decided to purchase the Dualit as an alternative to the morning frustrations. I am thrilled with it's operation and do agree that any number on the dial above 3 is only there to make a person feel powerful as they are not needed. Thanks again for building a fine product,0
5878,great skillets. These are just great and the price sure is right....the large skillet is deep and great for frying....about $20.00 cheaper then the cheapest place I found.....I love them and you will to..,0
5879,"LTD is the absolute BEST!. This cookware is without peer. I know, I have been using my first LTD pan since 1989 and have purchased many others since. That 1989 pan still looks nearly new. LTD cooks better than anything else and cleans like a dream. The unfortunate, dissatisfied person that put this cookware into a dishwasher, simply did not read or heed the care instructions provided by All-Clad. There is absolutely no reason to ever even think of putting an LTD or ANY fine pan into a dishwasher. And even though this person has damaged the appearance of this pan, its use and cooking performance have been unaffected. Any cooked on food can be removed without effort by simply soaking it with soap and warm water. The exterior is best cleaned with a paste made of ""Barkeepers Friend"" and water applied with minimal elbow grease and a cloth. This will remove ALL traces of oil or grease residue, just like All-Clad recommends. Finally, I believe that, with a minimum of reasonable care, LTD cookware will provide a lifetime of daily pleasurable cooking experience and is worth every single penny of its cost. All-Clad guarantees it in writing",0
5880,"great product. This product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments I had received there.  Zymox takes about a week to work, with one or two treatments a day.  It has had the same effect for my sister's dog who had had recurrent ear infections. I have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success",0
5881,Rooster Pasta Set. I'm very happy with this pasta set.  It exactly matches the dinnerware set and the quality is great.  The pasta bowl is HUGE!  I am considering a second set to complete 8 place settings.  The second pasta bowl would make an excellent salad bowl..,0
5882,"great so far. i've had mine 7 months, and used another one for much longer at a previous residence. never had the mold problem others have reported. i love it. the capacity is great and the nozzle is perfect for refilling bottles, and never drips. my only complaint used to be hauling it into the sink to fill, but my boyfriend had the brilliant idea to leave it on the counter and use the faucet hose. =",0
5883,"R2D2. Cute little pudge looks just like the charactor from Star Wars.  I bought a new stove and it gives one little buzz and then stops.  I was burning too many cookies, so I bought the Kitchenaid Timer. After years of plastic junk, I am very happy to have a quality timer.  It is completely enclosed, with no crevices, so you can pick it up with your gunky hands and just wipe it off when you're done.  It has an ingenius way of activating, but as soon as you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  It rings long and loud, which makes me happy",0
5884,"Great for ice cream and a hit with preschoolers. We use these for everything: berries, nuts, raisins, yogurt, ice cream.  My nephew loves them for his chocolate chips, Annie's bunny crackers, raisin and blueberry mixes, and frozen berries...and, of course, ice cream.  They're ideal for smaller portions.  They're easy to clean and dishwasher safe",0
5885,"Visual Wine Decanter. Very pretty, space efficient and the design allows for good aeration of the wine. This was a hit. The recommended knob I ordered was the only miss.",0
5886,"Great product. Just got this in the mail today - excellent addition to our 29 gallon tank!  We have two red-eared sliders, and they are still pretty small.  This ramp will accommodate them until their shell is about 3-4 inches in width.Super-easy to install.  Fast delivery as well, and item was packaged well",0
5887,"Great little machine. After reading many reveiews on this product I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I hate the public laundry so I thought this would be a little bit better even if I had some of the problems other people had mentioned. I had the same problems with the screws that every one else did. The screws dont match up to the holes to screw on the bottom panel. You have to kind of force them in where they dont belong and then screw them on. I also have to weigh down the water out house into the sink or it will flip out of the sink from the water pressure and end up all over the floor. I thought it would be sufficent enough to just place it in the sink, however I learned my lesson after the first load! You can fit quite a bit in it despite the small size, however I would not try to overload the washer as the water level will get too high and overflow. I am able to wash with the water level on high as long as the washer is not too stuffed up. Overall if you can iron out the little kinks with the washer, it is much better than public laundry and will save you a lot of money over the long run. As opposed to the rolling thing for the bottom I got those furniture sliders and they work GREAT to move it from one side of the kitchen to the next.",0
5888,"Beautiful dishes. Dishes are just as pretty as they look but are not quite as bright colored as they show.  Are a nice color, would not want them any brighter. Plates and bowls are a nice size. Cup could be a little bigger but the size most sets carry. Waiting for add on pieces. I have a light tan colored rice bowl and vegetable size bowls from my other set that I bought seperately that matches these pretty well that I kept.  Like the rice bowl size really well for soups. They are Corelle extras. Rgis is my 3rd set of Corelle.",0
5889,"Great little oven. This is a great little oven.  It reaches temperature fast and it stays at temperature.  The convection oven fan is a little noisy, but not annoying.  The rotisserie feature works great, but don't expect to do any large items.  Cornish hens is the limit or a very small chicken. This oven works great for drying peppers.  I use my drying racks from my old Toastmaster convection oven",0
5890,"Must have for wood and tile floors!. When we purchased our Dyson, I read about this tool in some of the reviews and decided to purchase the Factory-Reconditioned unit and use the money we saved to get this accesory.This was a great choice, we love the vacuum and this tool does an outstanding job on our wood and tile floors.  I think it does a great job on steps also.  It has greatly expanded the functionality of the basic Dyson, and is well worth the extra cost",0
5891,cats are never thirsty. the capacity is great. We have several cats and one small dog and the dish is never dry.  We only need to fill it every other day.The biggest part is keeping an eye on the tank.  I wish the flow was a little stronger but that is on another model.  Very happy with the delivery time and all of the packing to make sure it got to me in one piece,0
5892,"Top rate multi-purpose sheet!. As a serious cook, I look for tough uncoated surfaces that won't rust or require such ginger care. The pan is sturdy, priced right, fits perfectly in the oven without a rack and cleans up like a dream. NordicWare is great!Whether roasting vegetables, roasting a turkey or baking sheets of brownies or cookies, it distributes heat evenly without burning and does a consistent job every time. No need for wooden or teflon utensils, you can use whatever you want, whenever you want. If you're looking for a non-stick surface, add parchment or a silpat that browns cookies evenly and lets you slide them right off.I like this pan so much, I own 4 so I can rotate them and do a great amount of baking without waiting for the sheets to cool. It also ensures they stack nicely in the cabinet. The lid is a nice addition, making it convenient and secure to store cookies and brownies right on the sheet without removing them or worrying if the saran wrap or foil will slip off.Bravo",0
5893,Wusthof Slicer. Was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law and he was very pleased. This is the second Wusthof knive I have given him.  Excellent,0
5894,"sturdy and convenient. With six children, myself and my husband, sometimes just collecting the laundry from all over the house leaves me worn out.  That's why I like the wheels on this hamper; they help conserve my energy, and I need all the energy I can get.  Plus this hamper can hold all the laundry from my laundry chute, and it's construction seems sturdy.  It was pretty easy to assemble",0
5895,"Nice looking and Useful. Came on time and in great condition.  I use a lot of European recepies, so I stumble on a lot of metric measurements; so I am happy to know that this scale provides weight in grams/kilos/lbs/oz.  Very useful to me as I cook a lot from scratch",0
5896,The Best!. This is such a great pan for omlets because of the sloped sides that allow you to slide underneath.  This would be a great first peice of cast iron for someone new to using it because of the size and it is pre-seasoned.  I use it all the time &amp; it just keeps getting better,0
5897,feels great. no complain! felt very good to touch. wormed me during very cold nights.I wish if I had more options in the choice of color,0
5898,Relaxing!. I tend to stress out a bit so my husband bought me this for my office as a stress reliever.  I love it! It is a great way to zone out for a little while.,0
5899,FIESTA!. This is a great idea!  Everyone should have AT LEAST ONE of these ~ personally I'd get one for every member of the household.  The well is perfect so theres no slipping or sliding and it can easily be carried without having to worry about it falling off.  We love this.  And this is a great color.  So much prettier than the picture.,0
5900,"Regarding DeLonghi. I have had a DeLonghi for several years now (different model). To be sure, I have had to replace the grommet and the stupid plastic ""crema maker."" I poked around in my phone book a bit, got the parts without problem. The plastic part broke again, but I find I really don't care -- it has no impact on the coffee",0
5901,"Great gate, but read my review before buying. I just bought this gate because I needed something semi-permanent in my living room to keep my new puppy from running all over the house. My first gate looked very cheap and kept falling down because it didn't have a door and I just propped it against the wall. I needed a gate with a door.I checked at least 3 different sites besides Amazon for a ""rich"" looking gate WITH a door. I landed on this one.PROS:1.) Looks nice and elegant2.) The door swings open both ways (very nice)3.) Brown / tan (much nicer than the plastic grey colors like Grayco)4.) Solid design (wood and steel, nice)5.) The gate locks at the top and the bottom at the same time, making it impossible for my puppy to push his way through at the bottom.6.) Lock is nicely positioned (but see #5 in the CONS below).CONS:1.) ONLY the door is wood, ALL of the gate material is metal. Would be nicer is the entire gate was the same wood and the hardware was metal.2.) The door does not swing 180 degrees open. The door only opens to about 110 degrees so because it's not flush with the gate, my dog or kids sometimes run into it.3.) The color of the gate does not match the door. It's close and it compliments it, but it's not a match.4.) The rubber feet that touch the wall (I'm not talking about the adjuster knobs, because they are brown) to hold it in place against the wall are grey. At this price, they should be brown to match the gate. I don't know how the company missed this one.5.) The handle to open the gate only works in ""baby-proof"" mode. I which you could deactivate the thumb button and make it so that you only have to lift up on the handle to open. Not the thumb & lift up. Just a convenience thing. It's sometimes a little tricky when both your handles are full with grocery bags.6.) The screws are shiny silver. They should have painted them brown as well. (Richell, it your reading this, you could have anodized them dark brown like some many other screws, that way they're less noticeable.)7.) THIS IS THE BIGGY **IMPORTANT** This gate only works in certain segments. Unless you're really handy with tools and a welding torch you must pay attention to this. This gate will ONLY fit on the following openings, NO EXCEPTIONS:35"" to 37"" with no side gates (just door)47"" to 49"" with one side gate attached59"" to 61"" with both side gates attachedWhen I bought this gate, I didn't understand this and I was lucky that my opening is 47"". If it was only 45"" I would have had to return this gate. There is no way around this.Overall this is a quality gate, but just know what you're getting.I would buy this gate again if I had to make this choice all over.I gave this gate 4 stars instead of 5 because only the door was wood. If the gates and door were wood, I would have given it 5 stars",0
5902,A great way to prevent a fire!. I purchased this for my mother who has melted more than one pan on her stove and has collection pot and pans with delaminated bottoms.  She finds this timer very easy to set and very good at waking her when she wears it around her neck,0
5903,Excellent Quality. I received my roaster within 3 days of ordering.  It was excellent quality and made of commercial-grade aluminum with a thick bottom on the pan.  The lid fit tightly and allowed the food to cook properly with no loss of moisture.  I would highly recommend this product.  Thanks Amazon,0
5904,Great towels for price!. Purchased  5 sets of these towels.Bought 2 sets at 29.99 apiece and 3 sets at 19.99 apiece.Very soft and large towels.Very pleased with this purchase.Found some loose threads but not significant enough to complain about.Recommend buying as this was a great deal for a high quality item.Plan on ordering more,0
5905,"maryM. This is an excellent pressure cooker at an excellent price. I do feel they should have included a trivet and metal plate. All of the accessories are extra.I ordered the canning rack which holds 4 pints. I don't believe it would be wise to try to can quarts in this one, but the directions were not clear. In fact, I would have given this a much higher rating if they were, but I had trouble figuring out how to use it...and one does want to follow directions where a pressure cooker is concerned. They kept referring to to pressures, hi and low. I finally realized the 6 qt model has both but not the 10 and the directions were applicable to each model. The 10 quart pressures at 15 lbs....FAST!I once had Fagor 6 qt model and the  metal was heavier than this one. However, the upside is that it is easier to lift up to pour things from it which is a plus if you're elderly as I am.I really like they way this cooks; fast, easy to clean. It's beautifully designed pan.There are numerous uses for non-pressure cooking too. Big enough for a stock pot, cooking spagetting for a crowd, etc etc.I haven't canned with it. However, I plan on making a big pot of soup and canning what's left.One reviewer mentioned that you can't fill it over 2/3 full. That is true of ANY pressure cooker. So if you are debating between a 6 quart or a 10 quart, go for the 10 quart.There are additional accessories for this..canning rack, bucket insert (for spaghetti, etc.)  I recommend getting the lid for non-pressured food and keep the pressure lid for pressure.I don't think you will be disappointed with this product.",0
5906,"A point of clarification. So that other readers are not mislead:A tea pot is designed to hold hot water and tea leaves so as to steep the tea.A tea kettle is designed to hold water to be heated, preferably on the stove top.I do not recommend using a microwave to heat water as that method of heating invariably seems to alter the flavor of the water - at least if you are serious about your tea",0
5907,"Polycarbonate is the way to go!. These polycarbonate glasses are terrific! What the manufacturer says is true:  They really don't break and they don't show wear from the dishwasher.  I suppose if you tried jumping up and down on one or ran over it with a steam roller, it make break.  But these glasses have survived my three kids, and that's a pretty big feat.  And they look great.  Just like glass.  You might think it's made of glass until you pick it up.  A great product for people with kids, or for use in your RV, on your boat, out on the patio, by the pool, etc.",0
5908,microsuede duvet set. Great duvet and pillow shams for the price.  Soft and comfortable.a great buy,0
5909,Perfect for a meal serving!. This plate is perfect for serving a nice amount of food in the center of the table or for a larger single meal for one person.  Very sturdy but not overly-heavy.  The Sango Gold Dust set has been very nice!  Amazon.com is the only place I can find the accesories for this set at a reasonable price.  And most of them you cant find in the store,0

5915,Milano Espresso To Go. I love the end product. Has the appearance and feel of a chair worth twice the price and was exactly what I wanted.However!!! The instructions for assembly leave certain steps to the imagination. At one point in the assembly there were 2 possible ways to go. I guessed correctly and did not have to backtrack and take anything apart. A bit of a frustrating experience to say the least.Is the frustration worth it? Without a doubt,0
5916,"So far so good. This item has broken on a few people, so I will update this  review if it breaks.  So far I really like it.  The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it seems a tad tall for no real reason.  Otherwise it is great.  The grind indicator works well once you get a feel for it, although you can do about as well by  looking at the grinds yourself as it is grinding.  It is also nice that is has a skinny middle coated with rubber so it is easy to hold without slipping.  I guess making the skinny middle part may be why it is a bit tall.  The look is realy cool and the wind up cord is great too.Ok, the update: three years later in 2006 this thing is still going strong, despite my dumping boiling water in it to clean it and doing other non-manufacturer-approved stuff to it.  Two thumbs up",0

5926,"Cuisinart's Chef's Classic Series is a Best Value. We have owned varies types of cookware in the past 20+ years.  Some we have had to throw away, some were passed down to the kids.  However this is by far the best cookware we have every owned.  I never buy anything with first researching the product. I spent hours comparing the various brands of stainless steel cookware based on the various styles of cooking we do.  You name the brand and I more then likely looked at it.  The Chef's Classic Series is every bit as good as the some of the more expensive brands on the market today.  It transfers and holds the heat very well.  It cooks at a fraction of the temperature of lesser quality cookwares.  The handles are comfortable in your hand.   Even filled, they do not feel over whelming heavy but at the same time they have a solid, sturdy feel.  They feel balanced!  Clean up was always a problem with the other stainless steel cookware we owned but not with these.  I'm actually surprised how easily food releases with only minimal oil.

We had hoped that this vacuum would have a thicker brush to protect new hardwood floors.  Since it is advertised as a hardwood floor vacuum we assumed it would have a soft brush that would gently touch the wood floor.  Instead, it has hard plastic wheels with a short, firm brush.

I figured if I got a cool gadget that also cleans maybe they will us it.  well, my plan worked perfectly!  not only do they use it in the kitchen, but the bathroom as well.  It does a great job cleaning the floors.  They only thing I would suggest is making sure that you completely vacuum the floor first.  If your floor is heavily soiled (like theirs was) it may take some elbow grease on the first try.  After that keep up is easy",0

5937,Fabulous Flowing Chocolate. I recently purchased this item and used it for a party of about 40 people.  I had read the reviews on-line and decided on this one for the price that I wanted to spend.  We had to add a little extra oil at first to be sure that there were no clumps in it when we started the fountain up.  I had read some reviews where some people said the units that they bought were noisy and were only good for about an hour before the chocolate started to clump up.  This model works GREAT! It was relatively quiet also.  The chocolate was still flowing after everyone had left that evening.  We ran it for a good 5 hours and it worked super!  I purchased Nestle Chocolate Chips at the grocery store and followed the guidlines in the book that comes with it.  We melted the chocolate with the added Canola Oil in the microwave before adding it to the fountain.  Clean up was very easy! I can't wait to use it again for our up-coming daughter's college graduation party in May and our wedding in July.  Amazon services are also great,0

5940,"Good little gadget for the price. Like another reviewer, I was skeptical about this, but I wanted a frother to give as a Christmas gift and was willing to risk 20 bucks.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Okay, it's not a fancy automatic steamer/frother, but it does what it claims--creates froth out of milk.  It seems to froth cold milk better than warmed milk, but I've been happy with both.  I didn't have much trouble putting in the batteries, and the stand could seem top-heavy, but we haven't knocked it over.  Only thing I wish could be improved--seems like a lower speed might work a little better--the speed of the frothing tip moves the milk so far to the side of the mug that it spills out.  I've had better success using a wide-mouth ""latte mug"" than a regular size cup or pint pitcher",0
5941,TO CUTE COOKIE JAR. THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY BOSS WHO IS VERY PICKY AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.  THIS WAS THE PERFECT GIFT.  IT WAS VERY VERY CUTE,0
5942,"Nice product. I bought this for my office.  I looks great, and works fine.  It also was received very fast.  I was amazed how quickly I received it.  One issue though; it has one of the most lacking owner's manuals, so be prepared for trial and error.  I know a fridge is not the most complicated equipment, but I had to guess which way the cold adjustment knob was supposed to go to make the fridge colder.  The knob is also down in the back, so if you have to adjust, it is a bit of a reach.  Now that I figured things out, though, I really am pleased",0

5944,"Fabulous little hot water pot!. We love this pot, and keep hot water available 24 hours--nice to grab that lunchtime soup or late-night cup of camomile tea. It is easy to use (pour in water & plug in) and pour (push down on circle which depresses on top of lid). Great value! This was a surprise appliance in the best possible way--never expeccted to like it so much or use it so constantly on the kitchen counter--good looking too! Jil",0
5945,"Nice Liquid Soap Dispenser. I like this soap dispenser because:1. it's big and I don't have to refil it often;2. when filled up  with detergent, body lotion or what have you, it gets heavier and won't move when you press the pump;3. the advertised non slip base really works;4. the top part of the pump itself is big enough so that you don't necessarily need your finger to push it (like when you already have a sponge in your hand or something you still can get the pump to work by pressing it with the side of your hand, forearm, etc.);5. the pump is made out of plastic and you won't end up with a yucky, stinky gunk on your hands like you would if the pump were made out of metal;6. has no metal details on the base, so no rusty bottoms that leave nasty ring stains on your countertop;7. it does what it's supposed to do everytime you pump the pump, meaning you get a fair amount of whatever you have inside the dispenser.Simple as that!",0
5946,"Great shakers. These are really great shakers.  They're pretty small though so don't plan on serving corn on the cob to 10 people and expecting it to last through the dinner.  They look fantastic on a table display and really add flair to your decorating.  They're functional, but they really could stand to be a little bigger. I'm happy with them though - the plum are just gorgeous",0
5947,"It's worth the money. It's a handy gadget to have around the kitchen, and also for cleaning up the toothpaste blobs in the bathroom sink.  My only complaint is that the battery life isn't very long, and I don't like putting disposable batteries in the trash.  I fixed that by getting a universal battery charger and some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  Problem solved",0
5948,"Flexible in shape and in color. I bought both of my boys this hamper when I redecorated their rooms.  It goes with anything, and the mesh allows the clothes to breathe between laundry days. I wish it was a bit larger in capacity, but 9 and 11 year old boys seem to get their clothes in there, and when it is full to the top, then they know it's time to bring their hampers to the laundry room.  Also, we plan to bring one with us on vacations now, because it is easy to collapse and pack",0

When I have freinds over for dinner, they comment on how cute it is. The ringer is loud enough that I can hear it anywhere in my  1 level apt.  If you are upstairs or downstairs you might not be able to hear it as well though. If you are looking for a cute, basic timer, this is it :-",0

After much research and looking at different triply/clad cookware from Henckels, Kitchenaid, Calphalon, and ALL Clad, I decided on Gourmet Standard.  I am very glad I did.  The cookware is beautiful and the stainless steel and aluminum is thicker than all the other name brands mentioned above except for ALL Clad, which I think is a bit thicker.Compared to All Clad, I feel it is a better value in terms of costs and the size of the pans you get.  Cook's Illustrated stated that this cooked just like All Clad.  So Save yourself some money and go with Gourmet Standard. It's also good for induction stoves",0
5954,"Item does work however, with patience. The apple slicer blade works nicely.  The large cut french fry slicer works but the secret is to place the large end of the potato under the blade first. Remember, these are manual type cutters that do require patience and safety issues.  I have used my cutters many times and they have not broken.  I am a small frame person with not much strength.  Do not try to slam the blade through the item all at one time.  Potatoes are more dense than an apple.  You have to master the use of these blades and they do work",0

I have yet to use it in the oven, but so far it is doing what the company claims it will do, and that is ""versatility!""  It cooks well and I think it's about time that slow cooker companies make their stoneware like this one.  Kudos to Rival!  The only knock is that the lid does not fit very flush against the edges, but it is also stoneware and just as versatile.  So if that is the only knock against it, bring it on! :",0
5961,"Nice product, but could be a little more flexible. I have a sort of spatula addiction.  I own far too many spatulas and always buy more looking for the ""perfect spatula"".  This one is a solidly good spatula.I like that it is wide enough to turn any food that I cook.  It is excellent with delicate food like fish, crab cakes or risotto cakes.   The width of this spatula would make it difficult to use in a tiny pan.  I haven't had any problem with pan size, because I use mostly 10 inch pans and wider.The bottom inch of the spatula is flexible, and after that it is rigid.  This spatula is a little thicker than I would like it to be.  But, if it were thinner it might be too flexible. I would like this spatula to be just a little more flexible.This spatula has been used most days in my kitchen for the last 6 months and so far is showing not signs of wear.  It is holding up better than most of the other nylon spatulas that I have purchased in the past.Overall this is good spatula that I would recommend.",0

5968,"cool concept for storage and dispensing. I absolutely love cereal and I just had to have this cereal dispenser. Easy to clean and assemble. It is a fun way to display your cereals and know how much it left before you need to purchase more. There have been way too many disappointing moments when I reached for my box and discovered that I only had less than a stale bowl left! I also bought this because it was stainless steel. Note that the base is the only stainless steel part. The lids and the knobs are NOT stainless steel (which I was disappointed to find out) but made out of plastic with a silver-like coating. I'm guessing that it would either fade or peel off with prolonged use.The first cereal I tried it with was my childhood favorite Lucky Charms. Unfortunately, as I turned the knob, some of my oats got crushed by the rubber :( Perhaps I stuffed it too much?! I also think you could use this product for other dried foods like peanuts, trail mix, or seeds and alike, but nothing big like chips or cheese curls which I am certain would get crushed when you turn the knob to dispense.I also find the product a bit overpriced, too. If the lids and knobs were really stainless steel it would have been more worthwhile.  However, I can't exactly complain when there are not too many competitors out there for this ""stainless steel"" product. For now, its is doable until the latest model comes out ;-)",0
5969,"Don't burn the macaroni. I purchased this pot in January, and have used it several times a week since.  I love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications, it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top (grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review).  The pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well, and I looked forward to years of use until I boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles.  The noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking, scrubbing, cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again.  Because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot, I will definatly be purchasing another pot.Overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price, so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch I would totally reccomend it just don't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes.",0
5970,"Super-nice fan ... Moves a LOT of air, nice controls, well-made, great fan!  My only problem with it was I didn't pay any attention to the HEIGHT dimensions and it won't fit in the window that I bought it for. :-(  Only negative is that it's not as quiet as I expected either",0
5971,Really NICE!!!. I am very impressed with this dog bed. It is very thick and has extra padding. The cover DOES come off for cleaning. The zipper is well hidden. The bed is also very in style for those hip puppies :,0
5972,"Great pan, but a little on the expensive side.. I love cooking in this pan. I love cooking in cast iron utensils in general of which I have a few (from Lodge). It looks great and cleans well. I don't understand the high price, however. It's just enamel on cast iron. Sure, the colors are attractive but then you don't get the special flavors you get from contact of the food with the iron as you do in the Lodge utensils. It's not some hi-tech product and you cannor really justify the cost. If this is expensive, the rest of the colors at $20 more are prohibitively costly. I can't see myself getting any more of Le Creuset products unless I get them in some special deal (as I did this one) or received them as gift",0

5976,"Mixed review. I bought one of these wafflers after doing more research than the subject warrants, I'm sure.  My local mom&pop carry this line so I purchased it from them.  The first waffler wouldn't heat up out of the box so I exchanged it - so far so good with the replacement.  This would be a 5-star review if the first unit had worked and if the ""Belgian Waffle"" recipe wasn't such a waste of supplies.First trial using the recipe booklet's recipe for ""Belgian waffles"" produced some rather inedible results.  Even my son the Hoover Vacuum thought they weren't very nice: the finished waffles were pale and spongy despite being baked at a thermostat setting of 6.Second trial run using my tried and true ""Joy of Cooking"" basic waffle produced well-baked if heavy waffles: crispy outsides, tender insides.  The vacuum pronounced them fit to eat and proceeded to tuck away 6 segments or 1.5 total waffles.This morning's recipe used a modified buttermilk waffle recipe from ""JoC"".  The results were light and crispy, well-browned, crispy on the outside, tender and airy on the inside.  My son got around two entire waffles.Modified recipe:Separate 3 eggs, melt a stick of butter.Whisk the yolks with 1.5c buttermilk.  Toss together 1.5c flour, .5c cornstarch, 1.5t baking powder, .25t baking soda, pinch salt, optional 1T sugar.Beat the eggwhites until stiff but not dry.Using a spatula quickly stir the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture, then quickly add the melted butter and stir until the batter is mostly smooth.  Fold in eggwhites.Make waffles",0
5977,"Fine Fiskar Scissors. These scissors work wonderfully.  I had two pairs of large scissors in my kitchen - one with a broken point and neither cut well.  Having used Fiskar scissors before outside my home and finding them great, I decided to buy two to replace my old ones.  The Fiskars not only cut smoothly, but since they are in the kitchen, they sometimes get sticky and dirty from opening packages of sauce, cutting tape, etc. These scissors have a coating on the blades that enable them to be cleaned easily with just a damp sponge, paper towel or brush and a drop of detergent, and they are like new.  No rusty hinges or screws that make cutting a chore like my old ones",0

Besides looking nice when hung from a pot rack, this big pot heats up quickly, cooks food effectively, allows for metal utensils to be used, and is simple to clean.

5979,"One-touch!. We received this model as a gift from dear friends -- after having cooked rice for decades in a covered saucepan on the range.  This is terrific!  Just put in the rice, salt and water, press down on the start button, and wait for the cook light to go off.  It takes about 20 minutes, just like on the range top, and produces perfect rice -- plus no more guessing, no more checking (and no more occasional overcooked rice as I must admit to when I used the old way in the past).",0
5980,"Great Looking / Functioning machine. got the machine about three weeks ago and have since made between 15 to 20 cafe lattes.  first and foremost the machine looks great - primary reason for purchase, as it definitely seemed a great visual piece in our kitchen.  I had read reviews and found nothing that scared me away functionality so went for it.  all in all thus far, we have no complaints.  it 'froth's' low fat milk using the steamer w/ ease and even does a good job w/ low fat soy milk which has to be a good test of a machines steaming capabilities.  the temp gage is great and fully functional.  I like simplicity (especially when it comes to anything requiring ac power) as it typically means less to break down.  the espressione is about as straight forward as can be.note* I have never owned an espresso machine before but used a krups one for about a year while living overseas in a family house.  the espressione is a total step up.  i have an obsessive attention to detail and couldn't find any corners cut w/ this device.  only module that they could have possibly been better w/ is the grounds tray which as listed in other reviews is a bit 'cheap plasticy'.  not a big issue as you can't even see it unless you remove it to clean out the grounds.

5986,"Great Juicer @ Times/Manual don't describe Trick of Cleaning. REVIEW:----------------- This Juicer is a Great juicer, and if you know the """"Trick"""" to cleaning it, well its a snap and makes this juicer a realy great Juicer.---------- First off, it is very quiet while juicing, and is juices very smoothly, no shimmying across counter top, like some customers have stated of other juicers. It does not foam up, and I have been able to juice over a gallon of juice, with only having having to spend 40 second to lift out baket, scoop out the pulp, and reassemble the juicer, before you are off again.-------- The citrus fruit juicer attachment, which is included at no extra cost, is well made with two sizes to juice large and small citrus fruit. It has safety features that will insure safe opperation while juicing citrus fruit, (some other brand juicers, will require you to purchase the juicer attachment at an additional price). The citrus fruit stainer is so great, you could can juice boxes of citrus fruit, while only having to stop and empty the citrus strainer after every about 30 medium peaces of citrus fruit.-------------------------------------For cleaning, it comes apart very quickly, without any difficulty, there is only two peices too take apart from the base unit.-----------------------------------------After spending many hours of researching the specs of different juicers out there. Then reading several customer reviews for many of the juicers sold by Amazon.com. I decided to purchase this KitchenAid Juicer.---------------------------------- And there was only one negative review concerning the KitchenAid Dual Function Juicer, about difficulty cleaning small food out of strainer, THERE IS A SIMPLE TRICK TO CLEANING!!! ------------------------------------ First off, the ""Shaped Spatula"", looks like part of the packing material, and was almost trashed, lucky I have always insisted, all packing materials are saved, and not put into the trash. Because if you loose this special shaped spatula, you might as well forget about cleaning this juicer.-----------------------------------TRICK TO CLEANING: Take the basket & the special designed spatula. Using the shorter size of the spatula scrap / scoop the left over fruit material out of the strainer basket.----------------------Then use the specially designed spatula's shorter side to scrap with on the outside of the basket. it will fit pefectly. Then put it under running water, and scrape the outside of the strainer basket, it will scrap off the the pulp that is stuck through the micro screen basket. As you turn the strainer and scrape under the running water, you will see how easyly the strainer basket is cleaned.................. Then repeat the process on the inside of the strainer basket while under runing water. Once you see the pulp clean from the strainer basket's inne sides. --------------- Then the next step is to cup your hand under the strainer, (vertical held), while the water is running. Since the pulp floats in water, the slight remaining pulp will float in the pool od water you have created, Then slightly tilt the stainer, and the floating pulp will float over the rim and out of your stainer. Leaving the strainer fairly clean. Repeat the prpocess as needed.---------------------------------------I am juicing 4-5 times each day, sometime as much as a gallon of juice at a time. It cleans quickly and juicer quickly and quietly. I am very happy with this product!!! I strongly recomend this item.Jef",0

So many of them complained of rough, soggy, chewy or bad-tasting popcorn.  My brother picked up one of these for the holidays, swung by the Fresh Market and got some very good/fresh gourmet popping corn.  Used some butter/oil topping and wow - it was unbelievably good!  I asked to borrower his popper to try at our house and stopped off at the grocery.  Grabbed some Orville Redenbaucher oil and corn.  Terrible.  Worst popcorn I had ever tried.  I went back to the grocery with the corn and returned it.  One of the managers mentioned that since the advent of microwave corn, the stores rarely move the old kernel-style corn.  Said that it could be literally years old, since there is no real shelf-life expiration.  I went to another whole foods type store, bought some organic ""black"" popping corn and used the same oil as before - fantastic!  Unfortunately I think this item is going to get panned on here by many users because the corn they are using in the popper is simply old.  Not sure where one would go to find it fresh other than maybe a boutique supermarket, but for what its worth, this product is great when used with great popcorn.
