0,"Great sturdy USB key ruined by U3. This is a great sturdy little USB key.Smooth edges will not scuff against clothes or anything else in your pocket.Handy keychain loop spaces out the USB key from the other stuff on your keychain, so it doesn't all bunch up and stick out.The USB connector is protected by a self-contained sheath, which slides easily, and sturdily locks into place when both fully retracted and fully exposed.As advertised, it's nearly uncrushable.  The case is made out of solid metal.  Only the sheath slider is plastic, and that's recessed, so it won't bear the weight of any crush.The USB key itself has a good speed when reading and writing data.The one, fatally bad, mistake that SanDisk made:U3!This piece of feculent malware infects all computers used with the USB key.  It stays around, even after the USB key has been removed.  It gets in the way of simply trying to use the USB key to hold data.  It's known to crash or lock up many computers.  It can't be formatted or deleted by normal means, as U3 appears to the computer as an additional drive letter that is strictly read-only.U3 can't be uninstalled unless fully installed in the first place, which means that it's easy to get stuck in limbo: neither fully installed, nor fully uninstalled, rendering the USB key unusable.  I wouldn't be surprised if they purposely make it difficult to uninstall.  Since U3 has the power to sneakily install software behind your back, whenever it is inserted, there's got to be a temptation for SanDisk to take some cash from a spammer or two.  Who wouldn't want the opportunity to silently install some spyware from an unsuspecting user's USB key?If you want to enjoy having a ""computer on a stick"", with applications and data entirely contained on the USB key, so you can always carry your favorite programs with you, you can get this right now, for free.  You don't need U3 at all.  It's at PortableApps.com -- enjoy!",1
1,didn't work for dell 700m. I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users.,1
2,Acronis Disk Director 10.0. Works great for partitioning a hard drive but when it comes to adding another operating system. I've been pulling out my hair. The directions are vague and the customer service stinks. Everything is done with email and if you want to talk to someone it will cost you 29.99 for a one time occurance. Check it out at www.acronis.com . Look around before you buy. If I would have I would have never had bought this product.,1
3,"If you like choppy. The quality of the recording was very bad. Little squares showed up all the time and in dramatic scene changes the whole screen was transitioning little squares, like it could just not keep up with the speed. I would defintely not buy it again.",1
4,"Nice style, poor function. I love the way this product looked. It was slim and sexy. The reality was that it was a battery hog, the media pad was basically useless, there were frequent bluetooth disconnections, and I actually had to return it once because the keys stopped working (I am not a gorilla typist). I eventually gave up on it. I give it 2 stars b/c it was a nice design, but it just didn't deliver",1
5,"Didn't work at all. Maybe mine was broken, but I don't think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends. I connected the splitter to my sound card, a TB Montego DDL, with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo. No signal whatever. Both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card. I even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad. Still no signal.I think you need to have either a very, very, strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one, or use a powered splitter.",1
6,"Boo for the SC101. As a computer dork, I wanted to get a little storage device for my home network.  5 hours after I began the ""10 minute"" process of getting the SC101 up and running...  and all I had to show for it was a lot of frustration and no working ""microSan.""  If you are dead-set on getting one of these, please make sure to read the netgear support pages thoroughly first as the description on the box seems wildly different than what is actually supported by the device",1
7,"Memorex (Forget it) Dysfunctional Software. Reads as Audio file (from a fresh disk.)Windows Media Pops up when disk is first inserted. Huh?Mis reads memory (states disk has 1.99 GB's without even being used yet.) What?Does not function for Backup source (Windows Me) Why Me?Does not format ...What?No matter which Memorex you use none of them work. I tried 3 versions of DVD+RWDisk played DVD R's from Verbatim but spit Memorex out like tobacco.This company never ceases to amaze me with the mistakes in their products from CD's to DVD's . You want to know the most popular brand on the shelf? Start by seeing the brand that's missing the most. If the shelf is over-stocked with Memorex, then it's pretty obvious people aren't buying them for a reason. Say your prayers, or buy a tent and camp outside of the store. Waste of money",1
8,"An expensive disaster. I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters.  Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands.  Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use.  Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions.  Don't waste your money",1
9,"Not worth it. As the title, it not worth the money at all even at such a low price. The picture quality is bad, very bad. I'd rather spend this money for other web-cam",1
10,"Not a quality item. This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap",1
11,"Sound is disappointing. I bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas. With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more",1
12,"P.O.S. I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman",1
13,"COBY lacks integrity. The cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic.The cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use. So I called Coby. They said I'd have to PAY THEM to send me a replacement! My advice, don't bother buying COBY",1
14,Tuner had major problems. I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed,1
15,"Poor usb performance. Buggy DVI switching. While it appears I finally have this switch mostly working, I have to say I'm very dissapointed in it's performance. IOGear's USB emulation for keyboard and mouse works very very poorly. With keyboard and mouse plugged into the correct keyboard/mouse usb ports I would continually have a slow/stuck keyboard along with really poor mouse behaviour. I can work around this by plugging my keyboard/mouse into the rear usb ports, thus bypassing the keyboard emulation. This works although you have to wait for all your usb devices to re-enumerate every time you switch computers.While my Mac PowerBook works fine with the DVI switch, my pc quite often has problems recognizing the DVI monitor when switching back to it. Unplugging and reconnecting the LCD's DVI connector into the switch seems to bring it back to life. No idea where the problem is, but I have a Dell 2001FP monitor, Windows XP SP2 with ATI Radeon 9800 (everything running latest drivers/firmware).How IOGear could have shipped a product this broken is beyond me. Unless they release a firmware update that fixes these problems I can only recommend people stay well away from this product",1
16,"Did not fit product advertised. This did not fit my Second generation ipod as advertised and I did not get any response about returning it, and of course I had to open the thing to find out it didn't fit",1
17,"Buy the Gamelink 400 instead. By purchasing this cable set, you are limiting your options.   You now must use your A/V receiver for sound whenever you play a game because you loose the analog sound connection you have with the 400 (the analog sound comes out of the same port as the video).  Spend the 10 dollars you save on an inexpensive optical cable and you now have the best of both worlds, you have the option of using the tv for sound OR the A/V receiver with the same quality video.   I will say that the video quality on my 62"" HDTV improved dramatically with the addition of the component (red, green, blue) video Gamelink 400 over the composite (one video cable) connection that comes with the PS2.  However if you're the kind of person who thinks the 450 MUST be better because it's a bigger number than the 400, it probably won't matter to you anyway..",1
18,"2.0 gb??? what are they talking about?. I started adding files to this card to use in my phone, but it has never shown more than 1 gb capacity even though it is printed 2.0 gb on the face. I have contacted Sandisk just earlier tonight to find out what is up with this card. So far I am more confused than pleased",1
19,"didn't work. so i buy my parents this brand new Canon mini-dvd camcorder for Christmas and look for some mini-dvds on amazon for them to record on.  i figure, what the heck, they don't need RW discs, but why not go for quality ones the first time around (as opposed to mini-dvd+r).  my parents are excited about this gift and we pop in the discs to start recording, but the thing can't read the discs for some reason.  i read the back of the dvd package and it says some formatting may be required.  so i pop the disc into my computer and try to format it, but my computer can't read the discs as well.  i just bought some mini dvd-R's and my parents will be getting it soon.  i'm pretty sure the camcorder itself wasn't the problem, but if it turns out to be the case, i'll re-evaluate this product.  but for now, it's no good.",1
20,"Awful Product. I picked one of these up from the Apple store and used it that day. Not only does the product not broadcast well (I had to hold it two feet from my radio, it didn't even get a signal in the car on any frequency) but it dosent stay in the dock connector. The transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the iPod. The transmitter also appears to turn off after 5 seconds of not touching the buttons. The LCD screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on. Because it worked so poorly I couldn't tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken. An indicator saying whether the transmitter was on or off would be helpful and not a huge battery drain.If you want a knockoff transmitter that works only when placed perfectly next to your radio than get this. If you want something that works consider the iTrip by Griffin",1
21,"DO NOT BUY!!!!. These speakers crackle horribly!!!  I sent them back & had new ones sent to me 3 TIMES, and they were ALL like that!!!  It is a cool product, toobad they don't work!!!",1
22,"2 Way Radio NOT up to 17 mile range. We bought these units specifically to take on a cruise ship.  There was not one minute on any of the many channels that we did not experience interference, pick up other 2-way users, or had no signal at all.  We were so dissatisfied that we returned them to Amazon for refund",1
23,"Bad Reviews But I Bought It Anyway. I read all the review I could find on this product and most were bad.  A few recent ones were better.  The first problem I encountered was the power on button did not function correctly.  I had to press, press harder, shake the device, and finally turn it upside down while pressing to power it on.  I was never able to power it down with the on/off button.  The wireless AP worked fine but it would not function with an ethernet cable.  I thought it was me (though I've unboxed and setup 25+ wireless, wire only, routers, swithes, etc. without problems.  After several hours of trying different approaches I looked at documentation, knowledge base articles and found one that indicated if the device power light blinked continuously the device was defective.  That was the end of it and I returned it for credit.   I do not recommend this device to anyone.T. Ragan - Cypress, T",1
24,"Not the Best MP3 Player in the World. I went to Circuit City with my dad to buy this MP3 player after my older sister recieved one for Christmas. When I was researching the quality of this product, some of the reviews were not pleasing, but I'm sorry to say I actually went out and bought it. And I'm also sorry to say this review will not be very pleasing either. The exterior casing of the Creative Zen Nano Plus is merely cheap plastic -- flimsy and pathetic next to the iPod nano 2nd Generation's aluminum casing. Scratch marks and scuff marks show up easily and I'm guessing that the curved part that comes off to allow you to change the battery would also break easily if stepped on, etc. The positively worst part of this MP3 player are the earbuds, which fall out if you barely touch the wiring. In order to keep the earbuds in place I have to stick them into my ears at an odd angle which makes even Sound Level 1 too loud to hear someone speak in an ""indoor voice"". Sadly, there's more: the backlight doesn't stay on long enough to allow you light to see which song is playing, how long it's been playing, etc. There is a ""backlight"" section in the ""Settings"", but the longest it can stay illuminated is only 15 seconds. Also, when skipping tracks, you use the same button to scan within a song, making it much harder to scan within the song than skip tracks. Another disappointment is that two of the CDs I tried to load onto this MP3 player weren't read as ""being there"", although they work fine when I listen to them on my WalkMan, DVD player, computer, etc. Luckily, I've had this player for about nine months, but it's still going strong, most likely because of the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery. This does get most annoying after awhile though, having to change batteries every two to three weeks, or whatever, depending on how often you listen to this. From the reviews on  this site, I'm most likely going to purchase an iPod nano 2 GB for my next Christmas. So although it's around $90 more, I'm hoping it'll be worth the extra money to have an MP3 player I'm not complaining about all the time",1
25,"Noise maker. One month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine. My car's engine sounds better. Don't waste your money. I called Sharp and they say is the fan. Great, maybe I should remove it and use ice cubes",1
26,"Adapter, but no cable. Note that this product includes only the AC adapter but no additonal cabling to attach to the Zune.  So if you were thinking about having one cable to hook to your PC and another to charge if you are away from you PC, remember to take the Zune cable with you. For $29.95 I expected them to include the 25 cent cable",1
27,not worth the money. It made little notable difference or improvement.I would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious.,1
28,"These tape cassettes get eaten by the labeller. I have had so many of these cassettes get eaten by the labelmaker that I will not use this machine or these cassettes anymore.  Once the machine starts to eat the tape, there is no repair; the whole cassette is ruined.  I have had new tapes get ruined practically right away.  I am through with Brother labelling products.  This is the second Brother labelmaker that I have had that has done this.  These cassettes are so expensive, and then so many get ruined",1
29,"TV OK, SERVICE FROM AMAZON BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!. Buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the TV you will be left on your own to sort it out. Amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company, but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email (run around)!! Bare that in mind before making any large purchase, may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back",1
30,"Don't waste your money!. We purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house. With all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft. At first it worked like a charm, but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason. We take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working. Then last week I added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke. Useless!!!",1
31,"Destroyed my CD--I wanna give this product  minus 5 stars. Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the ""repair"" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?",1
32,"The APC damaged equipment warrantee is worthless..... I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products.My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC.NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless",1
33,"RIP-OFF: Doesn't advertise that you need an AC adaptor. I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice",1
34,"This is junk and it doesn't last 9 months. I got this for Christmas last year.  I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort.  I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I.  Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop.  Save your money and buy something else.Take your time and read through the ""cotton candy"" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced",1
35,"Out of service for 2 months. I bought this Samsung model in September because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction.  It went black the day before the Super Bowl.  It is now NCAA playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced. The service technician has tried 3 times to repair, now having replaced every component.  I am finally on a replacement list with no ETA.  The Samsung Customer Service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned.  The repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push Samsung - with no success",1
36,"Short and broken. The retractable mechanism works well and the cable is compact, but this cable is pretty much useless as a travel CAT5 cable.First of all it's too short. In about half of the hotels where I needed to use it, the network jack was at least a couple of feet further away than the reach of this cable.Second (and more importantly) it's not robust enough. After a year or so of light use a wire inside got broken somehow, and today I had to go in search of a regular CAT5 cable. On the outside there seems to be no damage to the wire.In short, it's one of those purchases that I regret enough to write a negative review.",1
37,"Disappointed. This cartridge does NOT fit my HP 648c as advertised. The color cartridge that accompanied it did, however",1
38,"There are better KVM solutions. Besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned, Belkin support is horrible. The automated system consistenly disconnects the call, requiring going through their operator. My 4-port KVM stopped functioning after six months. There's no information on the web to help either. It's as if there IS no way to fix a KVM that doesn't work. Flash upgrading is a joke. I followed the procedure directly from Belkin's website. So I had to RMA replace it. Trust me, Belkin doesn't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall. Go with IOGEAR - they include all the cables with the KVM switch for the price of Belkin's without cables",1
39,"Died after one year- fuser problem. Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing. Showed it to a repair shop, says the fuser is a toast. Replacement cost part and labor $300. Died just after one year so have to bear the expense. Poor design/quality. Beware, i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem",1
40,"Disappointed, but keeping it. I am a bit disappointed with this DVD player.  I had a Pioneer DV-C505 standard DVD player (not progressive). I recently purchased a 42"" LCD and wanted a player that was progressive and upscaling to 1080i.I connected my old Pioneer (non-progressive) player and watched movies the 1st weekend. DVD's DVD-R's etc.  I was surprised that the newer DVD's in 16:9 looked pretty good.I expected to see an improvement in color or resolution with the Sony DVP-NC85H.  However, I can't see any difference whatsoever in quality of image as displayed on my 42"" LCD.I ran the old DVD player with very cheap component cables straight to the LCD TV. I ran the new Sony DVP-NC85H straight to the LCD TV with HDMI. I got the blue HDMI working light and sound and image are transferred to the screen/LCD TV, but the quality is no better than my old Pioneer (non-progressive) player.  Did I do something wrong?  I can't see any color or resolution improvement.I may return this since it also introduced an 'echo' issue that is acknowledged in the Sony manual. The echo issue is between the HDMI sound transferred to the TV and the digital coax sound delivered via my receiver. With the old DVD player, no echo and excellent 5.1 sound from the TV and my receiver (simultaneous). The Sony manual states clearly that if you output via the HDMI, you cannot tune out any echo created by optical or coax digital DTS or Dolby Digital output.  The manual says to output the signal via PCM. However, that still introduces echo that cannot be removed.Maybe I am doing something wrong, but this player is definitely not an improvement over a standard, non-progressive player in my opinion.I thought maybe it was just the new LCD TV, but it displays excellent HD quality via HDMI input from my local cable companies digital tuner/DVR box.What are you guys comparing the supposed good quality on this player to?Update:I went back and tried comparing my old DVD player with this new Sony even more. I was able to change some of the settings in just the right combination on the Sony that improved the image. For the YCaCr/RGB setting, I tried RGB instead which got rid of lots of the red blocky imagery. I set the sharpness to 1 and the BNR on.  These 3 settings improved the image to the level where I will not return this DVD player.I still challenge someone from Sony to look at the image from my non-progressive DVD player (480i) and tell me how the 1080i (upscale) out of this unit is significantly better. Even looking at it 6"" from the screen. Honestly, I could pick out the pores on James Bonds face with the non-progressive 480i player, so maybe it is just really good, and the Sony just doesn't shine as much due to that.The echo is better or worse depending on the DVD played. I have been asking friends with HD setups and they commented that echo is a problem with a lot of setups. TV sound is not usually used even as a center, I guess.Reading the comments here helped me a lot.  Especially comments regarding the feedback on the TV for what grade of signal the TV is seeing. Mine display reports 1080i with the Sony connected, 480i with my old DVD player connected, as expected. I hadn't realized I could pull that up.I would give the Sony a 4 for features(Divx playback, SACD, etc)and a 3 for picture output for an average of 3.5, but the 1-5 scale entry above is frozen now in edit mode.Also, I had reservations about non-shuffle, disk-to-disk abilities on this DVD player.  You can shuffle on one DVD/CD, but not between 1-5. I plan on working around that by playing MP3 disks for parties, Xmas, etc where I need the shuffle capability.  Incidentally, I like loading my DVD player up with multiple DVD's for an evenings viewing, or just leave some favorites in. Some movies are 2 disk and I have not tested that it'll shuffle to the next disk when the 1st runs out, but I expect it",1
41,Not for everyone. Must have firewire AC wall charger and/or six-pin firewire on computer to charge this unit.  I have neither.Also found 30g vidpod didn't fit properly in plastic sleeves and the dock connector seemed to want to unseat it as well.Returned unit to shop and purchased Belkin 4 x AA battery unit with suction cups.  Much better.  You can use rechargeable batteries or simply buy them when needed,1

43,"Far too overpriced for this length!! You shouldn't spend more than $10. Much like the previous reviewer I urge you not to spend lots of money on HDMI cables. HDMI specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost, therefore there is no reason, no matter what the cable is made of, to spend money on HDMI cables.Search the internet, you can find plenty of good 10ft HDMI cables for $10 or less.Digital is zeroes and ones. In HDMI's case, either the cable is connected or it isn't",1
44,"Battery life isn't all that. The old phone I had was heavy, and the battery life was horrible. You have to put this phone on the charger every night or you won't have a phone in the morning even if you don't use it that much.

I have been very careful with how I store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from USB ports. Regardless, the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top, and the bottom corners of the plastic shell (that go into a USB port) have started snapping off in little chunks",1

55,"Disappointing. I just received it today, and will be returning it tomorrow.  Here's what I found:1) On my unit, switching channels, pausing a program, or switching unputs caused my TV to lose the HDMI signal for 2-3 seconds.  When the original source was digital or component video, the screen would just be black during this time, but on analog inputs the screen would go bright green, then flash between green & the analog data for a second before finally becoming stable.  Given that we often channel surf using our VCR, this was unacceptable.2) For some reason it messes up the HDMI signal coming in from my Comcast DVR.  When I run the HDMI cable directly from the DVR to my TV, I am able to permanently set my TV to 16:9 aspect ratio when using the HDMI input, and all programs come out looking OK- the TV will put black bars on the side of 4:3 aspect ratio programs on non-HD channels.  However, running the HDMI signal through the receiver meant that ALL shows were displayed in widescreen- the TV was no longer able to figure out which shows should be in 4:3 and which should be in 16:9.3) As others have mentioned, you can only use Zone 2 speakers with analog inputs, which on my system means you can't listen to CD's, since I use a digital input.  And the Zone 2 controls are really difficult to use.",1

Although aware of the unreliability of a single review, I decided to gave it a shot, and paid $10 for shipping--no other way since it's sold through a third party. $28 later, I was holding the biggest $#!* I've seen in a while! The construction feels very cheap, and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3-year old. And the worst of all, only one of the two microphones worked. Even the one that works is horrible--the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic. It uses a 9-volt battery in each of the two mics, and that's another 5 bucks out of my pocket. You know what?  I'll probably have to eat the $33, since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns. Well, I learned a lesson...things are cheap for a reason",1

The LED on the device and the VU's on the software interface say it's working but it will not output to the sound card. So I wrote M-Audio and asked for their help.Their answer was that since I was operating XP Media Center Edition operating system, it will not support two sound devices and they could not help me. Unless I get another version of XP, they could not help me at all. They basically told me to bug off because I'm using XP MCE. Nowhere on the box does it say that it is not compatible with XP MCE. In fact, it just says the minimum requirement is XP with service pack 2, period. To me that is false advertising.I tried to take it back where I bought it but they would not take it because it has software and I (of course) opened and installed it! So then, I was stuck with a useless box. I finally did get it to work, sort of. I took the line output from the box and plugged it into the line input of my sound card. However, it has no fidelity, sounds terrible, and the sound effects software that came with the box will not work.One other note. When I tried to take it back to the music store and told them I was using XP Media Center Edition, the guy laughed and waved his arm at the wall of sound devices and said that none of them will work with XP Media Center Edition! He says it is really a licensing issue with Microsoft. Then I found out you cannot upgrade MCE to XP Professional!

Out of the box, this pseudo-entertainment center rocked and did everything it was supposed to, but about a month into the purchase loomed a very ugly problem. Cut to the chase, this product is horrible. If it's not suffering from one malfunction it will invent another. I've had so many ""corrupt files"" that I might blow my brains out. For whatever reason, this device likes to shut down in the middle of transferring to and from the computer, making it impossible to get a whole song on, much less a whole album.Ah, but it gets worse. You only think it's working when all of a sudden it just freezes! Why? I have no clue! It takes forever to load all my songs because it uses a hard drive, it takes forever to find a song because the hard drive slows down when you try to file through 3000 songs, and it takes forever to get used to the HORRIBLE buttons on the side. Half the time I press the wrong button and then my song ends and I can't get the hard drive to load it back up! It drives me absolutely crazy!Besides the horrible layout of the buttons, the speaker is next to worthless; if you crank up the volume all the way the speaker fizzles and gives you a horrible mess of a noise.The only good thing is that the clarity of the screen is fantastic. It makes my images look crystal clear and my HD videos look as good as my HDTV. That is, if you can get the confounded thing to actually play my videos. Maybe I got a dud and I haven't tried contacting Archos, but I will asap. I thought I should let everyone know to stay away from this product as I know there are many others out there just like it. I even bought the DVR station (which is cool and would be perfect if the actual Archos would work) but I cannot say I'm pleased in any way with my purchase. I just hope I get some refund for this",1

69,"Apple IR Remote for iPod Video (5th Gen). The deficiencies of this Remote with the new iPod Video (5th Gen) are serious. In order to use this Remote you must have or purchase the Universal Dock for an additional $40. Not only is its capability seriously flawed (e.g.  the Menu button is non-functional with the iPod; you can only adjust volume, go forward, go back, pause and resume play). When using it for slideshows and videos, you must do all of the pre-show set-ups first (using the Photo Settings or Video Settings menus, directly on the iPod and even start the slideshow or video. THEN and only THEN, can you assume limited control with the Remote. BUT, if you inadvertently push the Remote's Play/Pause button at the beginning of the show, the iPod will revert to the music playlist function and you will have your slideshow playing, not with the music you selected in the set-up, but with the music from the Music menu playlist last selected. The only recourse is to go to the iPod and reprogram the Photo or Video Settings and restart the show from the beginning. Once the last picture is seen, you must then go back to the iPod to STOP the show (otherwise the music will continue to play and the show will loop and restart). Not only is this a poor purchase choice, at any price, it is the only solution because the ultimate problem lies with the iPod software which can provide no additional functions no matter what brand of Remote you buy. This is a problem that only Apple can fix",1
70,"Usually like Panasonic... but not this one. Bought this phone a few months ago to replace old cordless Panasonic 2.4 GHz that died.  This is probably the worst phone I've ever owned.Several reasons:1)  The range is WORSE than the 2.4 GHz I had!  I used to be able to get great reception in every room of my large one-level home and in my big yard.  Now I can only venture about 3/4 of the distance I could before... and then the connection starts to break up.  And I've given up taking it outside.2)  The ""voice enhancer"" is useless.  It doesn't work.  The sound is worse than just leaving it in normal mode.3)  Love the speaker-phone feature in the handset, but it doesn't work when you have it sitting in the recharger/base.  (Dumb!)  It'd be nice when the battery gets really low to be able to use the speaker phone while it charges.  But nope... if you run out of charge, the phone is useless until it recharges again.4)  I still can't figure out the phone's weird caller-ID inconsistency.  Sometimes it doesn't register incoming calls at all... and worse, it doesn't register all missed calls so I can contact people who may not have left a message.  And instead of listing each ID in the order it came in, especially duplicate callers, it'll just put a check mark by a recently called entry... so you know that person called more than once, but you don't know when.  Yeah, if people leave messages every time they call, this wouldn't be a problem... but you know they don't.I'm usually not hard to please, but I'm looking now to replace this phone that is fairly new.",1

I own a number of BOSE products and needless to say that this piece of equipment very much lived up to my expectations of a BOSE system - for the first 8 weeks!After 8 weeks of blissful enjoyment, the honeymoon was over! First, one of the speakers stopped working. BOSE asked us to return the speaker for replacement - which we did - leaving us with only 1 working speaker for 3 weeks.Following this replacement, another 3 months passed before the second original speaker followed the same fate as the 1st! Again, we were asked to return the faulty speaker for replacement. 4 weeks passed and the replacement speaker arrived - unfornately it was the wrong make and model! BOSE were somewhat apologetic and sent us the correct speaker 2 weeks later.A further 4 months of enjoyment followed before the base unit started to falfunction. BOSE suggested fixing our faulty unit, but after a protracted phone argument, they agreed to replace the entire system at my request! I was asked to pay for the $60 return postage to BOSE for the faulty system and again, another 4 week wait followed awaiting the replacement.The upshot of all of the above is that I have been able to enjoy my system in full working order for 7 months since purchase 10 months ago, I have had to make 3 factory returns for replacement & exchange and the whole ordeal has cost me $60! Genuinely superb customer service.At this point it is worth pointing out that not a single person from BOSE has ever been sympathic with my plight and I have been offered no compensation for my trouble - and why should they - I am a but one small customer whereas they are a huge multinational corporation!?!Having just received my replacement system I am understandably keeping my fingers crossed this time although my confidence levels with the product are at an all time low.Buy at your peril - you have been warned",1

78,"disappointing. Bought the DRX-830U to replace an internal LG burner that gave out after about 6 months of fairly regular use.  Have previously had an IOMagic internal that gave out after about 5 months and a Sony 500-series external that still works fine after over 3 years, albeit at 4x max w/no DL capability.  I chose the new Sony because of the longevity of older one vs my other models, plus I only paid $70 for it at a major electronics store (on sale).Installation went fine.  Plugged in the cables, turned it on and Win XP automatically loaded software for it.  After a required restart I burned by 1st DVD (Sony 16x -R single-layer disk) using Nero Express and was disappointed at the 10+ minute burn time.  Took over 3 minutes for the unit to spin up and down over and over before actually starting to write.  Also noticed that the unit was considerably louder than my previous 3 burners.Went to Sony support site, downloaded latest firmware update (SS22) and installed it (unit came with SS20).  Install went fine, just be warned that it automatically initiates a Windows shutdown upon completion.  No option to delay it.Burned the same data to new disk and was surprised to find that, even though write process started much more quickly, total burn time increased to over 12 minutes.  I immediately tried burning same data one more time.  The burn failed after about 4 minutes with just a 'write error' showing up in the log.  When I ejected the disk, it was very warm to the touch and I caught a faint whiff of burning silicon(!).  I waited a while before trying again, burned the same data one more time, and everything went fine with a burn time of just over 8 minutes.  Immediately went to burn another disk of new data and had another failure after about 4 minutes.  Disk was again very warm.  Tried again immediately afterwards - same result.Upgraded Nero to latest versions, just to be safe.  First burn went ok, a little over 9 minutes, next burn immediately afterwards failed.  Faint smell of burning silicon again.Since then I've burned several disks successfully, but burn times have ranged from 8 to over 15 minutes.  I now always wait at least 30 minutes bt burns to let the unit cool off.Overall, the excessive heat and noise, along with the varied burn times, leaves me disappointed with this unit.Maybe I just got a lemon",1

I took the battery out of the phone, then sprayed the keys and talk button in front with 409 Orange Power.  I really doused it good.

New homes break up room/equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this.

Each Delphi product had to be returned because of problems; sound card problem, antenna connection would not maintain contact with signal, etc. The sound was very good when the systems were working. The purpose of buying the portable units was to use the SkyFi2 outside of the home. I gave up on the portable systems and now have the home kit for SkyFi2 connection to my home stereo system. So far so good. I have had it hooked-up and working one week.",1

Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate.",1

The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements.  I would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612C black replacement cartridge C6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660C other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case,1

Yes, restoring images from the card to computer is very fast compared to my 12x card. But while snapping photos there is no difference in speed.

114,expensive mistake. I agree with the other bad reviews above.One faviourable reviewer uses it for pool areobics which I assume dosnt involve submurging your head. The other faviourable reviewer who lane swims with it dosnt state his/her sex but I can only assume this reviewer is a woman who swims with her head above water (as many women do to protect their hair).I can only agree with the other reviewers who swim with it. The sound is already muffled and those things you stick in your ear (can be painful as you have to really shove them in)let the water in no matter how hard you try to plug them in your ear so after a few metres the sound is almost completely blocked rendering them useless.I also had the problem with the headphones though when I got a replacement pair with the lubricant there was no mention that I needed to use the lubricant to rectify that particular problem.Another review elsewhere mentioned you could try cutting back the plugs to suit your ears but I really cant see that this would help much.If someone out there does have this product and is using it sucessfully while submurged please write a review here and tell us what the rest of us are doing wrong but until then my advice to anyone wanting this for swimming with your head in the water is ...dont bother,1

116,"Good idea, design a little weird, and bad sound. When you look at a picture of the Sony MDR-J10 headphones, you probably think ""great idea!"" I certainly did, and I thought they'd be the answer to my annoyances with earbuds falling out while I run.Well, that's partly true. The over-ear design is ingenious, and there's no slippage whatsoever, which is refreshing. But the design is also its most major flaw: most headphone speakers which project directly into your inner ear, but the placement of the speakers on this set is such that they face forward into the tragus (the projection of cartilage that sticks out from your ear), which means that the sound is inherently distorted. You can adjust the placement somewhat but, to me, it feels like I'm simply choosing the less annoying variation on distorted sound.What's more, the overall sound was a bit tinny and weak for my tastes. I realize these are very inexpensive headphones, but even for running, I can't cope with such thin-sounding music.After trying these, I switched back to the earbuds I already owned and found it less annoying that they fell out occasionally -- after all, they sound great when they do stay in, which is more than I can say for the Sony MDR-J10 headphones.",1
117,"This is junk and it doesn't last 9 months. I got this for Christmas last year.  I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it.

Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop.  Save your money and buy something else.Take your time and read through the ""cotton candy"" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced",1

If this is the case, this D*Link product is a waste of time. Despite being advertised as an Access Point (AP), the DWL-G700AP is not a true AP.There is no client AP mode (allows the AP to be a client to another AP), there is no wireless bridge mode, there is no wireless repeater mode. In fact, everything you would expect to see on an AP is missing. And D*link do not seem to be able to keep track of firmware releases properly either. My AP came with 1.03 which, according to D*Link does not exist.As such, it's virtually useless as anything other than a VERY basic access point. Buy the Linksys WAP54G instead and get a real AP",1

121,"serious drop in quality. I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are ""user-friendly"".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture.First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap ""watered down"" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well.I bought a yellow ""psyc"" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all.I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them.",1

Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I'd have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage.

Magellan charged me $126 to have it repaired.I ordered the Explorist XL as an upgrade and for use as my primary unit with the intention of keeping the Meridian Gold as a backup. But I returned the Explorist after learning how difficult it is to use with the MapSend Direct Route map software. Also, the map software will only work with one Magellan GPS receiver at a time. So, you either have to completely uninstall and reinstall it each time you want to use a different GPS unit - or you have to buy another copy of the software and install it on a different computer. I don't mind paying for a second copy of the software, but who wants to buy another computer!Until Magellan addresses these issues, I recommend buying something else",1

After power was restored, the VCR and XBox would not power up. Everything else connected to the 880 worked fine. I had my VCR and XBox checked out and both were fried by the power surge. I submitted a warranty to CyberPower and got a new 880 in the mail immediately. The warranty process was very smooth and very quick. CyberPower paid me 50% of what I originally paid for the VCR and XBox. Their warranty clearly states that they will only pay fair market value of the damaged equipment.On one hand, I can't recommend CyberPower because I got a defective surge suppressor. But on the other hand, the warranty claim process was pretty smooth. I was lucky I kept the receipts for the 880, my VCR, and my XBox. I definitely wouldn't recommend connecting your most valuable electronics with this surge suppressor. You should consider a UPS even if it's just for surge suppression.

137,"If This Is Intended For BitTorrent Purposes, Save Your Money. Ever wonder how many Amazon product reviews are submitted by corporate shills?  In the case of the DGL-4100, I'm ready to guess it's about 85%.Okay, I'm not totally serious serious in that estimate.  I'm just disappointed in the product.I'm not a gamer, and perhaps that's why the DGL-4100 didn't work for me.  I like to download tv programs via BitTorrent.  I download whole seasons at a time, which runs into the multiple Gigabytes.  As you other BitTorrent enthusiasts may know, the average home network router has a tendency to freeze when BT pulls too many connections through it.  I find it very depressing to get up in the morning (or come home from work) and find that my downloads stopped short many hours ago.For some months now I've been in search of an affordable router to avoid this problem.  Considering what I've spent so far, perhaps I would've been better off to buy something expensive and capacious from the start.In any case, it's difficult to derive any sort of consensus about router efficacy from the Web.  There probably are more than a few lying corporate shills floating around cyberspace, but mostly there are well-meaning people who report good or bad results without taking into account operating system, exact router model, broadband type, BitTorrent client, or the size of the torrents they download.I was mildly excited to find so many positive Amazon reviews for the DGL-4100.  Perhaps, I thought, a router built for high-performance gaming would account for connection issues similar to BitTorrent's.  Right about now, the cognescenti reading this little tale of woe are probably laughing their butts off.Let me cut to the chase here.  After I hooked up the DGL-4100 and started two BT downloads (one a mere 1.5 G, the other 22 G), everything looked fine... for about three hours.  Then the silly thing froze on me, as happened with the Linksys and Netgear routers (wired and wireless) I've tried.  I obtained the latest firmware for it (January 11, 2006), installed this, and tried again.  The results were similar, except that now I noticed the router freezing on me even during BT-free Web-surfing.  Regardless of my BitTorrent client (Azureus, uTorrent, BitComet)or its settings, the results didn't improve.If you're a gamer, maybe you'll roll the dice on the DGL-4100.  If you're a BitTorrent enthusiastic such as myself, you should probably keep looking",1

I'm beginning to wonder if the TV is somehow the cause of this recurring problem.  The main channel Up-Down buttons no longer work, so one cannot scan channels.  The individual channel and PIP button still work, but only one of the PIP scan buttons function.  The only way to surf is to bring up the PIP window, use the lone PIP scan button, then punch in each channel one wants to watch.I have a Universal MX500 for the main TV, and have had no problems whatsoever with it.

143,"Deceptive marketing at its finest. The one and only reason I purchased this label printer was for the highly touted Dymo Stamps feature, supposedly giving you the ability to print your own postage stamps onto thermal postage labels for no monthly fee, only the cost of the printer and the thermal label refills.  According to the Dymo Stamps website, Dymo Stamps gives you the ability to ""Print Exactly the Amount of Postage you Need"" and ""Eliminate the Need for Costly Postal Meters.""  What the consumer is not told upfront is that these ""precise"" amounts of postage can only be in denominations of the Dymo Stamps software's choosing, not any amount you want.  In fact, the only postage denominations that can be printed are those already available in stamp form at the post office, basically just your run-of-the-mill $0.39 stamps, $4.05 Priority Mail stamps, and postcard stamps.  This software also does not give you the capability to print postage for Parcel Post, Media Mail, or Express Mail, and doesn't allow you to add additional postage for services like insurance or certified mail at all.  How this saves you any trouble over buying stamps from the post office is beyond me.  Conveniently, you can only overcome all of these limitations by subscribing to Endicia (Dymo Stamps' backbone provider) for a monthly fee.  Heck, you can't even go to an office supply store to buy the thermal postage label refills that you need to print postage on; they can only be ordered online through a link in the Dymo Stamps software.  Especially given the fact that even the least expensive Dymo Stamps capable LabelWriter model is over $100, this will NOT save you any money in postage, will NOT save you any time, and ordering stamps online from USPS (or getting them from the local post office) is just as convenient, if not more convenient, than ordering the stupid thermal refills online from Dymo and waiting for them to arrive.

For the life of me, I just couldn't get the Graphire4 working on my Mac at all. The installer crashed (Kernal panic!) my otherwise rock solid Tiger installation. Downloading the latest driver from Wacom's web site was only marginally useful; the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how I adjusted the control panel, and even moderately fast motion caused it to ""submarine"" from one side of the screen to the other. Wacom's sparse FAQ suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit, and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away. It didn't work, and besides, I have no plans use the tablet from across the room.Phone support was no better: Wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff July 3rd off!

I mean place and use the device like it was my trusty AAA map.- Support does not read bug reports (I want that job with zero accountability please!)Does it work? Yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map.  It does take some time to find its GPS often, but its tolerable. It manages to lose signal with tree cover (seriously, I can still see the sky).Moral of this review: verify with an online map service BEFORE driving to unknown places.  Defeats the prupose? No.  TomTom Go 300 did find my way around some detours in NJ near Trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration (the prupose of this device).Updates:After using TomTom Go 300 for a few months I have seen more problems than I care for.  I have recommended everyone in my family to not buy TomTom products.  The map for my area, King of Prussia, PA more than two years out of date.  It got my dad lost going to a hotel which is 1.3 miles away from me.In some areas, you will fall off the map.  The most annoying new feature is TomTom alterate route functions.  I am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere.  TomTom wants me to take the ""long"" way to my destination by switching from the State Route (meaning Route 1 or Route 66) that I'm on to the another State Route at the fork.  The thing is, if I tell it not to take the other State Route, the damn device will tell me to turn around!!  Once I pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around.  When I choose to re-run the routing software from where I am, it figures out a new route completely passing the road that I need to take.  The road is on the TomTom map, but it won't take it until I get on to it.  WHAT GIVES?Bug Report submitted to TomTom-------TomTom Go 300 v6.150The mapping engine is BROKEN.  It cannot handle a road that is broken into several non-contiguous sections.  The city, Pennsauken, gave several distinct streets the SAME name!Destination:3401 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109If you map the destination on any Internet site and scroll around, you would see that:[...]All points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road.  They are on different roads by the same name in the same city.The TomTomGo 300's map actually has these locations on it, but is UNABLE to map to anything but the first OCCURANCE of Cooper Ave: 7200 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109Trying to find the intersection (cross street) of two streets Cooper Ave and Park Ave does not work even though the TomTom's map clearly shows that they do intersect.  TomTom can only see the intersection of Cooper Ave and Derousse Ave.That area has several other streets, Sherman Ave for example, that are also non-contiguous",1
149,*Buyers Beware*! Check your camera model before you buy this. These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality.I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !!Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !,1
150,"Don't buy the PSUS4. I've a PSUS4 for over two years now. I'm awaiting the return of a forth replacement unit from Linksys. They stream my LAN and kill connections. Linksys tried to claim the warranty was one year even though the .PDF on their web site states three years. When I cross shipped the last return, they charged my credit card early and then took forever to refund the money. Now, they claim the unit is on back order for over six weeks already. This is the last Linksys component in my LAN. I've replaced every other device with other brands. Linksys stinks",1
151,"Great looking case design, lousy implementation... The Netgear SC101 Storage Central device holds a lot of promise and offers a nice looking case design. In fact, I referred to mine as a ""network toaster"" since that is kind of what it looked like.Unfortunately, ""beauty is only skin deep"" when it comes to this unit.Netgear did get some things right--the ability to buy just the enclosure and add your own hard disks is great. Anyone who has worked on computers for some time will undoubtedly have some perfectly serviceable hard drives sitting around. This unit gives you the ability to put at least some of those drives to use.Installation and use of the device--when it works, which it doesn't always do--are both easy and definitely geared to new and inexperienced computer users who just want something that works.What Netgear missed with this device, however, is the ability for more advanced users (or people who have multiple computers with different operating systems) to take this device further. It offers no web based interface and no file sharing protocols outside of the proprietary software (for Windows 2000/XP only). This is a serious flaw to an otherwise great idea.The hard drives are also loose inside the device when you install them. There's nothing to hold them in place or keep them stable other than some blocks of foam. I could see this leading to electrical shorting from the circuit board on the drive to the case and even serious disk damage in the event that this unit would fall. The interior of the case is also quite sharp, so watch out not to cut or slice yourself while installing drives (or taking it apart to see what's inside).All things and limitations considered, I returned mine after five minutes of using it. It's just too limited for the power user, hobbyist or tinkerer. If you pay full retail price (~$100), it's also quite pricey for such a limited piece of hardware. If Netgear were to come out with a more powerful version that offered true network attached storage functionality, I'd certainly give serious thought to buying it. As it is right now, the product was an expensive disappointment to me",1
152,"If only the wireless part of it worked!. I' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht I picked up a few urs  Don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors.  That's the kyboard, nome!!

According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!!I type for hours on end per day and have been typing ""properly"" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!)No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it!Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.

157,"Good TV for the price - MORONIC remote. I purchased my 6620LDG, like other reviewers, to replace my old kitchen TV.  I really wanted an LCD with a built-in DVD player.  While I like the TV just fine, the remote is another story.  I actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful.  Included in my e.mail was the following:""While I find the overall TV to be good, I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model. I simply can't believe that a name brand likeSylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher-end TV.""""...this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate. It is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes, and what makes them comfortable.""""Seriously. I cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it's public distribution, but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable.""""A remote should be, at the very least,functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed, dont you think???? Aside from the horrid shape, size and weight of the remote, this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes. I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no ""last channel"" button. Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts?""""I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years. Since the remote is so huge, how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms. They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons, and amongst other issues, the remote is frustrating because: 1. The text is illegible, 2. The buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and 3. When you channel surf, the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. In fact, if I can find a universal remote that works with this TV; I intend to do just that. Of course, to add insult to injury, it states clearly in your owners manual that 'We do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls. Not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control.' Great, so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your TV, but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your TV uncooperative with them. This is thefirst time that I have encountered this too, BTW.""Finally:""I hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the 6620LDG LCD TV/DVD combo TV. I expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it.""THIS was their entire response:""Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product.  Your comments and opinions are important to us.  Please understand that it is our objective to provide the best possible product.  We hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product.""I am on the verge of taking this back because of the remote",1

It's not that damp in there, but the switch just died on me.I'd question the power supply or some other factor but my router and DSL modem have never had any problems at all and this is the second Netgear switch I've owned that has gone kaput; my best guess is dampness",1
165,"Nice user interface but not reliable. Palms have nice user interfaces. This is my second Palm PDA. The screen is excellent, and it is thin and light. The software works well, and synchronizes without problems to Windows XP Home and XP Professional. Unfortunately, after two years the on-off switch has failed. This requires me to use one of the ""hot"" buttons to turn it on. This allows me to continue to use this device, but it is annoying and inconvenient (these are all about convenience, right?). My first Palm device, an M130, also had its on-off switch fail after two years (before its main board failed). Palm needs to understand that I have other things to do with my money than to spend $200 every two years on a PDA because they didn't make the on-off switch robust enough. One should want to buy a new PDA because of new features and design, not because of mechanical failure. This device has been well taken care of and has not been abused. My wife's Treo 700p had its speaker fail after 45 days, and occasionally the phone portion requires a reset. Although I have not had any problems with Palm software, my IT consultant tells me that the Palm software does not synchronize well with the Windows Tablet operating system. Although I would have liked to stay with the Palm OS, because of the mechanical failures of my two Palms and the Treo 700p, my next PDA will probably be from HP.",1
166,"Does NOT work reliably with an optical mouse. I can occasionally get my Logitech cordless MouseMan optical mouse to work on this pad, but before long, it just stops tracking.  Not surprising, since the pad is a smooth, solid black surface.  It's also quite large and rigid, so I had a hard time fitting it into my desk's tray alongside my keyboard... had to ditch the wrist pad and turn it sideways.  I've given up on it.  I guess if you have the space and the right mouse, it would be a nice mousepad, but it was not the right purchase for me",1
167,"Waster of a weekend. Bought it on a Friday night. Spent 3 hours Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday trying to get everything to work. It took 3 tech people and an hour on hold for them to confirm that there were no upgrades to the software to support M4A files. Not that it's just grabbing files from itunes, but when I just rip a regular CD, it also stores as an M4A file. So, my music was useless on the machine.So, now I'm just left with viewing my photos. That's ok. I can deal with that. However, the help for getting a connection to your wireless networks (both the on line help and on the phone help, mind you) was useless. After 6 hours of getting ""No server found"", I packed it in and returned the item",1

I want a small sleek mobile phone, but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home.  If it we're 1/3 larger it'd be excellent, maybe a great phone for women.

It took a few hours to learn how to download the latest firm ware for the router and n-draft adapter (both from d-link).The wired connections worked great.The wireless conections worked fine for the B (add-on D-link notebook adapter) and G (built-in adapter) laptops, but the other 2 laptops that had the N-draft adapters would not work.  One n-draft adapter was from dell in a brand-new 1505, the other n-draft adapter was from DLINK.   Scary that the dlink adapter would not connect to the dlink router.Even with all of the security disabled, the N-draft adapters would not connect to the router.  With security enabled, and taking all of the right steps to set it up, nothing would connect to the router.  It refused to recognize the security key.After being on hold for an hour, Dlink tried to help me.  They gave me about 20 minutes of support before dropping the call.  Basically, they gave up and said that I should return it.Three weeks ago, I mailed the items to Amazon.  It was well within the 30 day window from the date of purchase.  I am still waiting for a refund.  Why does it take so long?Obviously, I can not give this product a good review.

172,"Disappointing. This home theater package, despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality, is ultimately very disappointing.I'm new to HDTV and HDMI so I didn't know as much as I needed in order to make a fully informed decision.  I have a Sony Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console.This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the TV for each type of input (HDMI, component, etc.).  For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs.The HDMI on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or cable to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your TV.  Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections.The manual for this unit is beyond terrible.  I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like Sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one.  For example, there was a hum when watching TV that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't.  Nothing in the manual about this.There are probably just enough HDMI and component connections for the basic user like myself.Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own.Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output",1

181,"Returned it the next day. For $500, Bose sells an extremely easy-to-setup pair of TV speakers that sound no better than your TV.  The ""Acoustimass"" unit is apparently trying to be a subwoofer, but maybe only dogs can hear it.  Seriously, I unplugged the two main speakers to hear what that big thing was supposed to do, and all I heard was some muffled noise.  (Trust me, I had it hooked up right.)  I fell for the Bose Cinemate at the Target demo wall, where it sounded pretty good.  But once I hooked it up at home and compared it with my TV (Samsung 50 inch DLP) speakers, I realized it was a joke.  I took the advice of reviewer TH below and bought the combination (Onkyo/Polk/Sony) he recommends.  For the same price, much much more value, including better sound and the ability to play other audio sources like CDs.  Can you believe that this Bose unit has absolutely no sound output controls?  You can't even adjust bass and treble.  I will admit, however, that the universal remote they provide worked great, even emulating my Motorola Moxi DVR controls.

My impression was 'pay more and get a better product' but in this case that is not true. This detector gave me nothing more than a series of false alarms or no alarms. When radar was detected correctly, it was either too late (less than 1/4 mile) or the alert signal did not increase as I approached the radar making me think it was another false alarm. Thankfully Cobra covers their units for one full year and it is on its way back for replacement. I will say that their customer service is much better than my luck with their radar detectors. I spoke to a live rep right away, something rare to get these days! A UPS postage paid sticker was sent right out to me. I hope the replacement unit works correctly",1

186,"Horses for Courses. I have no axe to grind with Bose.  I originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up.  This speaker has an incredibly small footprint.  If space is limited, this is not a bad option.However, being honest, this is not a great center channel speaker.  Choosing speakers is like the addage ""certain horses for certain courses.""  Your budget, your room, your components - all play a part.I have two home theater setups.  One is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from Polk Audio.  The other is a dedicated theater utilizing Definitive Technologies with B&K Reference 7.1 Processing.  Clearly the Bose VCS-10 can not hold its own with my larger setup.  However, I have run it with my Polk Audio's and it was workable.  The timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my Polk CSi3 but it was not awful.My bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker.  Can you buy a better one in this price range.  I think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system.  You should always buy the best components within your budget - but remember you are building a system - it's not just about one speaker.  If this speaker fits your space and (more importantly) matches your other speakers, then it may be the right speaker for you",1

The Griffin FAQ on this mentions two issues: RF interference with 433.92 MHz devices (common in home security systems and some phones) and battery issues. They suggest testing the range away from interference and then swapping battery.I tested away from interference and got the same results. Then I took it apart (it's not designed to be opened) and found the battery was cemented in.I called tech support and got a message they were in a meeting. I tried submitting an online message and got a 'server malfunction' error from their server.I'd recommend this device for use in automobiles and motorbikes. It would also work on a bike, but riding a bike with impaired hearing is illegal in some states (and should probably be illegal everywhere)",1

The problem is when I add a second PLB/PC.  Sometimes it works for a while and then the line drops and sometimes it doesn't work at all.  For some reason, the IP addressing goes off when adding a second (or third) unit.  So I am constantly resetting the router, cutting the power, disabling and enabling the PC LAN connection to manipulate them into working again.  Frankly, as you can see, it's driving me up the wall.

197,"features don't work and Panasonic is aware. I have the 2.4 ghz 4000 version and I love it, but it does buzz sometimes because of my home wireless network, so I thought I'd try the 5.8ghz. What a surprise to find it isn't as good. Yes it has some nice features that do work, but over all, it way over priced and flawed. 1. it's really hard to get a call off hold once you place them on hold. I never did figure out how to do that. 2. it's really difficult to call in to get your messages, knowing what to push, waiting to be told and you better have a lot of patience if you push a wrong button. 3. it's supposed to page you when a caller leaves a message. My 4000 pages me with the caller id of the person who left the messages, from the main unit. The hand sets page me with the number of the handset so I know which one the message is on. The new 4500 pages you with a blank page. You don't even have a way of knowing for sure that it was your phone system that did page you. It dials your pager, then nothing, so I get paged with a blank page, as if someone called my pager and didn't leave a message, or my cell phone with number held. 4. the pause key doesn't work in the paging portion of the phone, so you can enter a number and a pause to wait before continuing to enter numbers. 5. The worst part of the phone system is Panasonic, I'm sorry to say. I buy a lot of Panasonic products, but I won't be so much in a hurry to buy this name brand. They do not answer emails, I spent hours on the phone only to have the ""techs"" read to me from the manual that I have... they don't know the phone. No one bothers to ask or look into anything and after they read to you from the manual, they hang up on you, so you have to start over. I took it back and I went back to using my 4000, which is many years old (5 or 6). When I finally did get responses from Panasonic, via email, I was told that ""that feature doesn't work, that feature doesn't work, that feature doesn't work"" and ""if that feature doesn't work, return for replacement"". I had to go back to my email to see the order in which the questions were being answered; very impersonal",1

This might be worth buying if it came with speakers (you'd think Zune would want to provide accessories that compete with iPod instead of making the iPod look so much better!).  I suppose if you want waste more money to buy the remote (sold separately), it might be worth paying twenty bucks for the dock, but definitely not forty or whatever discount Amazon might give",1
200,maybe better with a Sony?. Adds volume but overall I would say the sound quality is very similar or not as good without this device. I use it with my Olympus WS-300m.

I don't use it just in case it makes that noise I don't want it to ruin my recording.,1

The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.

202,"Excellent sound, Bad design. As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars.  However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them.  Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no ""universal speaker mounts"" will work with them.  If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting.

If you're not a Windows user don't bother, it won't work for you!I had to get a refund for mine, the seller was nice enough to give a refund without my having to even send the cable back, since I suppose it would have ended up costing them more to reimburse me for shipping it BACK to them than it did to just give me my money back.The product page needs to specify that this is a Windows-only compatable cable.

Our experience is that for ""the one"" strong local radio station reception overpowered the interference.For the rest of the stations there was significant interference.

216,"2 major design flaws - Buy Kensington version instead. I purchased this product, but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away.The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder!  The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress, the solder breaks.  You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection.  I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter.The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall, it would cause my laptop (IBM T20) to emergency power off.  Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine.  I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter.I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter.  It looks almost like the same product (same OEM?) except they have stronger power tips.  It also didn't have the power-off issue.I loved the form factor, but the product just didn't work",1

Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set ""numbered"" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a ""null"" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead.

237,"Great Sound but In a Stone Age Clock Radio. Let me start out by saying that I love Tivoli radios. I have a Model Two with a Model Sub-woofer in my living room and truly love the warm, rich sound along with the simple design and good looks. I liked the Model Two so much that I decided to buy the Model Three for the bedroom. Even in Mono mode, the sound is rich and exceptional and the tuner truly does pull in and lock onto FM stations as advertised. It looks beautiful and I had planned to order the up-firing companion speaker and have the ultimate clock radio. The problem I have is that as at least one other reviewer has stated the back light for the clock dial is so bright that I have not been able to sleep since I got the radio four days ago. I mean it is bright, you can make shadow figures on the wall from the light it puts out. I had to put a sock over the dial just to get some sleep. Now I feel foolish to have a $200.00 clock radio that I have to cover with a sock at night. Also the LEDS for the sleep and alarm function are bright enough alone to keep you awake. If you use the sleep function the LED stays on after the radio shuts off until you depress the button again and of course the alarm LED stays on all the time the alarm is set. Since Tivoli designed this to be a ""bedroom radio"" it is an inexcusable design flaw to not have include a means of toning down or disabling the back light for users that would prefer darkness while sleeping. I haven't tried the snooze function yet so haven't experienced the ""snooze flaw"" other reviewers have but it sounds pretty scary. One other clock flaw I experienced is that if I get home from work and go through my routine of getting everything ready for the next day before I settle in for the evening I discoverd that the 12 hour clock will sound the alarm if you try to set it for the next day within it seems a 2 hour window after the time you want to set the clock for the next day. In other words if you have the alarm set to wake up at 6:00 A.M. you can't activate the alarm until after 8:00 P.M. This bothers me because I personally have over slept more often by simply forgetting to set the alarm. In conclusion I cannot recommend buying this clock radio until Tivoli takes it back to the drawing board.",1

The problems I have/ had with it is the first month after I would use them the outer ear ( where they sit) would feel sore. (I don't listen to the music loud either so it wasn't that.) My ear doesn't hurt anymore after a use, so you will get use to the discomfort. Then main reason I wouldn't buy this earphone again is because the white cord sticks with dirt like glue. After awhile no matter what i used (clorox wipes, water, hand soap) i couldn't get it to return to it's nice white color and now it looks off-white or basically dirty. I also didn't like the part that connects the earphones to the Ipod or whatever you connect it too. For me, I like to slip my Ipod in my back pocket when i need to use both hands for something, well because there is a bend in the plug, it pops out of my pocket, disconecting from the Ipod. (The Ipod earphones stick straight out and are as thin as the Ipod) Since I'm a student I haven't gotten around to, or feel like spending money, to get another, different  set, I strongly advise you not to buy this product.

256,"The Price Isn't Worth It. Buy Something That Works!. I have owned this projector for almost a year and a half.Let's start with the PROs:Its a projector. It projects. I am using it on a 9.5ft screen in my bedroom.Thats about it for that section.Now onto the CONs:Within a month, the DVD player stopped recognizing any type of media placed in it (DVD, DVD-R, CD). It does not load. Being that I own an alternate DVD-player, I just hooked that one up and ignored the problem, hoping that that would be the end of my difficulties (as shipping back to the company for repair comes out of my pocket, eventhough its under warranty, and not having a ""television"" to watch for that period wasn't beneficial).Next issue came to a head about 8 months after purchase when turning it on one day, the motor ran very loudly (a noise-level you have to speak almost in a yell when sitting beside the person with which you are conversing). The color also seemed to be off (reds appear a muddy brown, image is much darker without variating tones, i.e. naturally high contrast). This more than takes the thrill out of watching bloody horror flix.The only source that has a reduced buzz is when using it as a computer monitor, but this still is very loud, especially on start-up. Since then, this is the only way I watch my movies, through the DVD-ROM on my computer projecting a horrible image on the wall.My computer speakers also provide much better sound than the built-in system speakers, which is very necessary to use in order to hear anything over the loud buzzing (If you close your eyes, you would think it was a chainsaw)The picture itself is also very dim. I have two narrow windows in my room, both with mini-blinds and a curtain, yet it is still difficult in the daytime to watch anything that isn't a bright cartoon. (Back to my love of horror movies, this causes a dilemma)Finally after saving up enough money to purchase a replacement, I am having an Epson Powerlight 76c shipped to me. Hopefully this projector will last longer than the Optoma.I HIGHLY recommend researching other projectors before buying this one. Just because it has a built in DVD-player, don't let that win you over. It's just as easy to hook-up an external DVD-player to a better projector.I purchased this with the 9.5ft screen on the home shopping network for 2200$. Talk about PRICEY! Next time I won't be so hasty to purchase anything. This is a piece of junk. Try the Epson Powerlight 96c. I have researched and read many good things about this projector. It costs less, AND the lumens is 2000, 1000 more than the Optoma, meaning that you can watch dark movies during the day. Hook up your own Cheap $20 DVD-player. I guarantee you that even the cheapest of DVD-players will last longer than this system's built-in one. Go for quality not cheap hooks",1
257,"Looks good, but....... The player came in excellenct condition.  Exactly what we were looking for: compact, sturdy, a pleasure to look at, easy for a 4-year-old to use.

(Disclaimer: I tested the analog video only, not the digital.)But I discovered that it was running extrememly HOT, even when just sitting their idle.  So hot that you literally can't even touch it.

268,"One word, disappointment. I didn't give it a one because it started out ok.  I have a Compaq, Presario with the integrated Intel 817 video chipset.  I purchased  the Ali 6pt USB 2 PCI  to USB card to use with an external 200Gb USB hard drive.  I inserted the card into an open slot and  everything went pretty smooth install-wise.  The card worked wonderfully with the hard-drive.  Then I bought a 30Gb iPod.  This is where my previously  considered 4-star card went south.  I plugged it into the card and everything froze.  I tried every  conceived configuration, but to no avail.  Then I also learned my Odessa 12"" pressure pad, my Compaq USB keyboard, or even a USB Logitech mouse won't even work with it.  The rule of thumb is your USB devices will work as fast as the slowest link in the chain, but it should work.  The iPod works if I plug it into one of my integrated onboard USB 1.1 slots (albeit sans the transfer speed of USB 2).  Frustrated, I did some research and found the chipset the Ali card uses to be incompatible with many USB devices.  What's the point of that?  Lesson learned.  If you're going to buy an inexpensive PCI-USB card and want to take the chance it will work for you then go ahead, but the NEC chipset is the way to go for across-the-board compatibility.  I hope this helps someone",1

Even using fast broadband service at both ends, audio quality was rather poor (I suspect the microphone is not very good) and the video was awful mainly because of the camera's extremely poor quality. I wonder what possessed D-Link to fit such a device with a camera that's about the same level of quality as a $15 USB webcam. Under ordinary interior lighting conditions, it is impossible to get a clear, naturally colored picture: all you will get is a noisy, muddy mess. Of course the lens quality matches the image sensor: it's awful.This is a real shame, because D-Link almost made a pretty good product here. The user interface and configuration are reasonably simple and well explained in the manual, and the performance passable.

282,"Unreliable. With the DiNovo Cordless Media Bluetooth Desktop, Logitech has produced a product with a sleek appearance.   The product looks sharp and the mouse has a nice hand-feel.  The mouse has a rechargeable battery and comes with a recharging cradle, so the disappointment of finding a dead battery in your cordless mouse has been relegated to ""the old days.""  When the product works, there is a noticeable lag between keyboard entry or mouse movement and a response on the screen.  Surprisingly, the lag time seems to be greater for this bluetooth device than my older non-bluetooth cordless desktop, but it is not so long as to make the product unusable.  However, this product has two fatal flaws.  First, as other reviewers have found, my experience with the DiNovo is that it crashes constantly.  Secondly, Logitech is no help whatsoever with this product.  A keyboard and mouse that work less than 50% of the time is simply not acceptable for my needs.  Bottom line is this product didn't even help my clutter problem on my desk, because my corded keyboard and corded mouse have to sit right next to the computer, for rapid access whenever this product decides to stop working.  This product is troublesome, unreliable and decidedly NOT RECOMMENDED",1

The result is that you get a very ""tinny"" sound out of most applications including dvd's.

312,"DVD is disappointment, LCD does its job. We bought ours from Amazon in October, and have been disappointed with the DVD player, which has a flaw documented in the manual that more than outweighs any convenience provided by the built-in player.Unfortunately, we got to the point where the DVD player could not play any DVD's.  Every DVD inserted produced a message ""Disc Not Available"".  I tried Netflix DVD's, then retail DVD's from my library, then opened some DVD's still in shrinkwrap and they would not play.  It was not a problem with DVD scratches, or failing to put the DVD's in the right way.I called Toshiba support, and they recommended a cure that sounded incredulous.  According to the manual, static electricity can ""build up"" in the DVD player, forcing you to physically unplug the REGZA for a few minutes to dissipate the charge.  Of course, to reduce cable clutter, the REGZA is plugged into a receptacle in an out of the way place, but to meet the requirements of the manual, that should be accessible.  The plug going into the back of the REGZA is not even designed so it could be unplugged there, it has to be unplugged at the receptacle.  And, it is not even a grounded power cord, which an electrical engineer I talked to about this said could contribute to the problem in the first place.  After the aforementioned ""hard reboot"" of the REGZA, it resumed playing retail DVD's again.Unfortunately, the DVD player is not of high enough quality to play any of the DVD-R and DVD+R media I've tried so far (TDK, Memorex, Office Depot, Maxell) which were burned with a Sony DVDirect VRD-MC1.  These same DVD's play in my computer DVD drive and with my Pioneer DVD player in another room.On the plus side, we've been happy with the images we get, and haven't noticed some of the LCD artifacts we observe on our smaller Sony WEGA TV.  We watch a lot of HD through cable, and the display is crisp.  We use the HDMI connector, and haven't used any of the computer/network functions of the monitor, so we can't comment on them.  The only minor comment about the display itself is that we use this in a room that is very bright during the day, and very dark at night, so I only wish it had greater range on the low side for its ""Backlight"" setting.If Toshiba can come up with a design that doesn't require periodic unplugging, and can play a more robust range of DVD media, I could recommend it.  As built today, I do not feel the integrated DVD is worth recommending this model",1

315,"Now only if it actually works!. I am now the proud owner of an Archos 404, after spending one traumatic month having owned, in my opinion, the far inferior Archos 504.Inferior, you say? But the 504 has a larger 4.3"" screen, better battery life, a removable battery, and much larger Hard drive capacities (even for the 40 GB). How then, can I say that it is a far inferior product? Well, primarily because the Archos 404 actually works, while the 504 (much to my dismay) does not.You see, beneath that beautiful metallic exterior and beautiful screen of the Archos 504 lies a niggling problem that Archos doesnt want you to know about, especially if you live in a hot and dry location. This product is extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY, sensitive to Electro Static Discharge (ESD), and hangs almost instantaneously if you expose it to even the slightest amount of static. Using this player had become an absolute nightmare for me. Whenever I was listening to music, and would for example want to see which track is playing or skip to the next track etc., I would simply touch the player (whether in its case or outside), and not even press a button, and it would hang instantly. Soon after, I actually used to become nervous every time I needed to touch the player, and soon developed a habit of beforehand touching a metallic object (eg. doorknob) every time I needed to use the player. Needless to say, when one has to do such things just to touch a device, it kind of ruins the experience of owning that device. The 404 suffers from none of these problems, I have been using it for over a month now, and it has not even frozen once.Having said that however, I still give this product two stars instead of just one, because a) the video playback is very good (much better than the 404, and not only because of the larger screen), b) the battery life is decent, and the battery is removable and c) it offers capacities larger than most other video players available today.As for the sound, anyone interested in an Archos 04 series product should know that the volume on these players is significantly lower than the others, even with the latest firmware 1.6.20. I have made a direct comparison using the same pair of headphones with the 5G iPod, iPod Nano, Cowon A2, Cowon X5, and Creative Zen Vision M, either owned by me or by friends, and they are all louder than the Archos. Better, I cannot say, as that is subjective, but certainly and verifiably much louder.",1

In 2003-04, I had a discount on Monster cable through my employer and purchased close to $1000 (retail prices) worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater. I have been using the Gamelink with s-video for my PS2 and that works great. Here it is 3 years later and I buy these Gamelink 400 for use with my new HDTV with component inputs. When I tried to install them I thought I was going to snap the connections off my TV because of the amount of force I had to exert. With much determination I got them to connect. I switched on the PS2 and experienced no video just sound. I had even a harder time removing them. When comparing these cables to my older s-video Gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter, rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter.  In hand, they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires. I will no longer buy Monster cables and I do not recommend these to anyone. Audioquest is much better.  Too bad they don't make gaming cables",1

327,"Complete Junk. I bought these radios for their size and supposed range.  I installed the battery packs, set the frequencies, and was impressed at how compact, solid, and function-packed they seemed to be.That was where it all ended.  I hadn't been using them for ten minutes when little bursts of static came over the line.  My freind kept calling and asking if I had said something.  The squelch seems to not be very discriminating when it differentiates between an actual transmission and background noise.  Ironically his transmissions kept cutting out mid-sentence now and then.  Following each transmission (Assuming you can hear what the other person is saying because of the lousy speakers on these things, see below) is another burst of static that can last anywhere from 1 to 5 seconds.  Extremly irritating.It comes with a vibration mode when the call button is activated, presumably so if someone is in a loud environment they can tell when someone is trying to contact them.  I'm not exactly sure why they bother with this as the lousy speakers they put on these things is barely audible even with the volume turned all the way up, so there's no way you can hear anyone's transmission in a noisy environment anyway.The Lithium Ion battery packs aren't bad, they probably have a good life to them, but I was so fed up with all the other funtional flaws I ended up returning the radios before I had a chance to test battery.In conclusion: Avoid these radios!  They are junk, they have extremly limited range, and they don't work well under the best of conditions.",1

329,"I can't believe they call this junk ""Sony"". I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message ""PROTECT UNPLUG"".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an ""Eject"" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.",1

339,"Beautiful Picture - Poor Quality Control. I bought my first Samsung HLS 5087W on March 6, 2007 from one of the well know ""big box"" Stores.  I chose this model because its picture was far superior to any of the other models in its price range.  I took a chance, however, and bought returned ""open box"" TV, saving a few hundred bucks in the process.  The salesman assured me that the set had been gone over thoroughly before it was put back on sale.When the Television was delivered the picture was stunning, and I was very pleased with my purchase.  After a few days, however, the picture arbitrarily began switching from 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratio.  This would happen every half hour to 45 minutes.  Not a big deal but annoying to say the least.  Instead of returning the set under the store's 30 day return policy, I had them send a service technician out to see what could be done.  He scratched his head and said he'd have to do a little research, and would get back to me in a day or so.  About a week later, with no further contact with the technician, the set developed a new problem - it would cut off every once in a while.  At that point, I had had enough of this dog and sent it back to the store.  However, I wasn't ready to give up on Samsung and their bright and beautiful DLP picture.  I paid the extra bucks and had a brand new, right out of the sealed box HLS 5087W delivered.The new TV had been in my house for less than two hours when it lost sound.  I checked all connections and determined that it was a problem in the TV.  An hour or so later I turned the set back on and everything was fine.  I watched it for about an hour thinking all was well when the sound failed again.  I returned to the store that night and told them my sad tale.  The salesperson told me that they had, indeed, had several of these Samsung models returned for various problems.  He said they seemed to be having major quality control problems.  I told him to come get the TV.I took a chance the first time on an open box model and got burned.  I chalked it up to the old adage that ""you get what you pay for.""  The second time around I took no chances and paid full price for a brand new version of the TV, but still no luck.  Not being a complete fool, my third was not a Samsung.  It's a shame that a TV with such a beautiful picture has to be done in by poor quality control.",1

It makes a hissing sound when it's turned off. Now, it wouldn't bother me too much in a basement (althought it would still be anoying), but it's a definite NO NO in the bedroom.2. Rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them.If you don't mind these 2 things, then by all means go for it.Aug 2005 UPDATE:Having nothing better to do, I went and purchased another unit from Costco to see if indeed I have a bad unit or it's a design/manufacturing issue.Surprise surprise...second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder!Curious enough (i'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics) i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from. It is the AC/DC transformer, more specific two 330uF capacitors making this noise.That is really poor design and/or low quality components!!! I did not expect this from a brand name like Philips.

The unit is very slow and the hard drive base unit takes alot more power from your machine. I use this with my Dell Axim X50v, and though it works, the battery consumption is very noticable. Also, the speed of the drive is definately not the fastest. Like I said above, for the $150 that I paid summer of 2006, it was a great deal but as all things, prices drop and if I had to do it over, I would skip this and go for flash based unit",1

Returning this item so I can get something decent.  The money saved is NOT worth it",1
361,"Not for running. I wore these yesterday for the first and last time.  I bought these headphones in hopes that they would stay in or at least near my ears when running.  They didn't last one minute.They are very light, but at the same time very flimsy.  The over-ear design does nothing in the way of supporting the buds in you ears like I had hoped.The buds are set at an awkward angle and found myself having a hard time, even when stationary, keeping them in or on my ears.As far as sound, holding them on my ears they sounded terrific albeit very uncomfortable.  Holding them in place also pretty much defeats the purpose of having headphones.  Another thing to be noted, the volume control on the cord is a terrible idea.  The volume pod itself probably weighs as much as the headphones.  Unless the volume control is secured somehow it is very problematic doing any sort of activity.These are probably what to expect out of a $10 set of headphones.Comfort:      1/10Sound:        6/10Design:       2/10Cost-benefit: 3/10",1

365,"Back-UPS ES drops power AFTER power is restored!. Most people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works. I tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage. I set it to shutdown Windows after 1 minute. Only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it.After power was cut, it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down. Then I restored power to the UPS. AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted. That is unacceptable. A UPS should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it.",1
366,"not what I expected. I purchased this dvd recorder to go with the sony hdd camcorder.  They should have been perfectly compatible, but mine has been nothing but trouble. The first time I used it, it simply froze at 99% complete and I had to shut it down and start over after waiting 3 hours for it to finish.  After that, it recorded from the camera, but seemingly randomly, not in the order I videotaped on the camera, and incompletely burned video segments from the camera as well.  Plus, there is no editing capability whatsoever with this device.  I use very high quality Taiyo Yuden dvd's in it, so I know it is not the discs",1
367,"Breaks too easily. Cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups, but after a few months light use, I lost sound through one cup then the other. In general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on. The batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself. Very disappointing, but for the price, this is hardly unexpected",1
368,"After a year's use, not a keeper. I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit, which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit, they'd look at it under warranty. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it.Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned unit was ""within specifications"" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. Units will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have.For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there unit. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like.Each of the units had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the unit is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight.The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the unit will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand.If the battery runs out of juice, the unit is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone.I complained about this to support at Garmin, and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course.To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the unit resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where ""Home"" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue.The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle.On the contacts database, the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code.In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the unit assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel.I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road.On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations.On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take Garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmin's fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files",1

372,"The Worst Waterproof Heaphones on the Market. I have spent from $20-$100 on waterproof headphones over the last 2 years and I can say, without hesitation, these are the Absolute Worst of the bunch.  Before I discuss this brand, I would like to say, if you are a swimmer and buy waterproof headphones, they are going to short out so be ready to buy new ones every few months. That having been said, let's talk about the H2O brand.The first thing that I could not understand about these headphone is why a bungy cord behind the neck would be so short.  There is no way for any normal person to use these comfortably.  Once they are in your ears, you are not able to comfortably rotate your head without pulling at least one of the ear pieces out of your ear.  To solve the problem, I just removed the head piece so that I would just have the ear pieces and could stick them in my ears and swim away.  Well, that was not possible because the ear pieces continuously slipped out of my ears.  I even changed the ear piece covers to some that I had used in the past. The ear pieces still slipped out of my ears. I spent more time fiddling with this garbage than I did swimming.Let me just sum this up by saying, this is the only pair of waterproof headphones that I have thrown away that still worked. These are the worst headphones ever.  Opt for the $20 brand, they work just fine after you cut the tips off and replace them with your own!",1

378,"Poor Product. Despite not being written on the packaging or website my HP iPaq RX3417 was compatible with this keyboard.Unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad, clogging my PDA making it run very slowely. As well as this, it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change.In terms of hardware, I found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem. While targus does include all 5 rows of a standard keyboard, it shrinks the top row (numbers) and the bottom row (space bar). This makes it very difficult to use the space bar (which is for some reason split into three parts) and the numbers (which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way). I found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register. In terms of key position, there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult. Some keys are also very small (e.g. the right shift key and backspace) making them difficult to use (strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards).One of the biggest problems I had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys. Targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen. This mouse cursor is useful, but needs to be supplemented with normal Up, Down, Left and Right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document. Using the mouse to do this is very frustrating.The final negative thing about this keyboard was the price. I paid AUD$149.95 for this keyboard. Doing some research on the internet found better models (i.e. Think Outside Stowaway IR Keyboard) available for less than half the price (around AUD$70) and bluetooth keyboards available for less than AUD$190. I think it might be about time Targus releases a new model PDA keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get. No more tiny keys and no more than two space bars",1

The reason I purchased it was because it would save on space. Well, it may save on space, but the functionality was reduced to nearly ZERO. The cons:-Audio popped in and out when playing MP3 CD's. Also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio.-Hissing (especially from the rear speakers) when the unit was turned off.-Low volume from the rear speakers.-Didn't play many DVD's right (it would just stop, as if it couldn't read it).-Will not read DVD-R/RW's.-STUTTERING PICTURE. It did this on ALL DVD'S PLAYED. Every few seconds (it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences) it looked as if it would drop a few frames. The audio never varied from being spot on, but it looked as if the player couldn't keep up with the DVD. This is what killed it for me.

It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform",1

The router worked flawlessly, and the notebook card gave me a weak / intermittent signal where I wanted to use it. This was however an improvement over my previous 802.11b Linksys wireless router that gave me no signal at all at this location.After about an hour of use, I got the 'blue screen of death' on my new Dell dual core laptop that warned that a serious error occurred and Windows was halted to prevent further damage. It further warned that if I recently installed new hardware I should reboot and uninstall the hardware. I rebooted, Windows came back, and I uninstalled the notebook card. I called Belkin tech service to report the problem, but the rep just kept trying to get me to reinstall the card. Nope. Too risky. I'll return the card.By the way, when you install the card, Windows warns that the product is not Windows logo certified. Belkin's instructions state that you should ignore this warning and install anyway.I hope Belkin addresses the issue with a firmware update and gets Windows logo certification",1
410,"Did not perform as advertised. This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that",1

The latest Nero Burning ROM *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset.

However, at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware, quite unlike the Verbatims. That's why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics.

420,"Stop and Save your money. I waited a while before submitting a review to give this unit a good try. I already had a portable unit (Garmin) but wanted an in-dash unit for my other car. At the time this unit was twice as much as the Garmin but it also played dvds. I was very disappointed once I got this unit which cost twice as much as the portable and more than most of the other units of the market. The biggest disappointment was that he does not guide you a fraction as well as any of the portable units on the market. The Garmin will take you right to the door of the address you put in. This unit (if it can find the address) gets you there and says ""you have arrived.."". But where, which side of the street, which building etc. My Garmin will take me right to my own front door and this expensive unit gets me in the area and then I am left to figure out which building (all having unique addresses) I am looking for.The detachable controls for the unit would make you feel that you paid $200 for the unit. It feels like it is mostly plastic and that it couldn't cost them very much to make. The radio unit I had in the car prior had a great detachable unit with its own carrying case - you get no such thing with Pioneer. I thought that was a bit cheap of Pioneer not to even include a carrying case for such an expensive unit.The interface with the unit is awkward and time consuming. When you put in an address it apparently searches in both the state of Washington (where I live) and in Oregon. I called pioneer to ask if I could just search in Washington since I didn't care about the addresses in other states at this time and when I did I could just put that state in. By the way, this is a regular feature on the portable units. Pioneer tap dances around the answer but the bottom line is - no.  What can you expect from the only unit on the market where you have to put over to the side of the road and apply parking brakes multiple times before switching addresses.I would get into the problems Pioneer has with getting its map upgrades out. Again, something I spoke to them about and you should hear the song and dance they give on that. However, if that was the only thing wrong with paying twice as much for a unit that delivers half as much as the portable units I would just complain to Pionner.Save money. If you want a good reliable gps unit look at either the portable units or one of the other brands of in-dash ones. As for the built-in dvd players you can get one of those put in your car for a fraction of the price.Remember you can always take back one of the portable units but with the Pioneer you have put out an extra $200 to get it installed as well so no real taking it back. I urge you to shop carefully if you are at all looking at purchasing this unit.On a positive note, it is fun to watch the screen come out and pop up with you first turn it on. But I am not sure that the price was worth that",1

422,"APC 350ES - Very poor UPS. I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so.Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here",1

It then started to reset itself, constantly going on and off never completing the task of finding an address. I sent it in for repair and they sent me back the same unit with no repair and all the maps removed. Finally I just had to return to Amazon. I have lost my faith in Magellan and going over to Garmin. I bought the c530 yesterday and saw far it works right out the box, The navigation is spot on. Although it does not say the street names, the directions are very clear and accurate. I can put it inside my window sill in my apartment and get a signal. The 2200T took forever and indoors even by the window could not get a signal. While I did like the photo veiwer and mp3, neither one was  worth writing home about. The mp3 was tinny and with a cassette adapter played with such static on my stereo it just was not worth it.

The Toughskin case does all three and is EXACTLY what I was looking for protection. The only down side to the Toughskin case is that the zune will not fit in this docking station while it is in the case. I believe that is an engineering problem of the docking station. This is NOT a bulky case, it fits the zune perfectly, however, even with removing the insert of the docking station, the zune does not fit the dock while in the case. Why they didn't make a docking station that would accommodate a zune in a fitted case, makes no sense. No one is going to want to take the trouble of removing a case each time they dock their zune. They should take these docking stations back from customers who feel as I do and replace them at THEIR expense with something that works! As for the Toughskin case, I highly recommend it; the other cases just didn't seem to offer this quality of protection while also having a nice professional appearance.",1

431,"BUGS OF PREVIOUS YEAR MODEL STILL PRESENT. I have owned the DMR-ES40V for over 6 months. It is a combo DVD/VCR unit. I have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit.The MANUAL:  It is imperative to have the manual. This machine is somewhat complicated, and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. If everything is working correctly, you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. It is overly time-consuming though, since the items don't seem to logically flow. If you dig long and hard enough though, they are in there somewhere.The SET-UP: Being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater, this was generally easy. The text and pictures were sufficient. Searching through the Function Menu, I learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. This is needlessly confusing. Of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( I haven't seen an accurate one yet).DVD PLAYBACK: The general playback is pretty straight-forward. I really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my JVC progressive player (which is 3 years older). Finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. A Zoom feature is missing. Many convenience features are not present.DVD RECORDING: Recording onto a DVD-RAM disc is a dream compared to old fashioned VCR tapes. I really enjoy using them. A quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. This mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording, then select the show to watch from the Navigator. The UHF tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. Other weak channels record but not 19. This problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. There is an annoying bug with Daylight Savings Time, and the newer extended time period. The Panasonic Web Site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the DST box; thus removing the feature. If this did anything, it would allow you to set the clock manually. Being without the automatic DST adjustment would not be annoying, but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm EST. This ruins any TV scheduling you had set. This malady persisted until the date of the former DST Spring-Ahead arrived. Several weeks of scheduling hell! I requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. No message, no number to call--just a promise to call again when I was home.THE VCR USE: This feature is really buggy. You are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. When a TV show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. It doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. This is really annoying.LAST IMPRESSION: The last movie (Last King of Scotland) I watched took over the machine. The remote control would not function, the disc would not stop, and the disc could not be ejected. It was necessary to unplug the unit, restart it, eject the disc, and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. Worse some settings are no longer selectable. One other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty JVC unit.I must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what I read at this forum and other ones. These units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. I recommend looking elsewhere.",1

The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used.

445,"Familiarity breeds contempt. I wanted to give this calculator higher marks. On paper it appears to have alot going for it:o two line displayo editable equation historyo persistent function memories (4)o ""440"" functionso bitwise logical operators and five number baseso neat cheat sheeto equation solverHowever, the more I got to know this calculator the more I disliked it.1. The large glass panel covering the display (and the top 1/3rd of the unit) is highly reflective and makes the display hard to read under flourescents.2. The two line display is a source of continued frustration. The top line, which at first appears to be the input area, shares this function with the bottom line. Function key presses register immediately on the top line. The bottom line is for numeric input which only registers on the top line when a function key is pressed.  Yuk! I often find myself having to delete redundant digits due to this input area confusion. Not so with the Casio Fx-115MS.3. The {algb} function suffers from [2]'s poor functional separation of input/output. Prompting for variable input is severely restricted--only the numeric input line is available--thus no expressions, only simple numeric literals.  To populate the variables with expression results you must first evaluate and store these BEFORE executing the {algb} operation.4. The equation solver is also lame. No underlying algebraic rewrite rules are in effect as with the Casio Fx-115MS and HP 33s. So, if you want to perform a Time Value Money series, you will have to rewrite the equation yourself for each variable of interest (periodic payment, period interest rate, number of periods, principal, future balance).With its beaucoup functions I'm sure this calculator has alot to offer engineers. However, the function memory and equation history persistence don't quite compensate for its disturbing lack of elegance",1

454,"I miss my stowaway. I bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when I replaced my Palm m105 with an HP IPAQ. The palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and I used in nearly every day.  After my positive experience I expected my new IR keyboard to function the same way.  What a dissapointment! I can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me. I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys.  The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The ""mouse"" arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys. Finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard (unlike the stowaway). I will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search",1
455,"Waste of money. Ok, never buy electronics online. I first ordered this tablet online, and when I got it, it installed just fine, however, the pen was not working. Had Adesso send a new pen. Seemed to work fine. But when I started drawing, the tablet itself made the pen jerk at two spots which looked like two strips might not have been working. So it was impossible to draw anything with it. Had that returned for a new one.Now when it comes to actually drawing, the pressure sensitivity and the actual use of the pen itself were just downright awkward. Pressure is one thing, it can be adjusted and I could just learn how to use it. But the pen itself needs to be almost pointing directly down on the tablet in order for it to even see the pen was there. Tilt the pen too far down like a normal person draws, and the point of the pen would no longer be touching the pad, because it's so small.It has a USB cable, so it should be plug and play. The tablet gets recognized, but the pen takes a while for it to even be able to move the mouse cursor around to do anything with it. The pen and mouse are wireless, so the tablet picks up their signal when touching. There's a light that keeps flashing when neither is touching the pad, but when they do the light stays lit. But even with this happening, the pen does not always begin working even if the light is lit.Simply getting a hold of Adesso was a chore in itself. After going online sending e-mails, and even calling them on the phone, the whole situation took a few months in total for them to give me a return number so I could mail it back to them, until they finally had the free time to send me a new one, which is still not reliable.Now buying a pricey product online was my own fault, because if you get it at the store you can return it right away and have the whole thing settled in a day or two. Sending things by mail takes days, weeks, and eventually a few months in my case. Don't buy this, or any product from Adesso",1

457,"Just Smears Dirt Around. To start off with, It's hard to start the wipes through the hole in the cap.  You have to take the cap off and then take the foil seal off, then you find the start of the roll.  It's glued down like the start of a roll of toilet paper.  (They say you are supposed to start in the middle of the roll but I couldn't find the middle!) Then you have to feed the wipes up through four very tough plastic tabs in the cap.  The only problem is the hole is small and tabs are not very flexable.  I was honestly afraid my finger was going to get stuck in the hole. (It didn't) I think the safest way to do it is to use a pencil or pen to start them with.  Once I did get them started, the tabs are so inflexable that the first sheet just tore in half no matter how carefully I pulled on it.  So I took the cap back off, started the next sheet.  This one came out in one piece, and tore off the roll, BEFORE THE NEXT SHEET STARTED THROUGH THE HOLE. (grrr) OK, forget feeding the sheets through the hole.  I just take the sheets straight off the roll.  So now I clean my computer monitor, which is pretty dirty.  (It's in a room with 3 smokers)  I can clearly see that it's just smearing things around.  I check the sheet itself.  It looks clean still.  I sit and watch as this filmy substance dries on my screen, with very pronounced, very visable streaks.  I try another sheet.  Still got streaks from hell.  A third sheet later, I can't seem to make the streaks disappear.  They only move around.  I say forget it and clean my moniter the old way.  I say forget this stuff.

463,"Promising prototype; poor finished product. For me the main drawback of this unit as a clock radio lies in the primitive interaction between the radio and clock.  It is basically a clock attached to a one-way time switch.  The radio has to be switched off by hand and the alarm set to go each night - unlike a wall time switch but just like the traditional alarm clock. You can't reset the alarm when turning the radio off in the morning because there is no AM/PM distinction.  This might all be fine if you have never had a clock radio before, but for the last 30 years or so the canonical design that works very well has been automatic switch on, every morning, with usually an hour or so of run time before automatic switch off - set and forget.The clock itself is rather small, poorly-lit and difficult to tell the time from when half-asleep.I found the sound quality unremarkable for current table radios.  Higher frequencies rolled-off a bit too quickly and bass tended toward boxiness, perhaps because of the bass port being tuned in an attempt to reach too low frequencies for the driver and cabinet combination.In side-by-side comparison with the Boston Acoustics Recepter, the latter had greater clarity and presence and a more pleasing bass, though suffered slightly from bass boominess (doubtless also from pushing the bass port tuning a bit far).  For functionality as a clock radio, it wins hands down and the Tivoli I'm afraid has to go back",1

467,"Mediocre sound quality, questionable reliability, weak radio reception. I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making ""S"" sounds sound more like ""H"" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.",1

You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.

479,"The colors are great but kills budget system performance.... I purchased this AGP to run 3d software occasionally and not really for games.

It recommend exiting hardware wizard and running the ATI install. The amount of software that was installed was overwhelming and unnecessary. All you need is Catalyist and the drivers. Not file player, ALL-IN-ONE-WONDER, REMOTE-WONDER, Multimedia Library, unless you plan to watch TV on the PC. (I don't). The card has no fan but a large heat sink. I have a Sempron 3100+ with 1 GB ram, additional cooling fans and 300 Watts. With all that the system was shutting down from overheating. I lessen the resolution and refresh rate to no avail. The card showed rich cooler and the built in 3d configuration, pc check and screen savers worked with no problem. But just doing web surfing, playing quicktime, running 3D screensaver causes overheating. No games. The video payback was choppy. My onboard video that came with the motherboard outperformed the card but can't run 3D. As a test, the card couldn't run even the most basic 3D game demo even in it's lowest detail settings.

487,"Case Logic Needs Better Designers, FAST!. I really need binders that can hold more discs as my collection grows and as so many new DVD releases are multiple disc sets, so I was really hyped about the release of this new 80-disc binder.  Boy was I DISAPPOINTED.I bought mine at a local retailer.  But before purchasing it, I noticed that the binder came with two types of sleeves: 10 each of the old 2-disc design and 15 each of the new 4-disc design. I thought the binder was tampered with, so I started to inspect at least 6 other binders and found the same allocation of sleeves in each of them.  So instead of potentially storing 100 discs (25 sleeves x 4 dics/sleeve), I'm left with only 80 max.  At least it was accurately advertised as an 80-disc binder, but wouldn't it be better if it held 100?  BUT, the bad thing is that the dimensions of the 2-disc and the 4-disc sleeves are different, with the 2-disc sleeve being between 1/4"" to 1/2"" shorter on a given side.  So if you have the 2 types of sleeves interspersed in your binder, you may easily miss some of your discs stored in the shorter sleeves when you flip through it.I bought the binder anyways.  It wasn't until I started using the binder at home that I found really bad things about the new 4-disc sleeves that just totally irritated me.  The openings for you to insert the discs are so minimally cut out that the only way you can take a disc out of the sleeve is to GRAB the disc with your fingers, causing fingerprints and possibly even scratches on the surface.  To make matters worse, the sleeves have notches in them that I am guessing were designed to hold the disc in place so that the disc doesn't fly out while you flip through the binder.  But these notches hold the disc so tightly that they make you have to GRAB the disc even harder to remove it from the sleeve.  The old sleeves, though not perfect, were designed much better because the cutouts were large enough for you to stick your forefinger into the disc's hole and slip the disc out by its edges.My only option now is to hope the current Case Logic designers are replaced with more talented and creative ones soon because my DVD collection just got bigger with the new Star Wars release",1

The mounting cradle then semi permanently mounts to that mounting arm. This cradle allows for easy insertion and removal of the Magellan unit. If you buy this all you are getting is the cradle. Without an arm this is a worthless piece of plastic. Not even a very pretty piece of plastic that could serve as a Christmas ornament..",1

It put out enough humidity to keep our bedroom moist, and it wasn't loud-especially in comparison to other humidifiers we've tried.THEN, on the third day, I noticed brown streaks on the paint on the wall nearest the humidifier.  I washed them off without any real problem, just thinking this would be a pain to do every few days.  Well they were back the next day, and so I decided to clean the entire humidifier as well (which you're only supposed to have to do weekly).  There was brown bacteria growing in the water tray and the base!  It was so disgusting, and very hard to get off, even with bleach and water.  Our water does not have a high mineral content, and I was using filtered water anyway.I bet if you clean this unit every single day, that wouldn't happen, but who wants to clean a humidifier every single day, especially when there is a baby in the mix?  I'm just glad that we tried it out a few weeks before our baby is due!  I can't wait to take it back",1

The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the ""acoustimass"" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very ""tinny"" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.

After returning two players i decided to buy a Philips DVP5140 (Multiformat DVD Player with Divx, MP3, Windows Media Support) which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly!

512,"Need warranty repair........forget it. Purchased this TV from Walmart, on Feb 1'st.  On Feb 13, took it to the repair shop for warranty repair.   Was told after 5 days, that the part that it needed was no longer available.  And that they would send me a  replacement TV.   The TV was a 2005 model, manufactured in 3/2006.   Was asked to fax my receipt.   Samsung gets my receipt and says that it is to blurred to read.   Have spent hours on hold trying to get to their customer support about the TV.   I feel that since I have called several times to try to get some answers that Samsung is recognizing my name or case number  and just ignoring my being on hold.   Yesterday was on hold for an hour and a half with music playing in my ear.   Monday, I will fax them an 8X10 copy of my receipt that I hope will not be too blurred to read.   So things are still up in the air.  Was getting the TV for a bedroom, and had plans to buy a 40 inch soon.   No way, will I buy it from a Samsung dealer.   With all this calling and waiting, my 30 day return policy has passed and I stuck having to make payments on it. I had the TV for about 10 days, and even though it was my first LCD type TV , had to learn about it.  I could not turn it on or off, except with the remote.  Neither did the controls on the side work.  So I can not give any opinion about picture quality or anything..........just want them to send my replacement TV.   So beware of needing any repair while in warranty.   And if your TV is not working as it should, take it back and do it quickly, and forget about having any warranty work done.

515,"Look elsewhere for better values. When you move significantly above the $100 mark with headphones, one naturally expects superior sound and build quality - things that can be found with competing phones like the Grado SR125, Alessandro MS1, or even the Sony MDR-V6. For one thing, the body of these headphones is made of a relatively flimsy plastic, and lends little in the way of confidence in the product. The sound - the part that matters - may impress neophyytes with their strong bass, but balance and richness of tone are sorely absent. Perhaps that's why may TriPort owners find themselves defecting to other products.Bose has earned a name through aggressive advertising and name recognition, but if you're a savvy shopper (and are willing to look at some superb competing headphones (sometimes at half the price), you and your music will be in a better place",1

So, we can't use any of our friend's productions (I have several musician friends who record their own music) and we can't play any of our own compilation CDs in it.  Bummer.  CDs that play in every other CD player we own but not in this one.  In addition, older CDs have a tough time getting kick started.  Newer ones (last 10 years or so I guess) are OK.

522,"Very Disappointing Product. This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting.The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the device on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell.The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads  to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost.I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The Docupen is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate.Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility.I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time.If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out ""paperless"" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed.Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy. The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential, especially when coupled with a Tablet PC. However, the execution of the idea needs improvement. I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years, at a price that is comparable to quality.",1

The longest capture I have managed so far is 15 minutes, but most range in size from one minute to six minutes. After spending a day splicing together the fragments of a VHS tape I converted with the 350 and which I then burned to DVD, I discovered the quality of the image far below DVD quality.

So this comes in as an important piece of protection.Unfortunately in low light environment, especially when there's still enough light for the backlight of the keyboard to be off, you just can't see the keys anymore. Because of this issue, 1/2 of the time i'm not using the protection. The protection is very sticky on the side that goes against the keyboard, meaning that when you don't use it, it gathers a lot of dust very quickly, beating the purpose of having that ""skin"" on top of your keyboard.Another good idea, that really needs more thinking, as to what material should be used so that it's fully transparent",1

If I jam the soundpiece *into* my ear (which is seriously uncomfortable and takes some work because it's too large to fit in there easily!), the ear-hook doesn't even touch the top of my ear.  Just poor design overall.On the positive side, seemed to be sufficient for Skype (which is what I had bought it for).

Sony Premium Grade T-120 VHS Tapes used to be pretty darn good.These days that is not the case.The past few times that I have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish,there have been to many flaws with the tape.One problem has been a line through the middle of the picture,like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about 20 years old,and also there have been jumping pictures,and small audio flaws as well.I use various brands of videotape,so I know that the problem lies here with the Sony videotape.Basically the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and over.They show too much wear way too soon.Get Maxell tapes instead",1
550,"expensive and no good. I must say I bit into this Senheiser scheme. I paid a lot of money on a product that should not cost that much.First of all I should say that I only paid 65 dollars for it and I still think it is much more than it is worth.Now the problems:1.	It is called open air design or something like that, bottom line is everybody in the room and the neighboring rooms can hear what you are listening. What is the purpose of the headphones then? I could play my games using the speakers and have a better experience.2.	The highs are too high and the lows are too low. First time you use them you say oh it sound great but after a time it gets annoying.3.	These are supposed to be audiophile ones. I play my guitar sometimes at 2 at night, this was the reason for the new headphones (I got tired of my old ones - they had a very short wire). Now the problem is I use a lot of distortion and because the highs are too high and so on they are horrible. I went back to my old ones and I am only using these with my computer during the day or when nobody is at home.Anyway my opinion is that I should have bought the $20 Phillips model that I used to have before these",1
551,needs TWO USB slots... i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive. wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability. there's nothing convenient about its need for 2 USB slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing. nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging... if you're reading the requirements for Mac OS X you miss the bullet point in the Win XP section calling out the need for 2 free ports. Amazon's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing TWO USB ports...boooo seagate. i'm offended that you're offering such clumsy connectivity,1
552,"Tivoli subwoofer sounds more like a chihuahua than a bulldog. I have my Tivoli model 2, which I love, hooked up through an inexpensive home theater system and it sounds great.  But sometimes I want to listen to the radio without using the home theater.  The sound quality is a bit tinny so I decided to try the subwoofer to fill in the low end.  When I received the new speaker I was impressed with it's eye-appealing design.  I immediately hooked it up to the model 2 and turned it on.  I didn't hear much difference so I cranked it's volume knob up to the max.  The bass response improved, but just a little bit.  I guess I'll continue to play the radio through the $40 home theater.  In summary, the subwoofer looks great but the sound quality is disappointing",1
553,"Eugh - Yuk!. Some of you guys must have some crummy soundcards installed on your machines if this widget sounds better than your stock unit.In theory of course, the AA micro should be the business. It's a dedicated D/A or D/D unit as far as I can tell. But the transients are terribly produced - No solid sound stage, I'm also hearing added noise. And I'm not expecting audiophile quality either! I'm using a mid range pair of Sennheisers on my IBM X40 Thinkpad. Seriously, the installed sound card is quieter and does a far better job. I tried a variety of apps (musicmatch, mediaplayer, audition) with the same results. The noise is not constant, so must be in the conversion stages, instead of interference.Wanted to love this - but it's rubbish",1
554,"Hypersensitive and bascially doesn't work. I bought this DVD player for the multi-region capabilities but I now have a much bigger problem: I can't watch ANY of my DVDs. This player seems to be extremely sensitive to the slightest scratch or smudge -- and it really does not like discs I've burned myself. Every time I use it there's a 50% chance it won't load the disc at all. I have to wait about 5 minutes to find out. If it DOES load, it will likely stop several times - and probably never start up again. Very frustrating! Don't know what is wrong with this thing - but I've tried dozens of discs with the same result. I'll be looking for something else. This thing just does not work",1
555,"Did Not Work. This product does not work at all. I called tech support and they agree. They told me to send it back and get another one. I did. It did not work either. I sent it back and got my money back. Amazon was great, but the AVerTV card is junk",1
556,Dont even think about it..... I had been using philips adapter that i got from Walmart and was quite satisfied with it until the wire broke when it got entangled. I bought this one just because it was MAXELL and i had to make 25$ in order to qualify for free shipping. But the moment i inserted it in my stereo i realized my mistake. It sounded terrible. The very same day i went to walmart and picked up philips adapter once again. You can try others as well but dont even think about this one...,1

The OEM NP-800 (rated at 800mAh) can take 150 - 200 photos, but the SterlingTek can only take a few dozens. I didn't bother to return them because of the hassle and shipping charges.If you want to use third-party batteries, try Lenmar or Ultralast. I have used them on my Sony Alpha A100 and Panasonic Lumix LX2. The performance has been great from these brands",1

These do work great for organizing CDs and DVDs, and I do still use them, but I found that the two inside CDs/DVDs can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page. I kept my TV DVDs in these pages for awhile, and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge. A few of my Simpsons discs still won't play certain episodes. So I keep all the discs on the outside slots only, and I've never had another problem with them. I use the inside slots for liner notes/episode lists, though I usually have to trim them to make them fit right",1
560,"Great service if you never plan on canceling. I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player",1
561,"nothing but problems... I bought this television in December. The problems occurred in March. I made a request to have a repairman come and he basically replaced everything in the unit. The problem was the light engine. Now that the parts in my tv are brand new, I thought my problems were well behind me, but I was wrong. After it was fixed 2 days ago, more problems occurred. When i try to change the contrast, brightness, etc., the settings would reset once I turned off the tv. Also, sometimes the tv won't turn on, it would just make this weird buzzing noise. The picture is now worse than before.For all the new owners, please advise that you will be dissapointed once it turns into a dog like mine did. The tv may work great out of the box and you may be tempted to write a ""5 star"" review on here shortly after viewing the tv, but wait until 2 months approaches and I guarantee you will have Nothing But Problems. Write a review after 2 months and you will see what I mean.",1
562,Junk. This is the worst pice of electronics I ever bought. Started falling apart after few days only. Battery life is a joke.Software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it won't work with OS prior to XP. You will find that out after you're done installing it. Mediocre performance. Don't waste your money on this one.,1

564,"iHome is a disappointment. So when I first got the iHome for Christmas, I loved it. Well, I loved it in spite of the glaring bright light, that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep. However, after awhile the iHome will not register my iPods existence at all. Today I was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again. I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations. So, the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled. Useless",1
565,"If you enjoy static, this is the phone for you!. I've had this phone for approx. 9 months now, maybe longer...and I truly don't know how I've stood using this dual phone system for so long.  However, tonight I've taken a giant step ""upward"" towards better quality and design with the Panasonic KX-TG 5432M dual system.This dual handset is the worst I've ever experienced in a cordless system.  From the moment I set it up, the static has been atrocious.  Step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear.  I can't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person.  Even within six feet of the base I receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting, not only to me, but to the other person on the other end...for they hear it too. I will never purchase another uniden product, if this is the non-quality of product they put out.  I had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system...and I wish I'd never gotten rid of it.As the title says...If you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone, this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear. The melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep, but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head. Uniden should be ashamed of this product.Stepping down from the soapbox now..",1
566,"DO NOT USE AS A DATA DRIVE!!. I have been a long time user of Sony's minidisc equipment. I mainly liked the removable media feature. For about $3, I could copy a whole CD to one regular minidisc and keep it in my media library. The early units seem to be made better. The more recent units look to be cheaply made. There is one inherent design flaw with a media that has to spin. The read/write heads have to move back and forth across the media, and this is the weak point. There is a tiny ribbon cable that attaches to the read/write head. THIS CABLE WILL FAIL in time. It may be 6 months, it may be three years, but it will happen. When it does, you will get the famous ""BLANKDISK"" error whenever you insert your disc. This will destroy whatever data was on the disc. No great loss if you use the minidisc for music only, but a potential disaster if you use it for backing up data (which I used to do). I researched this on minidisc forums and found that It had happened to others.I used minidiscs for data backup because the $3, 300MB discs were perfect for my needs. After loosing valuable data, I have put all 3 of my units and dozens of recorded and blank discs in a drawer. Probably never to be used again",1
567,"Great TV for the Price. I like the fact that you can save money with not having a tuner that you do not need.  The Monitor is light and was easy to hook up.  The picture, even not in high definition is great.  DVD's look great on the screen, although the picture in widescreen does not fill the screen as you would think it would.  That is the one downside to this otherwise great television.",1
568,"This product doesn't work. I bought a Netgear WG311T wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed.  First, I coudln't get a connection to the router.  Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet.  I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet.  A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!)  Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box.  Don't buy this product!  If you're not convinced, go to the Netgear user forum and read the horror stories there",1
569,"Unacceptable. This model was intended as a replacement for my not-very-old and yet quite functional Panasonic PM-series stereo.  This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night.Unfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor.  Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver.  Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony",1

When I got them home, I opened the package and found most of the cases were missing the little plastic hinge.Tried to return them, but BestBuy accused me of breaking them. I went into the store and inspected the other packages. Those too had most of the hinges missing. Go ahead, buy 'em if you want to. You'll just end up throwing most of them away",1

I guess I was supposed to tape this plastic, er the screen protector, onto the screen, but there wasn't even enough tape to keep the plastic on! This is the biggest waste of $18 I've ever spent. There are better, cheaper products out there that are actually worth the money",1
575,"Good idea poor design poor  implementation. I have had my Nuvi for approx 6 to 7 months and overall I am somewhat satified.  Initally I could see no flaws it was perfect I recommend the Nuvi to 3 friends and they all bought one.  First impression, features on the Nuvi 660 are without a doubt very cool and a step above everyone else. Now to the not so good stuff which is really a deal breaker for me. First after a month and half the unit locked up, my friends locked up after 2 weeks of light use.  Once a nuvi locks up it has to be sent back to Garmin the reset does not work restarting it wont work nothing.  We both had the same issues and our units where replaced with refurbished units.  My second issue involves the suction cup which is insufficent to hold the Nuvi properly onto the glass.  Do not use it at all cost.  Every car that it has been placed in the suction cup has failed and the Nuvi to my horror has come falling back to earth each time.  For between 600 to 1000 buck you would think they could provide a more secure mount.  The Dashboard mount that I have purchased works well.  The FM transmitter is not really a feature I would purchase the Nuvi for.  If you live in a city the quality of the audio is poor at best.  Bluetooth hand free communication is cool when it works and is not sending me false signals.  BE VERY CAREFUL the nuvi has a small list of bluetooth enabled phones that it can work with very small.  If I pair my phone with the Nuvi,  I get continious ghost calls to my Nuvi every 3 to 8 minutes where I have to tell the nuvi to ignore or it will just keep ringing for a bit.  I wish I could continue recommending the NUVI like I once did, but with all of the issues it's kind of a lemon.  I have worked around most of the issues and it's acceptable to use with many of it's key selling points disabled so my recommendation would be to save some money and purchase a cheaper model with just gps.  The Nuvi's bells and whistles are not worth the expense. I expect better from garmin really a let down.",1
576,"Not for Comcast / Motorola DVR users. Start off with the bad news.  I have a Motorola DVR / Converter box with my Comcast cable service, and the Comcast remote sends the ADS box into gonzo fits.  Attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ADS box to switch inputs.  Using the cable DVR fast-forward button cycles the ADS through screen formats with each button push, etc.  I contacted ADS tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time.Obviously, this is not acceptable.Too bad because this box does a much better job than my Philips Cineos at upscaling.  Tivo, analog cable, DVD, Laserdisc all look better.  The improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle, but definitely not worth it if you have a Motorola cable box that will conflict.5 stars for video quality, 3 stars for user interface (which is not so great), subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict.",1

I tried an Energizer charger, a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, and a RipVan100 Lightning Pack 4000N charger. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger, including diagnostics on batteries (voltage, etc., displayed for each battery).

Total of 2 weeks lost on that, I then called Samsung back, they dispatched a larger repair shop after numerous calls to schedule an appointment they finally came out two weeks later and couldn't fix the TV.  They told me I'd have to call Samsung for an exchange, Samsung agreed to an exchange. After a week, when no shipping company called I call Samsung back. I was informed the LNS4092DX/XAA is no longer available.  They agreed to ship a different model instead.  Long story short - 2 months later - still no TV - I spoke to them today 4/18 and I was assured that the shipping company has the TV (in spite of their denials) and that I would have the new TV in ... you guessed it.. 2 weeks.

586,"Not a quality product at all. First off the company I work for ordered three of these.  One out of the three did not work.  There is no sound comming from the right side and it isn't the speaker as we have tried different speakers.  Amazon will not take it back and will not exchange it for another one.  This is just the start.  The two that do work work very poorly.  The connecotor for the iPod is very flimsey and feels like it will break off.  They give you inserts to use depending on what model iPod you have.  These inserts prevent the iPod from sliding all the way down so when you use them the iPod will not work.  Also, the CD player has a lid that opens with a motor.  Yes, a motor.  So, if you push it down when it is open it will close but this throws off the gears as it is very sensitive and now the damn things don't close all the way.  You need to use the open/close button to prevent this but natural reaction is to push the lid down when it is open.  All of the buttons are very clumbsy and confusing.  The sound is not that great at all!  There are a TON of wires with this thing.  Power, speaker, antenna and iPod firewire type connector all run between the speakers, subwoofer and main unit. This is not a good product and has been a nightmare for my department.",1

It has several simple digital decode modes.A fair value for $100, but if I had to do it again, I would prefer a lower end home theatre receiver with speakers, which often start around $150.  These speakers show significant distortion at fairly modest volume levels.  However, they are adequate sound for my small home office at lower volumes",1

I have installed many Linksys products on my wireless network, and a few minutes of reading on the Linksys community forum revealed a good user install tutorial that worked just fine.

I had the unit sitting less than 30 feet from my router and was experiencing a large number of drop-outs, not to mention the fact that the music sounded like it was coming from under water.  I know I have the most recent firmware, etc.Many user forum comments indicate that one problem is network traffic.  Hello!?!?  If this product cannot work while my home network has other traffic then what good is it?I am not even going to bother with further trouble shooting.  I wanted to give this unit a try because it was cheap and I have all Linksys gear already.I have been down this path with other Linksys products, and typically if their product does not work out of the box then no amount of tweaking will really solve the problem.

Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and ""hope"" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters",1

606,"I was disappointed with this tuner and wound up returning it. At first, I looked forward to having one of the few HD tuners out on the market.   However, once I received the tuner, I was, sadly, disappointed.I had a couple of problems with the product, one which made it unusable for my use and I returned the unit.The first, fatal problem is that the power supply has a low frequency hum.   I purchased the tuner for a home office, and will sometimes work without any music.  I contacted the manufacturer hoping that it may have been a manufacturing problem, but they indicated that I should at least not hear the noise from ""across the room"".   Even when the tuner is off, it draws power for its clock and continues to hum.The other design issues that make the tuner slightly clunky:1) Accessing any of the presets requires pressing a preset button before a number making every station 2 buttons away.2) The width of the display causes most station/song titles to scroll, and to scroll slowly.   The slowness may be based on the RDS signal, but I would have preferred to see the text all at once",1

Terrible quality control.What's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty",1
610,"Low Life. At the same time that I purchased the Axion AXN6070A 7"" Portable DVD Player for my kids, I also purchased the Phillips PET824 8.5"" portable DVD player for myself. The Phillips is in a different league than the Axion, and if you're a traveler that will rely on the battery life of the portable DVD player, then you definitely don't want the Axion. The Phillips is a bit more expensive, but it has everything and more than you could want out of a portable DVD player.Both the Phillips and the Axion LCD screens are crystal clear. You lose a little definition as you move side to side (as with most LCD type screens), but nothing too drastic that would warrant a complaint. The Phillips PET824 has an 8.5"" screen and the Axion a 7"" screen. The 1.5"" difference is not dramatically different, but the larger Phillips screen does enhance the viewing experience.The sound is fair on both the Phillips and the Axion without headphones, but I don't think that the idea was to use the units without them. Sound is fabulous on the Phillips with a good pair of headphones, and just okay on the Axion; your iPod headphones will do just fine for either unit (and if you don't have a pair you'll need to buy one because the players don't come with any). Both have two audio output jacks, and a 3-way splitter (not included) worked fine on both so that 4 people could watch and listen at the same time with headphones.Here's the big difference between the two units: Battery Life.I've gotten almost 7 hours out of the Phillips' battery, and the Axion's battery gives you less than 2 hours. Therefore, if you're an airline traveler or just want to bring your player somewhere that you can't use either the car adapter or the DC adapter, then you absolutely don't want the Axion; you want the Phillips.On a recent airline trip the Axion--after a full charge--conked out after less than two hours...that's not even a full movie in most cases.The Phillips' battery is a bit bulky. You'd think that with today's technology they'd be able to slim it down, but you can't complain about the 6+ hours of life you get with it after a full charge. The Axion's battery is smaller and more lightweight than the Phillips, but what can you do other than watch a few SpongeBob episodes with less than two hours of battery life. The Phillips PET824 is good for at least 2 full-length features before charging and that's awesome for long trips where you can't use the DC adapter or car adapter.The car adapter on both the Axion and the Phillips work great and they both have long cords. So no need for the battery on car trips. The Axion at best might be a nice, less expensive alternative if you won't be taking your portable DVD player to places that require battery use.Both the Phillips and the Axion fit in my small briefcase, and they're both relatively light. The Axion is a feather compared to the Phillips. Amazon sells cases for the units that can mount on the back of the driver or passenger seats. The case I got also mounts in between the driver and passenger seats. I'd highly recommend a case for your player. I went with the Case Logic Koskin DVD Player Case.All in all....The Phillips PET824 was a much more satisfying purchase for me. For my purposes, the Axion just won't do for airline trips, and that's a major requirement; hence, the Axion is a major disappointment. But as I said earlier, the Axion is certainly a viable alternative if you don't mind sacrificing screen size and you don't plan on the need for battery power.Choose your view.",1

I find it strange that the Memorex DVD-RW reviews here are favorable, while at the same time the Memorex DVD+RW reviews complain of bad media.Last year I bought Memorex RAM disk as well as Memorex DVD-RW disks for use with my Toshiba D-KR2.  I believe I only had one bad disk out of 10 or so that I used.  They lasted over a full year of through dozens and dozens of recordings and eventually degraded, no complaints here and at that time I probably would have given them 4 stars.However I recently bought a pack of 5 Memorex DVD-RW and only 1 of 5 formated (hence the rating here).I also recently bought a pack of Fuji RAM disk and the first two I tried did not work and failed several tries at formating.  Unfortunately, I bought these at Best Buy which are notarious for their lack of customer service and they refused to accept returns on these.So, what's going on here?  Why are we letting these manufacturers get away with selling products that sometimes work in some machines and fail most of the time in others?  Where's the Six Sigma attitude when you need it?",1

626,"Buyers Beware!. Buyers beware!  I have never written or posted a consumer rating in my life.  I am so disappointed with Vonage's overall customer service; I feel that I have no choice but to warn others.Vonage in its own words does not guarantee the quality of its service. Vonage customers will experience: (1) dropped calls, (2) garbled communications, and (3) a non-responsive and dishonest customer service department.  The reason Vonage does not guarantee performance is because it knows that it cannot.  My first mistake was in believing the Vonage help desk, during my initial, ""30 Day Money Back Guarantee Period,"" when they told me my issues were due to line quality and not Vonage.  Since then, I have spent three months with Vonage and my High Speed Internet Service Provider's technicians attempting to make this service work. All speed tests indicate my ISP lines are fine.  I had a High Speed Internet Technician visit my house last week only to tell me everything checks out.  All this said, my Vonage phone has never worked worse.  I made a call today and the recipient could not even discern whom I was.  When I finally threw in the towel and decided that Vonage was not for me, I was hit with a $39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus the cost of the phone, despite a documented lack of performance from day one.Vonage's performance is substandard by any measure.  Closely look at all other options before bringing Vonage into your life and definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days to avoid the inevitable early termination fees.Make sure you read the below clauses in Vonage's Terms of Service agreement before you agree to anything.  A Vonage Customer Service Manager, Mike, sited these disclaimers when I told him that I was not satisfied with the service:(1)	""No Warranties on Service,"" section 4, paragraph 4;(2)	""Return of Device,"" section 2, paragraph 10;(3)	""Termination Fee,"" section 3, paragraph 6; and(4)	""Money Back Guarantee; Limitations and Conditions,"" section 3, paragraph 7.When I switched to Vonage, I was simply looking for a reliable telephone service and a company that stands behind its product and supports its customers.  Vonage's lack of line reliability and poor customer service has motivated me to document my experience.I had to call Vonage Customer Service on my old fashion landline because the voice quality on my Vonage phone was so poor that I would not be able to have a conversation.  After waiting for 20 minutes to talk to the Service Manager, Mike, I was told that I was contractually bound because I did not terminate my agreement within the first 30 days.  At this moment I thought of the stereotypical shady used car transaction.  I was lured to buy Vonage because of the promises of great service and all the free bells and whistles that only ""internet calling can provide.""  Instead I received a lemon, a phone that was unreliable and a company that did not stand behind its product.  While Vonage may get my $39.99 termination fee and the cost of the Vonage phone, I do not feel that I can just lay down about Vonage's failure to perform.  I feel compelled to (1) warn others about Vonage and hopefully save them the aggravation that I have experienced and  (2) Hit Vonage where it hurts, in the economic pocket book.  I am terminating my service as soon as possible.",1

Gain is too high and not adjustable, so when changing tfrom radio ro CD to ipod, it blasts you with volume and also the sound quality is compromised by the too-high gain.  It does not charge the ipod, nor can it be connected to a charger because it necessarily uses the docking port on the ipod.  Belkin makes (made?) a charger that plugged into the docking port and then   accepted an earphone jack from a separate tape.  The Belkin solution had a gain adjustment, which was very useful, but it was not possible to use the vehichle's tape/CD controls to control the ipod.  Using the tape/CD controls works for on and off, and it is great that the ipod stops when I switch to the radio or turn the car audio off.  Going to the next song or backwards works with a delay that is not terrible.  When I use the car controls I am in shuffle mode, so it's ok.  If I want to find a particular song, I pick up the ipod.  If the SmartDeck was had gain adjustment and a charger, it would be a lot better.  We really need to pop the ipod into a hole in the dash and control it completely from the dash, with all the ipod screen infor visible on the car stereo.  Until then, the SmartDeck is a couple steps forward and a couple steps back.  Becasue of the gain issue, I would not buy it again unless it had a gain adjustment",1

The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.",1
634,"Frustrating way to watch video. I had been using a Hauppauge MediaMVP Digital Media Receiver (Model 1000) and quite happy with this $99 device. I was able to play my recorded videos and show my vacation photos on a large screen but it died mysteriously and I thought I would upgrade to this more capable (or so I thought) device. I had lots of problems getting it working correctly and used it with 3 different media servers (both the one that came with the device and the Windows media server worked for me).I use the device primarily to watch shows I time shift from cable. There are two features that make this $200+ device far inferior to my previous device.1) The fast forward is ""fast"" in name only. Perhaps it doubles the speed but it does not seem that quick to me and I spend a LOT of time watching stupid ads. In addition to FF the Hauppauge had a feature that would skip 30 or 60 seconds at a time that made missing commercials a breeze. There is a ""jump"" feature but that lets you enter the total time into the clip you want to be so if it actually worked (it froze the device each time I tried to use it and I had to unplug it to even get the thing turned off) it would be a pain to use.2) When I had watched part of a video the Hauppauge remembered where I had stopped and offered to restart from that position. Image my frustration when I clicked the wrong green key (sending me to the video menu) about 2 hours into a movie. To get back to where I was I had to slow-forward for an hour to get to see the end of the movie.Who ever designed the software that the remote uses should be ...

They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue).I plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs.One last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo. It is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a Lenmar. Trust me",1

This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it.  I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA.  Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.  My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA",1

""Okay"" I thought, ""I must have got the one bad one..."" So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the ""radio stations"" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are ""just not tuned in right"" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the ""station fuzz"" goes away.

I then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup.  After 3.5 hours they failed.I decided that I'd return the items because I needed to get an alternative gift before Christmas and I didn't have time to find another way to get it installed.  I was able to return the D2, but the GEX-P10XMT and the IB100II  are not returnable.  It turns out that Amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies.

655,"Dangerous... I used a previous Olympus DVR model very happily for a year before losing it. I used to operate it while driving, taking notes, reviewing notes, erasing what I no longer wanted. The controls were easy and intuitive, and I could safely operate the device without looking at it. Not so this one. Overall, the controls are much less intuitive and it is down-right impossible to erase safely without looking.  If you do not pay close attention, you can easily erase the entire contents of the machine. This occurs if you inadvertently hit the erase button twice--which switches the function from erase entry to erase ""all.""  And believe me, it is all too easy to hit the erase button twice.  So I decided not to erase while driving. But then, last week, while being relatively careful (and while looking at the device; not while driving), I accidentally erased 38 voice files because I was not paying 100% attention. This item is dangerous if you value your recordings. Unfortuntely, it appears to me this and other control design defects have been built into the entire series of Olympus recorders",1

I had the Sony headphones which were similar to the JVC but I ran the ear bud over with my chair and crushed it.  So I thought I'd get something similar but a little cheaper.  I wish I had bought the Sony again.  These are ok, but everytime I move my head, I get static.  So unless I'm sitting very still, the sound quality is not that great.  Of course, when I am sitting still, they're fine and get the job done, but that pesky static every time I turn my head or move is very annoying.  I won't buy these again.",1

666,"Expensive, doesn't work with plain paper and ink is painful to find. The Epson R2400 is a purely Photo Printer. Be sure to understand this before you buy. So if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it  . . . think again. The K3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to Epson and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White printing quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my Epson R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. The biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the ink online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk ink tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 Inks will be imitated. IF you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. However at $850 I fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. I haven't been happy with this printer and I plan to replace it soon. Amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.",1

670,"Use it carefully. First of all, as proved by many computer experts, the performance Wi-Fi and 802.11x devices are far less reliable than 10/100/1000 Mbps 802.3 Ethernet NICs. If you decided to buy one 802.11b/g/n router in order to get the ""wireless"" convenience, be prepared to face the inconvenience of some new problems.I have used several brands and models of wireless routers (including Linksys, Belkin, and Netgear) in the past three years. None of them were perfect and I had to spend some time to figure out how to work around some technical problems. This one is my latest router and I have been using it for five months. I have to say, this one has many functions that I like, it is usable, but the reliability is not good.I really spent some time to find the firmware upgrade web page from Belkin, as the automatic upgrading function seemed not working. Belkin does not have a direct link from the product page of this model.The reason that I was trying to upgrade the firmware was that the router didn't support Wi-Fi constantly, and pushing the ""reset"" button or rebooting the router didn't always help. After the firmware upgrade, it still has some problems, including:- The web mode to configure the router does not work in many popular browsers such as firefox, if an administrator password is enabled. Every time after I input the password, it will report error. But thank God, I found Opera browser works in my Linux system.- Sometimes even though I set up the administrator password, I can still configure the router without inputting the password. This is definitely a security hole. The router doesn't support cookies. Instead, it uses IP address to recognize a user, but IP address can be customized easily by anybody who wants to initiate an attack.- The DHCP for WAN (Internet) does not work well all the time. When electricity is out for several seconds, it may take a long time to get the DHCP work. That means you may not be able to get online for 30 minutes even though your Cable or DSL connection is totally fine. To avoid this problem, I use static IP for both WAN (if allowed by ISP) and LAN.Since this router also has functions such as port forwarding and several WPA modes, which is much safer than WEP. I will continue to use it, but very carefully",1

Read about the others before buying.I was just called to a new client site last week that has 11 cameras installed.Of the 11, half at any given time will drop off the network and/or lock up. He was continually calling his exiting tech guy who performed the install to reset them and eventually called me in because he wasn't getting in his own words ""what he paid for"".I've used netstumlber and a few other apps to verify the wireless network health, which in my opinion is very good. At the farthest point, I am still receiving 92% signal with a non-enhanced Linksys router. Other devices on his network are problem free; the issues are isolated to the cameras.Short of recommending the client box them and send them back for a refund, I've emailed DLink for any opinions or aftermarket ""fixes"". They are running the latest firmware. I've tried to pick a few up on E-Bay to at least test them in a controlled environment, but spending $400 per camera when there are obvious problems would not be something I would be willing to invest in. It would be something I would be interested in since if they do work as promised, I could recommend them to future clients.My credentials, ex-NYPD officer and instructor, CCNP/CCDP CISSP, have a 10+ year networking business serving major Brokerage houses in Manhattan and have a smaller business auditing networks, recommending network security, and wireless solutions.I will follow-up if Dlink provides an actual solution.

Sorry, Ford Motors in 1908 wouldn't have survived if their Model-T failed to start ""most"" of the time.The cameras were boxed up and sent back. I was able to pull a few down and place them in a controlled environment for testing. Of the 3 I tested, 1 locked up within 24 hours. Not a good score.

They give you the mobile AND AC charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd. Other units using Bluetooth and USB (such as the 4-in-1 by Wintec) provide this.

Again, the problem was the device and not Skype.I bought an Actiontec Internet Phone Wizard instead and the noise was gone completely. So maybe I did get a defective unit, but either way there is probably some quality control issues with this device, or maybe all of them have the noise and some people don't notice. It's up to you to decide. With the Actiontec or DLINK, it will probably be much much clearer.Also, the people posting saying you cannot dial out if you do not have a land line are COMPLETELY WRONG. You download the latest software, right click the system tray icon and choose advanced, then change the default mode to USB instead of POTS. Then you can dial by doing:""001 areacode number #""This will dial skype from any phone...

Went to check my computer and found the KVM literally fried my MS keyboard and MS optical mouse (on PS2 adapter) - keyboard dead - MS mouse had a MELT MARK underneath (no joke!).Thier tech support is overseas (ergo: terrible), I sat on hold forever trying to get an RMA.  All I really wanted was to make them aware that this switch is possibly a manufacturer defect, and quite possibly a fire hazard.  They claim no one ever called to complain about it before.  Amazon's review section proved them wrong, and I told her so.I went with an IOGEAR KVM switch at half the price.  If that one dies I'm going with a hard wired KVM box for more money intead of these 'all in one' switch units, I think it'll be worth the piece of mind since I use my computers for a living at home.  I can't take the risk some junky cable could destroy my livelihood while I sleep.Linksys claims they never heard any issues with this unit overheating or melting down components, but if you search the web you'll find lots of ""my computer will not post, connected to Linksys KVM switch.""  This thing is overpriced garbage and a fire hazard as far as I'm concerned.  Avoid cheaply made overpriced junk like this",1
694,"Poor compatibility, poor customer service. Switch did not work with my Samsung 191T monitor. Customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful",1
695,"Pretty disappointed. I really wanted to like this product after reading the positive reviews found on Amazon, but to me the Cowon A2 left much to be desired.  I've been looking into purchasing a PVP for a long time but I've held out because I was waiting for the one that had all the features that I wanted namely:-An excellent music player-A player with recording capabilities built in-An Intuitive user interface-Excellent screen qualityThe Cowon A2 achieved 1 out of 4.Music quality is great on the Cowon, BUT, when I transferred songs over from my PC, there was a hiccup at the beginning of EVERY song.  Also, this device is not Play for Sure compatible, which was not a deal breaker for me. It would have been a nice feature to have, however, and I'm sure it will be a deal breaker for those who are suscribed to music services like Napster.The built in recording capabilities of the A2 were also subpar.  Although they advertise they have a high quality mic built-in to the device, recordings tended to sound scratchy when played back.  Recordings from a TV source were decent, but there are other devices like the Archos 604 that have the ability to record with s-video, and component cables, which I'm sure make a huge difference in the quality of the recording itself.Navigating the A2 was a nightmare for me as most of it is controlled by the annoying little thumbstick.  In order to make a selection, you have to click in the thumbstick.  Most of the time I somehow ended up backing out.  There's a trick to it and you might eventually get it but it was still very annoying to me.The one place that the A2 shined for me was in screen quality.  Videos that were transferred from my PC, (not recorded from a TV source), looked awesome.  Unfortunately, the very same video had horrific audio playback on the device.  Although there was no problem with playback from my PC, the audio when playing the video on the Cowon constantly skipped, and for all intents and purposes, ruins the video.If you are planning on purchasing a PVP, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  I personally think the Archos 604 would probably be better, but reading reviews on that product suggest music playback quality on that device is not that great.  So that would leave the Creative Zen Vision W, but THAT device does not have direct line-in recording... Sigh, I guess I'll have to wait a little longer for the perfect PVP",1
696,"Cool Radio, but an Awful Shortwave Radio. This is a nice radio. Cool design and nice to keep on your desk and use to listen to FM or AM radio stations. That's why I'm giving it two stars - because of design. If it wasn't for the the design, I wouldn't give it more than one star. The reason being that I expect a product (especially a Grundig product) marketed as a shortwave radio to actually be able to pick up some shortwave radio stations. I have had this piece for 3-4 years now, and I have still not been able to make it pick up a single shortwave radio station successfully. There are about three stations it finds, but barely. The signal it picks up is so weak one can't hear a single word. If you like a nice piece of very well designed radio to keep on your desk or nightstand, buy it. If you're looking for a shortwave radio, look somewhere else.",1

This thing sounded like a hair dryer. My wife asked me if everything was ok in my office because ""it sounds like something is about to launch!"" So I updated the firmware per the WD website to lessen the fan noise. Now the drive doesn't even mount! I call WD tech support. The first guy I talk to chuckles when I mention that the copy on the box claims this drive is ""remarkably quiet."" He said ""yeah, not this drive."" I get transferred to advanced tech support. We run some tests and determine that the firmware upgrade essentially killed this drive. I can't even get it to power up. Nice. Glad I transferred my iTunes collection to it. Guess I get to rerip all my cds.My advice? Look for something else. I have 2 other WD MyBook drives of smaller capacity that have worked just fine. This 1TB drive sucked from day 1.

I live in Venezuela and bought the keyboard through Amazon because he was cheaper than to buy it in my country and I thought that the quality of the product was superior.

702,"Muddy Sound. You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.1 - The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. They are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. These are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way!2 - The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back.3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. And in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). For some reason, this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver!4 - No user adjustable equalizer, only presets possible5 - Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the ""biamping"" type of connections.6 - The receiver sucks - even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver.I concur with the other reviewer - Death to Sony! Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride. This company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it ""Competively"" with the others - meaning - fat profit margins.",1

705,"Great when it works. I got this for Christmas in 2005.  I treated it with kid gloves, didn't use it everyday and was careful not to drop it and always unplugged it by gripping the plug and not the cable.  It worked perfectly until a couple of months after the warranty expired (Feb 2007), then one morning it simply failed.  I had copied a file to it to bring to work and when I went to transfer it to my work computer the next morning it did nothing. I tried it in four other computers with the same result.  Since the warranty was expired and Seagate won't repair it unless you have a service contract on it (see their website), I took it apart to see what I could do.  There is a microdrive that's easily removed.  I put it in my compact flash/microdrive reader and still it won't work.  If you use one of these don't keep important data on it that isn't stored elsewhere, which is always a good idea.  In theory this should have outlasted flash drives, but I have three flash drives that have lasted longer than this with more use and abuse.  I wouldn't recommend this",1

712,"Okay product, terrible instructions, but it DOES work on a Mac*. It took about 10 hours of work to make it function with a MacBook running OS X 10.4.6 and an Epson CX 6400, and I needed a windows XP PC to set it up, but yes it works.  For Mac installation, the trick is that (using the windows xp pc connected with wire - not wirelessly) you need to change the static IP of the server to a DHCP given by your router and then you have to go trial an error with your browser to find whatever address it was assigned.  On the Mac, set it up as an LPD printer.  Also, make sure you type the queue name exactly as it is shown on the status screen and God help you if you don't have one of the printers listed on the packaging",1

But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy.  My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems.  More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.Next time, I will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking (2-sided) and just as cheap",1
714,"Speakers stopped working days after warranty expired. I am an instructor.  I needed a speaker system with a very small profile for international air travel.  A friend of mine, who works for a major computer company, recommended these due to their size (though he did warn me the sound quality is average).The speakers are indeed small & light - and they conveniently fit into my computer bag.The sound is average, as I was warned.The UBS connection cable is too short - which is an inconvenience.But most disturbingly, the third time I used these they stopped working properly.  Unfortunately it was 2-weeks past my warranty period.  Their malfunction may have been a coincidence, but under the circumstances I cannot recommend these.  Even when they did work, the sound wasn't up-to-par.Do yourself a favor: look for an alternate model (there are many choices out there, in prices that range from $30 - $80).  Just remember to go with a USB-powered model (USB power is a MUST!)",1
715,Nasty Surprises. I've had the AT-PL120 turntable for about a month. It worked relatively well with the included cartrdge. There was some minor hum but it was only noticable with my receiver's volume up very loud with no record playing. I tried installing a Sure M78S cartridge for playing 78 rpm records and the problems started. There was noticable hum even when playing records. I also installed an Audio-Technica AT440MLa Cartridge. This cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies. The hum was outrageous from the second I turned the thing on. The cartridge works fine in my brother's old Kenwood direct-drive unit. I tried using the turntable with the internal preamp and with the one in my receiver as well as connecting directly to my Mac for CD burning. The problem persists. The unit will be going back tomorrow. Very Disappointing,1

717,"Slams the tape against either end; tape crinkled, could break!. We received our Kinyo UV-230C 2-way VHS rewinder/cleaner yesterday and tried it out today. The very first tape that we rewound (a much-loved Disney video) slammed against the beginning of the tape so hard that when we pulled the tape out it was hanging out of the cassette housing, crinkled. I'm afraid that repeated rewindings of a given tape could break the tape.I had a blank T-120 tape so I put that in and fast-forwarded to the other end to see if it would happen in that direction. It did. I rewound that tape to the beginning and this time it ended properly, so this problem is not consistent.The tape that was rewound initially was not a full 120-minute tape (the movie is 77 minutes long). I suspect that the sensors on the unit are calibrated for 120-minute tapes and will not necessarily treat shorter tapes as gently. (More tape = more weight = slower overall motor speed?) But I'm not going to experiment with tapes we want to keep! This unit will be returned ASAP. I may exchange it for another in hopes that this particular unit is out of whack.",1

I am glad that this was not our primary navigation unit ir we could have had some problems.  The unit would operate for a couple of hours then lock up and not operate until I had removed the batteries for an hour or so then reinstalled them.  New batteries did not help.  After seeing the comments about the slothful service support of Magellen I have returned the unit and will try something else.Overall the unit was pretty good and navigation to a benchmark was right on.  However, the map registration for the region of Utah that I was in was up to 200 feet off in some cases from the actual position.  This included a benchmark on a high point that the map showed to be under water.  Road and highway map registration appears to be accurate.Bottom line, if you feel comfortable with taking a new GPS to the field that may have reliability problems, or other users experience is different than mine, go for it.  Otherwise I would try another product or manufacturer at this time.",1

I bought the 32"" version which is attractive and worked great for 34 days-THEN the picture died although the sound worked-I called NIKO customer service about 10 times-finally I was told there where no service outlets available in my area for repair. I then was told I must ship it back to the distribution center in CA. at a cost to me of $75.00 through UPS. Next they received it according to UPS on the 7th of the month but denied having it there until the 23rd. Then they said it was delived to them with structural damage and there would be a charge of $70 which they changed to $160 2 days later. (I packed it great with lots of padding and UPS wouldn't have picked it up if it thought it wasn't). Now I am out $235 extra costs although UPS gave me $100 back for my damage claim without checking it out. They then sent me a supposed ""NEW"" replacement that only worked in black and white-no color in the picture. They offered a 3rd TV but after the first 2, I screamed and hollered, with no success at NIKO, but the Tiger Direct people were nice enough to return my money after hearing of my problems with the manufacturer.PS their remote sucks and you will find the no code works for your cable/satillite remotes so you have to use both-if you get a TV that works great, but if it breaks down---don't expect help",1

To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.

The picture was great until this weekend when I noticed vertical burn in lines whch approximate the boundaries of non-hd broadcasts. Samsung's tecnical department blithely notes such burn in is common and that it is never covered by warranty. The commercial hype by Samsung about their built in system to prevent burn in is just designed to sell the product as the technician admitted it does not really help. Samsung should be honest and let prospective purchasers know the real % of their sets which experience the problem. My friends have Panasonics which have never had the problem even after 3 years usage,1

727,"Good sound, terrible interface and buggy. I am returning this radio, even though the sound was very good and -- except for one difficult station -- the reception was also very good.I bought this to use as a bedside clock radio.  It has no real controls except those found on a poorly laid-out remote (the bose for some reason also just uses a remote only).  If you lose the remote, or even if you can't find it in the morning, you can't operate the functions.  Changing the clock time, changing the alarms or putting the radio into sleep mode all take endless button pushing on the remote.  It got very frustrating after a while, but because I liked the HD sound I had planned to keep it.That was before I found out that the radio alarm would sometimes just not go off.  Then the machine sometimes jammed up when setting the functions and refused to respond to the remote or the on and off switch until the unit was ""reset"".  Resetting the unit means unplugging it, unplugging it means you lose everything but your presets (you have to go through all the cycles to set the clock and alarms).  The final final straw that caused me to return it and find a new radio was when it started losing the signal from a local station (but not the sister hd stations transmitting on the same frequency).So, in sum, I liked the look, I liked the sound, I liked the hd stations, I hated the required remote, I hated the difficult and cumbersome user interface, I hated the buggy operation",1

As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish.  The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded.  For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same.  SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations",1

732,"This card is nothing more than a MMC. This card is nothing more than a MultiMediaCard (MMC). There are many options out there for purchasing MMC. Also, SecureDigital (SD) cards are fully compliant with the Palm Pilots for which this memory card is being marketed. At the time of writing this review, this was among the most expensive of comparable cards. In fact, yesterday at a local retailer I saw a 512MB (4x the capacity) for five dollars more.So my advice is that you do purchase expansion cards to take full advantage of the power of your Palm. I have purchased many and am able to use my Palm as an MP3 player (using RealOne), a video player (using Kinoma), an atlas (using Mapopolis) and a video game system (using PalmOne Sega Classic cards and downloaded games) all at the same time. Do buy SD or MMC cards to expand, but I would encourage you to comparison shop, looking for better prices.-Jacob Hantl",1

The 110 has the same good quality sound as the previous model, but it is smaller.  Even standing still, the headphones slip off of my ears causing me to constantly adjust them.  I don't know if it is the smaller size or angle of the headset, but the fact that it won't stay on my head makes it totally worthless.  I have many other kinds of headphones and have never run into this problem before, so it is a faulty design, not the shape of my head.  I would stay away from this model",1

The pioneer works OK, but looses lock easier, and the database is not as up-to-date as the Garmin. I recommend carrying a phone book with you, since the database doesn't have many newer stores and locations. It also doesn't take you as close to your destination. Sometimes, it stops directing you about a half mile away. Finding stores and points of interest is difficult without the address. It does do a good job of navigating on freeways, with very nice diagrams of each intersection. It also has XM Nav-traffic as an option, and I do like how it informs me when traffic is backed up. If you really need the XM radio, and traffic, I would consider this GPS. If navigation is your primary function, you will be much happier with a garmin. The data for the pioneer is still 1.0, and the replacement data disks are $250. I can only hope the updates will be more affordable",1

I have taken very good care of it (it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use) and used it several times a week while I teach.

Last week, the button froze in the ""on"" position, so it is now effectively useless. The laser diode still works, however.Also, the company offers ""Geek Points"" for future purchases that are supposed to be good for 36 months.

740,"Poor design, unstable, actually makes computer access difficult. I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock.  So I settled for this one.  That was a big mistake.  The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable.  The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU.  It is really a two person operation.

741,"Easy to use, but incredibly limiting. This kit is neat; I have to admit that.  It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book.  However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided.  The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself.  Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you.  You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want.  It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy ""scrap book"" elements that look absolutely ridiculous.However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises.

I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better.In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06.I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either.I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer.I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report.It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need!You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were.I'm going back to Sony, and let me tell you, Amazon Customer Service blows away just about every company I've dealt with (sorry about the preposition).

752,"Not as Good as $25 Philips SHE9500. I like Bose products.  I also think they are a good company, overall.  But these phones are simply mediocre in sonics.  Put them on, and they sound good enough.  But, they are inefficient and give the impression of clarity via softness.  They do not compare to $25 Philips SHE9500s sonically.  The Philips are incredible once you get the right sized ear bud on (of course, the same goes for the Bose--it is ESSENTIAL to ""find the bud for you,"" or you'll never see the merits to in-ear phones).  If you don't think that finding the right sized bud is important, try (carefully) using in-ears WITHOUT any buds on and you'll get tinny nothingness.You can tell the difference between these two makes by hooking them up via a large headphone adapter to a regular stereo system.  NO COMPARISON, the Philips are truly PREMIUM at c.$25 against the near $100 you serve up for the Bose.Again, these phones are GOOD.  At $25 they'd be a fair value--even so at just under $50;  still, they would not be as good as the Philips SHE9500s.  At nearly $100, the Bose are overpriced and, in my opinion, you are paying for all the TV advertising they do.  If you have money to burn, you can't go TOO wrong with the Bose--but you CAN do better.TWO STARS because they do work.  But since I now have five pairs of Philips SHE9500s, I doubt I will ever use the Bose again.  They are not a value.  For that, look to the Philips SHE9500s",1

Plug the iPod into the new Universal Dock, turn the iPod on, select a playlist, grab the remote, sit down in your chair, start playing music. Now, do you want to change playlists or adjust some other setting on your iPod? Well guess what? The menu button on the Apple Remote doesn't work with iPods. So you have to get up, go across the room to where the iPod is plugged into the stereo and change the settings on the iPod. So what can you do with this remote with an iPod. Well you can pause songs, you can increase or decrease the volume and you can skip back or forth through songs in a playlist. Basically this is the iPod equivalent of a 1960s TV remote control. It's a complete waste of money because you can't browse your playlists or change settings on the iPod.

I thought    I found the perfect lil headset, and I mentioned it to a friend who was also new to Skype and ordered one for each of us.Well, it came and like a kid in a candy shop I went at it.  The ear piece doesnt fit nicely, it was very klunky and uncomfertable - unlike those sony over-the-ears and some bluetooth headsets.

As I had iTunes playing some music, I right away heard the sound which was OK I suppose for a cheap headset, but not as good as basic earbuds...  Then I made some test calls, and no one could hear me unless I WAS YELLING.  I do not like to YELL everytime I am speaking to someone, and this piece of trash is being returned ASAP.Bottom line is, do NOT buy this.

773,"Very well built, but 2 bad flaws. Based on C/Net reviews, Amazon.com reviews and reviews by ilounge I decided to get the V55 versus the iFlip. The reviews I had seen on-line were fairly accurate, but I think [the reviewers] were too enamored with style over function.The V55 is very well built. It's solid, ipod integration is very nice, and there is excellent fit and finish. The speakers provide pretty good sound, and make a good portable system for use on the road. In fact, the reviews used this as one of the real descriminators. But when am I going to use this without headphones? For me at least, a better sounding audio system isn't as important on a device like this.  Additionally, the importance of an IR remote is over-sold for a personal device, at least for my personal use profile in airplanes and other vehicles.All else being the same - these would have been selling points for the V55. However, all else is not equal. There are two flaws which are driving me to return the product:1) No 4:3 aspect ratio selection. Now many posters at ilounge had discussed this issue, and recent posts claimed this problem was fixed with a menu selection, but the unit I bought on Dec 30, 2006 does not allow selection of 4:3. I sent multiple messages to SI and received a response from Nick stating that there was not a firmware fix available for the unit. That leaves only a few possible conclusions:a) There is no fix and the few posts of a fix are 'planted'b) There is a fix in new units, but the vendor is unwilling to offer a firmware upgradec) There is a fix and there is no way to upgrade the unit's firmwareC) is the most likely scenario, but in any case it's a deal breaker. To me - watching i-tunes downloaded video in 'wide-head' mode is simply not acceptable for a product in this price category. I don't mind re-ripping my DVDs with the proper wide screen aspect ratio, but there is no way to play native 4:3 video without video stretching.2) The V55 battery doesn't provide power to the ipod. The ipod battery drains as the V55 system is being used. The cheaper competition keeps the ipod battery topped off, so when the video system drains you still have a fully charged ipod for your portable use. Also if your ipod battery is drained you cannot use the V55. Again, not so with the cheaper competing product.I'll do my wrap-up by repeating the V55 is a very well built product. It's look and feel is very nice, and if I didn't have to contend with issue #1 I would probably live with issue #2. However, there appears to be no way to assure you'll get a unit with the firmware upgrade (if it exists).I cannot recommend the V55",1

Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested.

The CanoScan software is quick, easy to use and is the same software used on almost the entire Canon line.  Scanning documents in B&W take less than 10 seconds on default dpi settings, which is pretty good for a budget scanner.The one thing I can't stand is the horrible screeching noise the scanner makes when documents are being scanned.  It's so bad, that I have to plug my ears while using it...how can I describe it?  It's not a loud noise; it's not a noise that will cause permanent damage, but it IS a screech that gives you that scratching-chalkboard effect.  The first few times I used it--no big deal.  However, the first time I had to manually feed 4 or 5 pages in a row, I had enough.I think the scanner is so thin and compact, it just doesn't have the housing or the insulation to muffle the noise.  Maybe my ears are too sensitive and I can hear dog whistles too, but it's really bloody annoying.I might just have to splurge on a quieter scanner before I go crazy.  I'll ask my boss to reimburse me...he's great like that.Like I said, love the scanner, hate the noise",1

I didn't really need the printer, but the price was great for the computer/monitor, and the printer was basically a freebie. I hooked up the computer system. I thought about the printer I already had. It was older and jammed once in a while when I was printing, so I decided what the heck, I'll hook up the new printer. I unboxed it and was starting to hook it up. I looked for the USB cable. I couldn't find it. Started examining the styrofoam packing materials to see if it was shoved in some crevise or other. No cable. Then I looked on the instructions, and the show the contents of the box (printer, power cord, cartridges, and docs/software). They didn't show a USB cable. On the outside of the box, they also show contents. And in tiny little print it says ""USB cable not included"". What kind of cheap manufacturer doesn't include a USB cable with a USB printer? It's not like I have a choice of whether to go USB or parallel. The printer ONLY does USB. Without a USB cable, the printer is a paperweight. In order to use this printer for anything, you will HAVE TO buy a USB cable! Why didn't they include one? It is just stupid",1

I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static.Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING.  During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior.This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.  If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs.  If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried.Sirandar",1

816,"Disappointed in 1GB XD Picture Card (Type H). I purchased this card to use in my Fujifilm Finepix S5000 camera for a family vacation.  I had researched it beforehand to make sure I could use this card in the camera.  There is an ""H"" and an ""M"" card (apparently, they save things in a different format and the ""M"" card does not allow for taking videos with this camera).  I purchased the ""H"" card, and used it mostly to take still photos.  Upon returning home and downloading the photos (505) to my computer, I was extremely disappointed to find that once I had copied them to my computer, I was unable to view them on my camera anymore (and I did not choose to erase them from the card).  I got an error message on the camera, and my only choice was to format the card (which meant everything would be erased).  I wasn't happy, but I couldn't view the photos anyway, so I did format it.  That was one problem.  The other problem I had was that several of the photos were displayed as question marks on my computer, with no image at all.  Others looked fine in the thumbnails, but when opened, the top half of them was fine, but the bottom half was either solid gray, or spliced and repeated.  It was crazy!  These are memories that can't be recaptured, so it was very upsetting.  I do not trust the card at all, and I will not purchase another one!",1
817,"Returned in 2 days. I returned this product in exactly 2 days.  My bad for not doing the research and looking at reviews.  I bought this based on the store demo and the Bose name and reputation.  The promise of an easy hookup, minimal wiring and only 2 speakers had great appeal to my wife.I could not get video on some of my DVDs (which apparently a common complaint on the boards) and those that did get video were very pixelated.  The sound played off my cable TV was very uneven.  The unit utilizes S-Video and has only 1 optical input and 1 coaxil input.As soon as I read the reviews, it was clear that this product has been less than stellar and for $1000, I was not taking chances.  My $65 DVD player does a better job with an HDMI hookup, my old receiver (purchased in the late 90s) has more optical inputs and I stuck it out with my old system as unsightly as that seems to my wife.I think there is a market for this type of product, but poor execution here by Bose.",1
818,"Direct Turntable Connection Too Weak. I attempted to use this cable with the Griffin iMic to connect my turntable directly to my G5 iMac and import some of my old vinyl LPs.  However, this setup was not able to produce anything close to satisfactory recordings, despite tweaking the settings in the Finyl Vinyl software provided with the iMic and the Mac's Sound control panel.  The recorded signal was very weak, even with input gains maxed out, and even worse there was an intolerable amount of white noise (sound like rushing air) in the recording.  The signal coming out of the turntable is simply way too weak to provide a decent signal for recording without a preamplifer in the setup.  I connected the turntable to my old stereo receiver, and plugged the iMic into one of the receiver's tape recorder outputs,  and voila--lots of signal strength and very clean recordings, no white noise whatsover.  Direct connection of the turntable to the computer would have been more convenient, but the results are not satisfactory to even a casual listener, (such as myself).

820,"Basic functionality, and that's about all. I bought this router hoping that some of the quality in Cisco's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child Linksys.  Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that Linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent.That being said, the router does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers.  My perusals of the DSL reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception.Pros:This router is configured to work right out of the box.  You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen.The HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use.  You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router.Default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective ""black hole"" on my IP for most uninvited packets.Cons:Not all of the features worked out of the box.  Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything.  Strange that Linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything.Turning on the poorly documented ""firewall"" feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests.  Sometimes the router responds ""port closed"" to all requests.  Sometimes it responds ""port closed"" to some and ""port open"" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next).  Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with ""firewall"" inactive).  I'm not sure how the ""firewall"" in this router is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature.The router's DHCP functionality works great -- when it works.  It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy.Flashing a new BIOS image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out.For what it's worth, I am still using this router.  It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them.  I probably will not buy another Linksys, but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return.-sean hennin",1

The box itself is much larger than just the dock, and the price would lead you to believe that you are getting more than just a piece of plastic and ceramic that helps your Mini stand up on your desk.Here's the joke, the dock is absolutely nothing more than a stand for your Mini.  It comes with no cabling and it does not come with an AC adapter (that is another $40!) Apple makes sure that you can't get any idea of what you are buying until after you have purchased it and broken open the packaging.At best Apple Computers has failed to adequately inform the customer of what they are getting or not getting with the iPod dock and at worst the are neck deep in deceptive trade practices.People always tell me that Apple Computers understands their customers.

So I am using those analog 5.1 outputs to the receiver (atleast from the cabinet  to my desk its usb so my mission is half accomplished) but hey wait...One more shocking thing I noticed is that the volume control is in no way co-ordinated, which means that as you turn the volume each speaker is incremented/decremented unevenly!!! Takes place subtle so you dont notice it much but if youre into very low-decibel listening you will certainly pull your hair over this.Overall an ok card if you like decent looks.

After many hours of watching the DVD flash, finalizing.   I tried to turn the DVD off, it wouldn't turn off.   I ultimately had to pull the plug and of course the DVD was useless.   This has happened seven times over the last weeks.   Now, before using the recorder, I clean it with a Laser lens cleaner....and still, yesterday, I put a disk in just to play it and it kept spinning out of control.    It sounded as if the machine was eating up my disk.    I again, couldn't turn the unit off, or eject the DVD.   After about ten minutes and pressing many buttons, it stopped.    I was able to eject the disk, and it wasn't damaged, but it really confused me as to why this happened.     I have had many other brands of DVD recorders that turned out to be poor quality also, even if I paid over $200 for them.   I now keep a journal of problems with my recording equipment as it is costing me quite a bit to record anything.  Only good point about the Sony DVD recorder is it does record a very good picture.

879,"Shoulda read the reviews. I got two of these as a gift and right out of the box I had problems with them.I've owned 2 P880's (the corded versions of this controller) for over 2 years now and they are great, the included software for Saitek controllers is brilliant as well. The controllers are well designed and fit comfortably in my hands, they're like the perfect balance of Playstation and XBox size. The only downside is that they only have 1 shoulder button instead of 2, but you get used to that.So why not go wireless?Well the only reason I wouldn't recommend these is that the batteries are very poorly designed. Saitek has even recocgnized this on their site and will ship you a free pair of batteries. I got mine a couple weeks ago.However that still wont solve the problem and like most reviewrs I've tried and tried to get these pads to work with little to no avail.The individual battery packs actually contain 2 batteries inside; one for the wireless connection and one for the controller display.The problem is that if one baterry is full when the other is not the charger will not continue to charge the drained battery. so while you may get a display on the controller, you wont get a connection to the PC or vis versa.There is no easy solution to this problem either. The user must find a way to drain the batteries without damaging the battery pack and hope that they stay in sync after that (which is very unlikely).If you really like Saitek (like me) I'd wait for a newer model of wireless controllers. Till then stick with the cords or go with a different brand.As of this date Saitek has seemingly started to release newer versions of their game pads so hopefully there's a more functional version out there soon if its not out already.Be warned that the 2.4GHz version of this pad is prone to the same problems",1

897,"Another example of marketing hype... ...designed to lift money from the wallets of the American public.  If one is to transmit digital signals like those that come from the back of DVD and CD players reliably, 100% shielding is a basic requirement. This cable is not 100% shielded; look for foil in addition to the copper braid. Further, digital signals don't care about super low resitance or impedance.  If the bits get there, the amplitude is incidental once a sufficient level is achieved.  Over a distance of &gt;10feet, big and fat are just to make you feel good about spending $40 on a $5 piece of hardware. *see below for a possible exception to this.  Thirdly, if you don't have balanced electronics, what difference could an unbalanced cable with RCA interconnects make? RCA connectors will never be 75ohm connectors; they will never be balanced.  The arrows are mostly to make you feel good about your purchase.  Usually it simply indicates the company specs that any drains are attatched at the end to which the arrows point.  If you have such a grounding problem as to cause interference in your playback, an RCA will never cure anything. As a feel good genuflection to the audiphile gods, attach all your arrowed interconnects with the arrow pointing the same way.    And lastly, look into VSWR and how the design of this RCA affects it.  The large diameter of this cable and therefore the diameter of it's dielectric might help here, but if you can see the solder job, the chance of unhealthy levels of VSWR is greater in that once the signal reaches this RCA, the differences between the RCA's shielding, and other properties, and the properties of the coaxial cable are sudden and definite.

If you only use the clock for weekend trips this probably won't be much of an inconvenience, but for longer trips or regular use at home, this is a bit of a nuisance. I can honestly say that in my entire life I have never had any clock, watch, or other appliance so poor at keeping the correct time.I have also been disappointed with the quality of the Indiglo backlight on this clock. On my last travel alarm, as well as my Indiglo watch, the Indiglo backlight is bright and makes the characters easy to read in the dark. However, on this clock the Indiglo backlight is feeble by comparison. It's just bright enough to qualify as usable, but if your eyesight isn't great the combination of the weak backlight and the fact that you probably aren't wearing contacts or glasses in the middle of the night may make this clock difficult for you to read.As far as the user interface is concerned, the time display is very large, but other on-screen items, such as the ""alarm on"" indicator, are not necessarily obvious by a quick glance at the display. The Indiglo button, as you can see in the picture, is in the middle of the face of the unit. My last travel alarm placed this button on the top of the unit. If you can imagine trying to illuminate your clock in a pitch dark room, you can probably guess which location is more convenient. Fortunately, all the buttons you need to set the clock are easily located on the lower half of the face of the unit. For setting the time/alarm the clock has a pair of up/down buttons that move the time in one (if you press and release) or 15 (if you hold) minute increments. This is particularly useful for making small time adjustments backwards.Overall I have been very disappointed with this clock. It lacks some of the ease-of-use features I'm used to, and it suffers from poor craftsmanship. It was relatively inexpensive and it hasn't technically broken, but if I could go back in time I would most certainly purchase a different travel alarm",1

Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine",1

913,"the nays have it. Been working with mine for about a week, and am disappointed to report that the negative reviews are spot on.I too had trouble linking it to the PC. Ran into the hardware flow thing. Easy enough to solve after an email to customer support, but they were vague enough that someone less experienced with the windows device manager might have trouble.But the main reason I don't like it is that scanning is slow and not accurate enough. Really, you're better off with dragon speaking naturally, or just typing.The whole thing feels like it's 15 years behind the times. The interface is horrible. The PC connection is deadly slow. The software is junk. (Can we at least import notes into a text file? WTF is a .qnt file? Now I've got to screw around getting that into a program I actually can use!) One really has the sense that these guys aren't putting any effort into keeping up with technology. These guys should look at an iPod. Given how much they skimped on everything else (program, connectivity, interface, screen, memory, chip, etc) I have no reason to think that this is a particularly good scanner.A friend of mine has a C-Pen 20. That scans much faster, but has to be plugged in. C-pen used to sell portable versions, but I emailed their American distributer and found that they only have the wired one.Total disappointment. As a graduate student, this device could have changed my life. Instead, it'll sit in a drawer, reminding me of the money I blew on it.Bottom line: useles",1

This was sent from Nextar as a replacement for a defective MacVision MP3 I ordered for my daughter, it took 3 weeks to send in the original(they don't return calls in 48 hours as their voicemail states) and then it took another 3 weeks for them to get me a replacement(which was a step down in price and options from the one it was replacing).  For about a week this player worked and then it started to do the same things the original did(would not play a full song and then goes into a starting 'loop').  I would not buy another product from this company",1
917,"Not as good as my 8 year old Wacom. I wanted to get back into digital painting recently and so I planned on buying a new tablet and upgrading to Painter iX. Along the way of researching what new tablet to buy I ran into this brand and after seeing all of the positive reviews on this page I decided to give it a try. I was very disappointed. I have an 8-year old Wacom Digitizer II (its so old that Wacom doesn't have a single reference that it ever existed), but I assumed that my Wacom was less sensitive compared to the newer models even from non-Wacom makers. The real catalyst to buying a new tablet was that my new computer doesn't have the serial port that the Digitizer II uses (I told you that it was old.)I plugged in the Cyber Tablet and played with it for a while and I just couldn't get into it. It doesn't have as smooth a surface as the Wacom, plus the pen is almost twice the thickness. The worst part by far is the sensitivity differences between the two; when you lightly drag the pen across the surface it doesn't always create a light line, instead its very inconsistent. I adjusted the sensitivity levels for a long time and never found a setting that solved this problem. The construction is reasonable, but it certainly doesn't feel as quality as the Wacom.At this point I am sending back the Cyber Tablet and keeping my Wacom Digitizer II, even though it is a little banged up and I have to buy a USB-to-Serial converter to make it work. I was really excited about this lower-cost tablet after reading the previous reviews, but I am not convinced that any of them have used a Wacom before or compared them side-by-side. A Wacom tablet from 8 years ago (think 486 processors, floppy disks & serial mice) far exceeded the quality, sensitivity and usefulness of the new Cyber Tablet 12000",1

926,"Don't buy this shredder. If I'd read the reviews here for Fellowes shredders before buying one, I would have stayed well clear.  As it was, I needed a cross-cutter saw this one (P70CM) on sale and bought it.  It jammed on day 1.  It has jammed numerous times since.  Although the capacity states 7 pages, you're better off shredding just a couple of pages at a time, but be warned that they recommend the unit can only operate for 2min at a time due to shoddy engineering.  6 months after purchase, a document caused it to jam resulting in the motor shearing the teeth off the internal nylon gears (for an extra 10-cents these could have been metal...).  The other point is the wire basket which at first looks stylish, but oozes paper dust, and emptying is a struggle as the shredder jams into it - this requires some effort to dislodge which causes you exert and bend the metal basket even more etc.etc.  This shredder has now joined its own output.

This is not the first PNY 256 to do this to me, i gave one away previously in frustrastion thinking it was my computer, it was not. I tried to call there tech support but at first it gave me only the option of where to buy their products when i called again it was closed and offered no info on SD memory. I went online and looked for support for SD but wouldn't you know they don't have any FAQs on it. I tried to write them an email on it but there mail server crashed and my 10 minutes of typing to there tech support was in vein. I have read that many others have recieved cards that didn't work when they got them or failed after 1 or 2 erase cycles. IN SHORT don't by PNY, spend the extra money and get something that will work, if it doesn't work i don't think tech support will help you, if you want to roll the dice and take a chance and something that probably wont work than PNY is for you. If you don't believe me call their tech support 18002344597, you try to ask them about there fine SD memory, go to their website to, see what they have to say about there fine products, spend the 5 minutes to look into it before buying it on impuls",1

932,"Unusually I discount negative reviews... Usually I discount negative reviews.  I think people may have sour grapes against a company, or not understand how to install or work something.  I somewhat tech savvy - I installed our wireless network that took a little doing.  I work as a technical recruiter, so technology doesn't intimidate me.  I like technology.So I had been nudging my husband for a print server so that I could print without going to the printer and plugging in.  He came home with this Belkin product and went about installing it.  Usually I like to research before I purchase a product, but he wanted to handle this.So, he installed it, and I went back and checked his work, and he had followed the instructions exactly.  I know he had some trouble, and had called tech support at my suggestion - I would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support.  The only problem is, that the printserver doesn't work.So, I tried installing the software on my pc, and trying to problem solve from there.  I called the tech support hotline back, and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time.  I waited for 2 hours, then went out to run some errands.  There was still no message from a technician when I returned.This morning my husband needed to get some work done from home.  He created a document, and knowing that the print server did not work, he wired up to the printer to print that way.  But now, the printer won't respond to the signal, so he can't print that way either.  So we deleted the Belkin software and rebooted the computer.  He still can't print.So, I went back to my PC, and tried to delete the software through the control panel.  It won't delete.  I am getting an error message.  I can't print either.So now I am on hold with Belkin customer assistance.  Maybe it's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is, I swear I hear a little Indian accent.  That doesn't mean that customer support has been outsourced to India, and even if it is, that doesn't mean customer support is bad.  But my experience with this is that while I can get a real live person on the phone, he can't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back.  When I tried to get my problem escalated, I overwhelmed him and he put me on hold.  I am still on hold.  I have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight.I called back from my cell phone, and someone who sounded so much like the first operator I spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician, and someone would call back in 1-2 hours. When I strongly protested, asked for his name, asked for a number I could call directly, he offered to transfer me immediately, and now, I have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone.I am starting to sense a trend here. My husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document, has gone off to work to print it there. I am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo, waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call.I usually discount negative reviews, but this is really my experience with this product, and if you are considering purchasing it, I would encourage you to think that through a little further.",1
933,"What, secure?! You have to be an administrator!. I am giving this unit the lowest possible score for the reasons below.  The fact that this is product by Lexar is actually named ""Secure"" invokes the belief it really is secure.  However, I have been discussing this with Lexar for over two weeks now, without resolution.The problem is that the Encrypted Vault (the reason I purchased the thing) is not available except when signed in as an administrator.  Hello??!!  Why would Lexar build a unit that is smaller than some earrings my girlfriend wears if they did not expect it to be used as a portable device, meaning it would be used in many different computers?  So, if you go to the library, or at work on a network, or at your friend Billy's house, and you are not the administrator, YOU LOSE!   The only way around this is to put your most sensitive material right on the public drive, and not use the secure features of the drive.  Does that make sense?I was sent the software version by Lexar with no improvement, and have tried all of their suggestions, and now the unit will display the Microsoft Windows error screen and shut the drive down.To be fair, if you do not need to access sensitive material on any computer (without admin rights) then this unit could work for you.  It works great on my home computer, but I just have to admit that with a PORTABLE device I tend to want to PORT it around and use it on other machines and cannot.If you need to access your data on many machines, and wish to do so without admin rights, beware!  I suggest you look at the Lexar website and contact them to make sure this is possible.  I'm still wrestling with them, and am hopeful I can take them to the mat and pin them, and will be able to actually use this storage device as advertised.",1

With the Microsoft website clearly mentioning MacOS X functionality, I purchased this mouse for my iMac - fully intending to use the built-in Bluetooth for keyboard and mouse (no wires, free up a USB port).This mouse will not pair with the built-in Mac bluetooth (MacOS X 10.4.8).

I called customer support and was told I would be called back by a technician (which obviously the first person was not) within an hour. We waited...and got online to try to figure things out. Turns out that in VERY small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 GH wireless (802.11b/g) to work. I was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $16 a piece, which makes Cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $500 router.Although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me, since I registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful. I really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need. I still haven't used this router since I'm waiting for the required antennae I had to order somewhere else. Cisco routers are supposed to be good, but as a warning to you, the potential customer, be aware that 1) you need to purchase external antennae with this product; 2) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing",1

938,"2 major design flaws - Buy Kensington version instead. I purchased this product, but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away.The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder!  The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress, the solder breaks.  You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection.  I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter.The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall, it would cause my laptop (IBM T20) to emergency power off.  Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine.  I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter.I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter.  It looks almost like the same product (same OEM?) except they have stronger power tips.  It also didn't have the power-off issue.I loved the form factor, but the product just didn't work",1

It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist.Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones.AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something.I think thats about it...

Same problem.I then read up on user reviews and heard there are line-of-sight issues, so I tried plugging the USB receiver in to different ports on my computer.

( MY local Apple vendor and repair facility advised me not to use the download. They did not want to try it as well). The product vendor was reluctant to provide a refund.

Then, within about three hours of owning it - after less then ten pictures - something had gone awry. The zoom lens was stuck, it wouldn't move and an error message kept appearing. Then, the camera would shut off. That's when I referenced the manual and found out that it wasn't a fixable error. It had to be fixed by the manufacturer. I guess I know why I couldn't find a new one on-line, and why there were so many refurbished. I still really like Fuji cameras, but I wouldn't trust this model, especially a ""recertified"" one.

I've got quite a bit of experience with scanners, and was very happy with my slim Canon, but I wanted to scan negatives, so I picked up this item on a whim, thinking I could trust HP to make a decent scanner. That's the last time I'll make that assumption!I am using it with my iBook. I downloaded the most recent software from HPs website, which I recommend, since the software that ships with it is terrible.I am primarily interested in the negative scanning feature. I am disappointed. The scanner is slow, slow, slow, slow. Takes forever to warm up and scan. When it finally scans, the images end up either underexposed or overexposed, but never correctly exposed. I'll have the print in front of me, and it looks nothing like the version of the photo the scanner generated from the negative. I have tried tweaking various options, but to no avail. Besides, you shouldn't have to tweak a lot of options to get a decent exposure out of a negative that you know is correctly exposed.The Mac software is somewhat bloated and poorly designed. There are ELEVEN different applications installed where only one is required. iPhoto already does everything 99% of people need to do and comes pre-installed on every Mac. Why is HP trying to replace iPhoto? To make their product easy to use, they should do one thing: scan. Let iPhoto take care of the rest.I just tried to scan a photo while composing this post, and am sorry to report that the software is non-responsive and won't launch, either by double-clicking the application or by pressing the buttons on the front of the scanner. What a fiasco.I am going to try to install the scanner on my PC and see if the results are any better, but I am not optimistic, especially given the other reviews of this product.So, I am disappointed and am now considering spending considerably more money on a true film scanner.Bottom line: AVOID",1

And when I went to buy a new one they were priced around $80, $90 and up.I went with this cheapo item and paid about $36 hoping that if I lose it or get it stolen again it wouldn't be a big deal.  Now I'm begging someone, please take it.  I used it for a few days and did not like the difficult screen menus. You have to scroll with a toggle switch several times just to get to a menu that enables you to play music.  The toggling is not intuitive and you have to jar it several times before it actually moves once.  The view is less that an inch tall and so you really can't see what your playing.Long story short before anyone got a chance to steal this one it stopped working completely in a couple of weeks.

Often it didn't.So I contacted their customer service, and updated the firmware as instructed.  The problem was still there.  So I returned it to Cowon, and they insisted that the player was fine.I sincerely doubt that random electronic noise is a feature, but once they say that there isn't a problem I don't know what else to do.

I didn't think that was fair and tried to return it to the local reseller after my 30 days from the original sale was up. Luckilly the reseller took the radio back and refunded my money. Two bad radios just a fluke? Maybe so. But why penalize the the customer and ask him to eat the cost of shipping to fix Eton's problem?

The cable simply doesn't work.  Because the terminals are not ""split,"" they do not hold tight on the connections on the video component.  You put them on and they just slide off.  This was the case on both a new DVD player and a cable box, so it wasn't a question of the video component being out of spec.  Monster should pull this off the market and fix the design defect",1
1017,"Poor sound quality. I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good.I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string ""telephone"" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly.The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly.I returned the receiver and both kits the next day.",1
1018,"Nuulooq, not so hot. I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today.  One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click.

There may be a device out there that will someday ""revolutionize my workflow"", but this isnt it, Back it goes...",1
1019,"Better players are out there. As a heavy gym user who has sweated several MP3 (and headphones) into the trash, I thought this was the answer. But after using it for several weeks, I hate the thing. My biggest gripes:1) The Sonic Stage program seems not to be able to find and import the vast majority of .wma format files that I have never had a problem using on my other players. The program seems like a shill to force you to use Sony's Connect Store. Cheaper MP3 players allow you to drag and drop files direct to the player, I don't want another program just for this device.2) The entire industrial design of the player depends on one small keyway on the back of the plastic case, which in my case was deformed after one week and would no longer hold the player in one position. Without the keyway, you have a round player that is free to spin in the round holder which make this impossible to use without tying up both hands.3) Even when the keyway was working, the controls are not easy to use when you are working out. The armband positions the player so that the rear of the twist knob digs into your arm and makes it hard to navigate the controls with one hand while running.It is almost like no one actually tried to use this while running in the design phase. This is a case of a cool looking industrial design that does not serve the market it was meant for, avoid this player!",1

1025,"Gone are the days of solid HP printers. I have owned the printer for one year.  The only reason I gave the printer two stars was because when it prints (only reliably printing via USB) the pictures are beautiful.  The copy, scan, and fax features work.  I have not used the duplex.If you want to print via a network, then almost all print jobs will sponsor an error message, ""This document failed to print.""  A single print job may eventually print out with multiple error messages and printing line by line with many pauses during the printing process.  I usually cancel the print job, drag the USB cable to the PC I want to print from and restart the print job.When first purchased, I made multiple calls resulting in many hours on the phone with technical support.  Mostly they suggested that I reinstall the HP software. The last call asked I reinstall Windows which I was unwilling to do.  A few months ago, I did however purchase a new HPdv9000t notebook and freshly installed the HP pinter software on it, which did not work.  (Love the notebook by the way.)

1026,"Well constructed, Very Low Volume!!. This is a very well constructed cable, and is probably one of the best mini-to-RCA Y cables.  However, I have found the sound from the iPod to the receiver/amplifier to be VERY low; much much lower than the signal from a CD player (1/5 of the CD output loudness).  This forces you to turn the sound level way up, both on the iPod and on the receiver/amplifier, consuming lots of battery power on the iPod.  If you have a low power receiver/amplifier, you may not be able to play it loud enough.  The sound quality is adequate, but not great, as one can expect for this type of Y cable, regardless of build quality.  I also purched the NYCO iPod Stereo Link for comparison, and the sound quality is much better with a much louder output volume (3x louder than the Monster mini-to-RCA cable).  The NYCO is also more power efficient as it drains much less power from the iPod.  It does not go through the mini-jack, and also bypasses the volume control (a good sign if you care about sound quality).If you don't need to recharge your iPod while you play though the cable to a receiver/amplifier, I would definitely go with the NYCO Stereo Link Cable.

This is not yet tested by me, but is at least promising.Device is here:http://www.smarthome.com/4816b2.htmlExplanation is here:http://www.smarthome.com/images/4816dgm_big.jp",1
1033,"Poorly designed. I bought this case for a few reasons: I wanted something that fully protected my iPod from scratches; I wanted something that would not interfere with the aesthetics of the iPod; and I wanted a case that was fast and easy to get the iPod into and out of. The Dioshield performs fantastically on all three counts.Nonetheless, the case only rates 2 stars, as there are some significant design flaws. Before I discuss these flaws, however, I should mention that the hold button problem that others have mentioned in their reviews appears to have been resolved. My case arrived a few days ago, and the cut out for the hold button was more than large enough to allow free and easy access. If I want to, I can use my thumb to engage or disengage the hold switch while the iPod is in the case. However, this does bring us to the first of the aforementioned design flaws: the cut-out hole for the headphones. It is, admittedly, the perfect size for the jack on the Apple ear-bud headphones. However, I have Shure E2C's, which have a slightly wider jack, and they were not able to fit through the Dioshield's headphone cut-out. So if you have after-market headphones, especially ones with a 90 degree angled jack, or one that is particularly thick, you may run into compatibility issues. More alarming, the jack on my AV cord wouldn't fit into the headphone cut-out on the Dioshield, either, meaning that I'd need to take the iPod out of it's case if I wanted to watch a show on my television. I managed to work-around this problem by enlarging the hole with a Dremel, but still... it is annoying, and if you don't have a Dremel, or are reluctant to take it to your new case, then you might be s.o.l. when it comes to AV cables or better quality headphones.Okay, onto the second design flaw. I'm just going to quote a fellow reviewer, H. Park, who articulated this problem most succinctly and clearly: ""The bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync/charge cable. However, because of the proximity of the hinges, it's almost impossible to use the Apple-provided USB sync cable, since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug. Once the sync cable is inserted and the lock engaged, a narrow object like a knife blade or ruler is required to disengage the cable.""  This is super-annoying and a puzzling oversight. Why even have the hole there? It's like some kind of cruel joke, reminding us of what we could almost have if only we had bought a different case.Finally, and this is just a matter of personal taste, and not design, that whole lanyard thing just seems stupid. The iPod with Video is simply not comfortable to wear around your neck for any period of time, plus it bounces around everytime you walk. It is really annoying. I ended up cutting mine off and throwing it away. No one is going to use it that way, and I'm betting that even a modicum of market research would have revealed that. But that's just me. However, I stand by the first two criticisms I made - those are substantial design flaws that make an otherwise excellent product into a merely mediocre one. Yes, you can use better headphones if you take a Dremel to the case, and yes, you can charge the iPod if you take it out of the case, but the whole point is, you shouldn't have to do either of those things, and a case that requires you to do so is substandard.I doubt I'm going to replace this case with anything else. I have it now, and while I'm not overwhelmed by it, I can go so far as to say that I am whelmed by it. It does what it's supposed to, and I can cope with it's deficits, but I would not buy it again nor can I recommend it all that strongly. Two starts",1

Unfortunately, another 2 months after the warranty expires (from the re-cerified one), the disk went dead again.I would not recommend this model to anyone, since within 1 year, 2 went bad. Also, I don't like the way they handle the replacement within warranty period.",1

It feels cheaply made, and doesn't hold the batteries very securely.  Also, you have to charge two batteries at a time (or sets of 2), and they are inserted in opposite directions.  So, if you're charging 4 batteries in 2 sets of two, they would be + - + -.  I realize that's how most devices are set up when you insert the batteries, but I shouldn't have to worry about that when inserting into a charger, especially since (according most warning labels on batteries) inserting it in the charger backwards may cause an explosion resulting in injury or death.  That's a lot of pressure for someone who just wants more juice for his Gameboy.Ultimately, it does what it says though.  So, if you're looking for a charger to use until you find a real charger, go for it.",1

I called Epson on two different numbers to try to get the facts about the ink quantity in cartridges and no one seems to know the answer.  They gave me a third telephone number which is not an 800 number and it doesn't work.  The qualtiy of printing on DVDs is very good but the printer does not function well and has to be restarted at the beginning of each print job.  This is a very time consuming process.  I could live with this but the ink cost is too high (about $120.00) for a printer that is available for about $60.00,1

After a lengthy set up process I thought I had the thing running, BUT 1) to switch from linksys to computer speakers (or my hardwired system) you always have to exit out of Media Player and restart it (despite the lynksys software telling you you're disconnected), 2)to get back to the Linksys I find you always have to restart Lynksys as well as Media Player, and then it only works a quarter of the time, 3)Rebooting the computer works sometimes to get it hooked up and other times after multiple reboots of everything I just give up and listen to the note book speakers.  This might seem OK if I could just leave it connected but it's wouldn't be because 5) the thing starts acting up and dropping out the music whenever I leave it running for more than an hour or so, I have no idea why.In short a great idea, but until it works it's useless, I suspect most problems are software related.

I could not get this POS to work with my SapphireTech x1600 Pro HDMI card.  I did a clean install of MCE 2005, downloaded all the latest drivers and even bought the 'required' amplified antenna.HDTV - signal through MCE showed 4-5 bars yet ""TV signal could not be found"" error message, tried with Catalyst MC and got nothing but macroblocking.  ATI's support suggested that I had 1. overscan issue, 2. BIOS issues and 3. finally suggested that I try a 3rd party software vendor.  Well, I'll try a 3rd party hardware vendor until ATI figures out their issues.I build PCs as a hobby and have never had such headaches as I did with the 650.  ATI pulled these cards for a reason and re-released them with the requirement of an amplified antenna (look to spend an extra $75).  Support slow and inept.Look elsewhere unless you feel like spending the extra money for an amplified antenna and paying for someone to come out and sort through ATIs driver issues",1

These, however, are the two formats that are supported the least, and a slow, jerky, framerate should be expected.  I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue, and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable, the framerate improved, but not enough, in my opinion, for this device to even claim support for these file types.  If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you, be warned, you should look elsewhere",1

Olevia say they will ship out a power unit to me and then I have to call back to schedule a tech to install it.  It's been 3 weeks and I still don't have the part.  And get this, I live within 10 miles of Olevia's warehouse! Olevia support's hold time is at least 20 minuts each time you call.  I say buying a olevia is more of a roll of the dice.

1088,Crappy Tuner. I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future model,1

Either the mouse positioner worked or the slide advance wheel, I never got the mouse buttons to work.

An iPod control box from Pioneer and a bluetooth handsfree solution from Sony Ericsson would have cost me about half not including installation. Things were looking good until I plugged in the iPod. It sounds like an old turntable with a dusty record. I thought there had to be something wrong so I contacted Tomtom. They said it had to be my windshield mount. They sent me a new one. No help there. Then they wanted it sent in for service. I did. It took 5 weeks. No help there either. I am thinking it is a software fault in the operating system, or the CPU in the unit is just not up to the job. Now for the second big let down. It doesn't charge the iPod!!!!!

The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb, and this case won't close around the 60gb iPod.  A secondary complaint is that, though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks, there is no protection for the screen.  It's just a hole in the case (like the hole for using the wheel), and I just require more protection for my video iPod.  A third (minor) complaint is that there's a non-removable knob on the back of the case, for attaching the belt clip, and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket.  I'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen, too",1

I called the help line, lots of times and usually got someone who didn't speak English very well. They would end up telling me it was a problem with the router.  Then I would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the D-Link.  No one wants to take responsibility for getting it working.  I even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong.  Tried them all in six days and I still don't have it working and has cost me alot of time and ""money"".  Good Luck if you buy it you will need it",1
1097,"Someone from Case Logic PLEASE read my review along with the 2 before me. I will admit that hands down case logic is THE BEST cd wallets you can buy.  They are (usually) constructed with great quality and you actually feel that you get your money's worth.  Even the protection it provides for the cd's that you put it in it is outstanding.  I'm a scratch freak and I've noticed that Case Logic wallets do not put any scratches what-so-ever on your cd's or dvd's.  Not even those little really light ones that you only see in bright light.  Nothing bad to say about them at all, it was pretty much everything a CD wallet should be, at it's finest.  BUT!, new this year is the redesigned version of these wallets and they are TERRIBLE!  The previous models were superior to any other cd wallet out there.  Now they have BROWN STITCHING put against black koskin leather.  The handle looks completely cheap and it comes from inside the wallet.  Letting you know that there is no telling what is holding it in place.  The mesh screen IN the handle is gone, so no more labels can be placed in it.  They are seriously terrible and that's all you can find when you go out shopping for one.  I found this out and quickly rushed to my favorite local electronic store and bought the last (previous model 320 koskin) cd wallet that I was lucky to find in the very back of the shelf.  The rest were the new UGLY and cheaply made ones at the SAME PRICE.  I bought that wallet just in case I needed it within the year and good thing I did, because I needed it, and now need another.  I'm now out of space and in desperate need for a new cd wallet, but I refuse to buy one of these new ones.  It doesn't matter if you get the koskin leather (which is my favorite) or the fabric ones, they are both repulsive in this years model.  So now I sit with old spool casings that used to hold all my blank cd's now holding my real cd's and dvd's until case logic comes back into focus and sells a better quality and improved (this time for real) cd wallet.  This is pretty much everything that the previous 2 reviews say.  I just COMPLETELY agree with everything they say and I'm hoping that somebody from case logic or word gets out to the people and they notice a huge slump in their sales this year.  Please Case Logic, no more brown stitching, poor quality handles and less features in your next model design of these wallets... my fingers are crossed",1

As for some commenting on the smell; yup, it smells.  It smells a bit like chemicals (I assume that is because the outside of the case seems to be made with nylon or something).As for 96 CDs/DVDs; I don't think it's impossible to get 96 in there, but I wouldn't recommend you put 96 of your most preciouse CDs/DVDs in there as it gets really cramped.  Right now I am using mine for copies of old software, old mp3 backups, etc.  Basically stuff that I wouldn't be worried if it got hurt.  The pages are too short from the edge to the inner part of the binder, and that is what makes it hard to fit 96 in there.  The case get's really cramped and you aren't able to flip through the pages very easily.I give it a 2 based on the fact that it is usable, and I got mine from Amazon for a really great price.

So, unless you are using it with a ""selected Sony or Aiwa""  device, DON'T BUY THIS.  It won't work.BTW, I am a slow learner.

I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC.  It frees up a port.  Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch.  It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.I rate this product 5 stars.  When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.

1130,"Pray it doesn't break. I bought a MV2010 in October and installed a second hard drive to back up the first.  The first annoying issue was that transferring the files from an external hard drive using the USB port on the media vault was very slow....  After about 6 weeks of use, the primary hard drive went down.  I used the online support and was told to send the entire unit back for service.  After about a month of not hearing anything, I contacted the service center by phone.  Here, it took about two weeks of calls to figure out that the unit should not have been sent back and that the online service representative was not qualified to deal with the media vault in the first place.  The case was then sent to a Quality Case Manager who said that the first couple of service technicians messed the case up (duh?!) and I would be sent a new unit.  I received a new unit about a week later, but it did not contain a hard drive.  So another two calls to the service center and a drive is sent out.  I installed the drive, and surprise, it did not work!  Another call to Johnny my Quality Case Manager and I find out that the unit that was sent was refubished (perhaps a bad sign that refurbished units are available only 3 months after the unit is introduced).  Another couple of calls and I get a new unit-a full two months after sending the original unit in.  Happily this one has been working for the past 2 months--we'll see how long it lasts",1

Hard to believe when random consumer comments in amazon have better info than a manufacturers knowledge base. I wonder if they know who HP is?

This would not be a big problem if you are writing a letter to your Aunt Margie, but if you are entering financial data, it is a very big deal.Varying the distance from the reciever to the board makes no difference.  Ditto with fresh batteries, even Duracells.There are plenty of other good board out there, so do not waste your time on this one.",1
1143,"Warning!  Buyer Beware!. I just shipped my HP 3052 back off to where it came from.  I either have to really like something or really hate something to write a review on it, and I really hate this printer.  I purchased the HP 3052 after reading some reviews on the HP 3055, and deciding that I didn't need the fax capabilities of the 3055 which didn't seem to work well for most people anyhow.  Apparently, it's not just the fax feature that is faulty, but the scanning and copying leaves a lot to be desired as well.  I purchased this to replace my aging, but still working, 10 year old NEC SuperScript 860 laser printer.  I needed something to make decent copies, and to scan in documents.  Well forget it with this!  You WILL REGRET buying this electronic ""Made in China"" garbage if you are planning on using this for anything other than a printer.  This has changed my opinion on HP, as it will yours if you buy it.When I first power on the unit, I tried copying the Vonage advertisement that came with it by running it through the auto document feeder.  The first thing I notices was that the ADF was loud.  This was fine since noise isn't too much of a concern, just as long is it functions well, and there isn't anyone else around to be disturbed by it.  After examining the copy, I realized the Vonage letters were stretched out about 1/8"" about 3/4 down from the top of the letters.  To make things worse, there was a 1 1/2"" oval shape on the Vonage ad, which this printer distorted one entire side of, almost as if someone had tried to trace it with a pen.  I tried several copies through the ADF with the same results over and over.  I thought that maybe the stretched letters were due to a problem with the auto document feeder, so I tried copying the Vonage brochure on the flat bed.  I did not see a problem with the Vonage letters being stretched when copying on the flat bed, but there was still distortion on the oval shape again.  Next, I tried copying other documents with similar bad results.  Copying bar codes revealed that when printing lines close together, the black bleeds between them!  Edges on copied fonts were a rough as well.Next I tried connecting the 3052 to my PC with USB 2.0.  I ended up with an installation failed message on my first attempt at installing the software.  Looking in device manager, I found a problem with installing the driver for ""Generic IEEE 1284.4 printing support.""  I tried uninstalling and installing the drivers several times to no avail.  I then tried a 400MB full download of the latest full driver release from HP, and had the same problem.  Next, I tried a smaller 40MB driver release on HP's site.  This time I kept getting prompted to locate files that the installation could not find.  After performing a search on my hard drive, I located them in c:\temp, where the installer must have extracted them to.  I had to keep navigating the installer to this directory numerous times during this install.  Much to my amazement, this install attempt actually ended up working.Now I wanted to test the scanning functionality.  The included scanning software is very basic.  It does allow you to setup custom profiles for scanning resolution, destination, and paper type.  I first tested scanning with the included Vonage advertisement again.  The results were to say the list, shocking and very disappointing.  First, the color scans were washed out.  Second, the black on white text had extreme orange and blue halos around the edges, almost like looking at a 3d movie, without the 3d glasses.  Third, there were some visual artifices, scanning inaccuracies, and scanned objects appeared wavy.  Fourth, I got the same results as above when using the ADF for copying as I did scanning.  I wish I could include a sample image so you could see the atrociousness for yourselves.  Lastly, scans are slow, and I found that when scanning in 8 1/2 x 11 documents, they would often be scanned in skewed, no matter what paper the originals were on or how I adjusted the auto document feeder guides.  Furthermore, when I scanned documents with print on both sides, the print on the opposite side would bleed through.  From my experience with photo technology, my hunch would be that the cheap imager in this needs an enormous amount of light to scan, so that images on the opposite side of the page bleed through.I really don't want to say anything good about this printer, but I will say that printing looked very good, and it gets 1 star for this.  Printing was crisp and clear, even with small fonts.  B/W photo printing was on the other hand was mediocre, but who uses a B/W laser printer for photos anyhow?My advice would be to look elsewhere for your scanning and copying needs.  This might do for a cheap printer/scanner/copier for your kids, but not for a professional environment.  I might purchase the Dell 1815dn as it has received good reviews, purchase a separate printer and scanner, or hold out until something better comes along.  I hope this review has been helpful, and can save you from the hassle and expense of a return",1

1145,"It would it being great if D-Link implemented RAID better. I recently bought this product and returned almost immediately after I find out that D-LINK implementation of the RAID was very unreliable.This unit would it being great if you can start with 1 drive and set is as RAID enable so in the future you can buy another drive switch to Raid 1 and the device automatically knows to reformat ONLY the new drive and start mirroring with drive 1. Instead the device only let you run single drive configuration while you had only one drive and if you want to add another drive in the future as Raid 1 it will reformat the old drive so you will lost all your data unless you backup first. Most people buy this device as storage because they don't have more space on their desktop PC so it make no sense to force the user to backup what they had stored on Drive 1 because they won't have were to put it.If you don't care about RAID configuration then the device may work for you, because you will be running 1 or 2 drives independently on single drive configuration. However be aware that every time you upgrade your firmware the device warns you that you should backup your data because it will reformat the drives, what in the world D-Link was thinking?The device format your drives using Linux Ext2 file system so you are not comfortable with this avoid this device. There are free drivers on the internet to allow Windows to mount Ext2 drives so if something happened with the Device you can recover your data from windows, but so far these drivers don't work under Windows Vista and are not recommended computer users that are not familiar with File systems or Partitions.",1

1150,"Stay Away from this Device. I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh!This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.",1

Ordering and shipping was great through Amazon.When I received it, I tested it with my mp3 recorder. My test subject was the television about 8 feet from me, playing at a normal listening level.  My first test, I got very little sound; so I adjusted the input level of the recorder to it's highest level.  The resulting level was enough to hear.  Since I was planning to be able to record lectures at 3-5 times the distance of my test, I knew that this mic alone would not handle the task.  Yesterday I tried it out recording the children's Christmas pagent at church.  The difference in sound over my camcorder's builtin mics was amazing, though there was a low level hiss.  However, there were two things that made me decide to return it.  The first was that there seems to be little or no accoustic isolation of the mic elements and the microphone body; it picked up the slightest touch of the camcorder and even normal touch on the tripod.  It even picked up the motor noise that the internal mic does not.  The second is that it is highly susceptible to electrical interference.  With the mic off, I got a radio station, and when I touched the mic, I heard a buzz.  I removed the mic from the supplied cable, and even the noise I got touching the connector end, wasn't nearly as loud.  I really expected more from Audio Technica, even for a mic at this price",1

I'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day! lolSo hopefully this will last a little longer. But at least I can use it again for now ...I am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error. The viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers",1

HP's support was very bad (although they did send me a new duplexer eventually which still did not solve my problem). After awhile I gave up on trying to get it fixed. All and all I wish I had purchased something else because duplexing is the only reason I got this printer. For someone who does not care that much about the duplexing option, I am sure it would be fine though.",1

1177,"Disappointing. I read something close to a rave review in Walt Mossberg's technology column in the Wall Street Journal, checked the reviews on Amazon. and concluded that it was a good bet to provide extended coverage for my house.  It might have been a good bet beforehand, but one can lose a 'good bet' and I did.Setup was virtually instantaneous and the two XE104s started talking to each other and the roving laptop I was using to test achieved a good internet connection (about 40 MBPS) through its direct ethernet cable connection to the ""its"" XE104.  That was while we were in the same room; then things went downhill quickly.  Many of the other outlets in my house barely got a connection with the Netgear utility showing as low as 1.05 MBPS!  Like another reviewer, I think Netgear overestimates true throughput;  I think actual throughput was much lower than reported given the time to transfer a file from my laptop to my desktop.After testing a number of outlets, I concluded that this product is not the answer for me.  The reviews have been very good ... why did I get such a bad result?  I concluded it had a lot to do with my house wiring.  Outlets that were close to each other and on the same breaker box seemed to perform acceptably (but not better than wireless G).  Outlets that were further away and/or were on the second breaker box in my house did far worse.My advice to anyone buying this is to make sure you can return it without penalty if it doesn't work out.  If your wiring is old and especially if you have more than one breaker box, be wary of the possibility that it won't work for you.I suspect the Netgear XE104 will work satisfactorily for far more customers than it it will disappoint, but regrettably I'm in the latter group.",1

My songs on the MP3 repeat sometimes and the headphone jack is faulty causing the sound to cut out and sound bad unless you hold the cord into the unit.

1192,"Don't bother with the alarm clock. If you want a wood cabinet radio, buy the Model 1. If you want a great alarm clock, read on.. I purchased a model 3 about two years ago.  I loved the wood finish and like the old-time look of the controls, and the sound quality of the radio is very good.That said I have been remarkably unhappy with the product overall (this is my first ever review on Amazon because I felt so strongly about this product.)The initial, and less significant complaint, is that the low-contrast (grey on brown) printed numbers on the control panel are basically illegible in all but very bright and direct light (not what you typically have on your nightstand). I'm a guy in his early 30's with good vision, so this is not your grandpa complaining about this detail...Next, the light in the clock was so bright that we kept a hanky on the nightstand to cover it at night.However, the real, and totally unexpected Failure of this product is the alarm clock itself:1. The alarm itself must be set by rotating a bezel ring that is pretty stiff and requires a good deal of force to turn (my girlfriend hates it).2. The alarm is on a 12-hour cycle, so it will go off twice a day if you don't remember to disable it by one of a couple of different button-pressings & knob twists required to disable/enable the alarm.3. And the clincher:  The snooze doesn't work like any other alarm I've ever used:  If the alarm goes off (whether waking to music, or to an alarm tone) and you press the snooze button after more than 2-3 minutes of music, the snooze WILL NOT WORK (!) and you will actually be shutting off the alarm altogether.Often, if I have a very early flight for example, I will wake to music, which will take a few minutes to really wake me up, at which point I may want to snooze once (for 10 minutes) before getting up & going.  To my knowledge, this is pretty common alarm clock usage.I discovered this flaw when I missed an early morning flight from SF to NYC, because I did just that: I pressed the snooze button, once, after what could not have been more than 2 minutes of music.  -What I had really done was shut the alarm down altogether...Needless to say, after scrambling to get a later flight, and rearrange meetings in NYC, I called Tivoli to tell them my radio was flawed (I'd bought direct).  The girl in customer service told me the radio was behaving normally: that the snooze would actually serve only as an ""alarm shut off"" button if I waited more than ""about 3 minutes"" (her words) into the alarm to press it.She also told me that this was normal, and it's ""the way all alarm clocks work.""I've owned at least a half dozen alarm clocks in my life, and have stayed in at least a hundred hotel rooms.  Never have I seen a snooze button that really just shuts the alarm down and let's you oversleep.Tivoli touts themselves as a high-end, high-attention-to-detail manufacturer. They acknowledge that this bizarre snooze system is in fact ""the way it works"" and go on to claim that this is normal for alarm clocks in general.I can scarcely express how unimpressed I am with this company & this product.I've now moved the TIVOLI MODEL 3 to the kitchen and purchased a BOSTON ACOUSTICS RECEPTER for the nightstand.  The Recepter's alarm & tuning controls are truly excellent (especially the preset functions) and, aside from the audio being slightly bass-heavy, WE LOVE the Receptor!!!Oh, and the snooze works great!!  :",1

1194,"Street Atlas 2005 HH provides wrong route and hard to use. I bought the blue logger and both Street atlas 2005 and SA2005 HH for my Dell X50V. No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows:1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum.

1209,"Love affair gone sour. I have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor.I shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose.For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)But after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various ""drives"" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement.Most of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad.It is of course possible that there's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won't be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I've been through, just in case",1

We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position.

1212,"Do NOT buy this router!. First of all, I am a dyed-in-the-wool techie.  I design products like this in my job.  I know what every single one of those ""what the heck is that?"" settings in router set up screens are.  So I do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many (most) who have had trouble with this router ""MORONS"".Yes, I got it to work.  It will work right out of the box IF used with most pre-N wireless cards and, definitely, if they are Linksys pre-N cards.  That covers about 1% of those who would buy this router.  After three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default, I succeeded in getting it to ""hand-shake"" with b and g mode cards most of the time.  It would still randomly lose the IP requiring rebooting everything.  Not something my customer would accept nor would I sell.Some of the techie specs are a long way from what Linksys claims. Linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both.  They failed.  A non-techie spec important to everyone is range.  It has 20% the range of an old b mode Linksys router I had sitting right next to it.  Adding encryption dropped range in half again!  The wired router portion of it works out of the box, no adjustments required.  But you're buying this for the wireless function.Yes, I could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with.  But Linksys didn't used to be that way.  I used to buy only Linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware.  This is the third Linksys router in a month (the other two were g mode) that have been unstable or DOA.   Then why did I buy this one?  It was on sale and I wanted to give Linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good.  They've now lost it for good.  I exchanged the router for a Netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards.  Plus it was a lot less money.Has Cisco ruined Linksys?  Got me.  Did all the good engineers cash out?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for Wall Street?  You bet!  I'll stick with Netgear and Belkin from now on.",1

I returned it to the repair site at my expense and received a replacement--red sauce on the speakers and the CD would not even power up.  Obviously, no one had even looked at it.  I received a second replacement unit--CD would not even spin and I received ""error message"".  Called again and they are shipping my third unit.  This is very frustrating as the repair service has very poor quality control and the unit has significant problems as I am not the only one with these problems",1

I have been very careful with how I store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from USB ports.

1224,"painful set-up, poor range. Having had very good luck with two Belkin G routers, I thought that the G+ would be a no-brainer. NOT. First of all, the router would not install at all from Windows 2000. I called customer support, and after interminable waits and two tech support people (who were very polite), we finally decided to install from another computer with Windows XP. All seemed to be going along fine--the router installed--but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their G-router setups did. Only when I logged on wirelessly, it let me set a password----meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me, it would have been THEM setting MY password (which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless!). It also came without a user's guide (though that is listed on the box contents) and the CD-ROM also was supposed to have a user's manual, but when I clicked on the ""user manual"" tab, nothing came up! After all was said and done, I did manage to get my XP system connected, but the Windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable (it was working fine on a Linksys direct cable before). Overall--a very painfully long installation that was not Windows 2000-compatible (or perhaps a firewall problem), items left out of the package, and a big step down in ease of installation from their G router. And if that isn't bad enough--the signal strength was no improvement over the Linksys G router I was replacing. Belkin, sorry--this product was below your previous standard. This one's going back to Best Buy",1

1227,"Reminds me of a quarter horse race. Great performance but only for a short time.  Don't get me wrong, I loved this dvd player (when it worked).  It had great features, crisp picture, and good control over the search and pause features.  Yeah, there were some downsides to it that have already been mentioned through other reviews.  For example, when listening to music or other media, it only shows things like ""directory"", ""root file"", and folder numbers.  Makes it hard to browse...but I found this to be of little inconvenience.  The main problem was that it broke within a year.  Now I'm not unrealistic.  I know that electronics wear out, but I also know that most last much longer that this.  I'm not expecting it to last as long as my VCR, a JCPenny's brand we got during the 80's...but one year?  What a rip-off.  Just as others posters mentioned, I got the infamous ""H02 Error"" message and then nothing.  Didn't even bother calling the company since the warranty was only 90 days.  I already knew what I was going to be told.  My advice...keep looking.  With this many similar reviews, there must be a design flaw with this model somewhere and it's not gonna get fixed by a company whose only concern is the bottom line.

It randomly loses connectivity to both my Intellimouse, and my MS USB keyboard. 30 - 90 secondes go by and then it reconnects, sometimes to redisconnect within seconds, sometimes it'll stay connected for half an hour at a time. Weirdly, it seems to maintain connectivity to the Monitor - though often as a generic display rather than as a flat panel Samsung.

Now it's loose all the time.  So I'm replacing it with a Belkin AV20500-15 cable, available right here at Amazon for about 1/4 the price of Monster.

1231,"""PLEASE WAIT"" (flash....flash....flash.....). Great features, unreliable POOR design. OK, lets not mince words....it sucks!Hey, I'm a big fan of Panasonic, but this unit appears to suffer from many problems. Right out of the box, the DVD player hangs and only a complete restart will solve the problem, also the remote has a bad habit of completely freezing which requires you to cycle power to the unit. Not good. But my biggest complaint is the alleged ""One Touch"" recording...this feature does NOT work at all, and the alternate method requires a PhD. in Rocket Science so this unit is going back to the store. Not to mention how slow this thing is. I've never seen any home electronics device that prompted you to ""WAIT"", well I cant wait to get my money back.To Panasonic's credit, this player/recorder has all the right features and outputs like HDMI and Optical audio, and the upconversion to a digital display is quite good, even from old VHS tapes that appear to be near DVD quality. However, this machine is very buggy and the manual (as I have read) is absolutely worthless. If you can follow it, then you don't have to take the Mensa entrance exam, you're already in",1
1232,"I Am Thoroughly Disappointed over the Confusion of Operation. I have been a loyal Sony product user for over 30 years.  However, their Compact Disc Recorder RCD-W500C/W100 is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that I have ever seen.  It reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech- incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone's tastes.  For instance, why does it need a remote?  How many people will be cutting CDs from their easy chairs?  I have a call in to two friends who I hope can rescue me from my dilemma",1

I cannot confirm the date because I was inbetween gamming rigs at the time, but I tried to use this joystick after getting my new rig fired up and was set back when I encountered the calibration issues.  There is no fix for this and if you hadn't put in the warranty card, then your out your investment.  Go with wired untill the manufacturer takes some responsibility",1
1235,"Returned It - Screen Went Blank. I really wish this product had been better designed because I loved the fact that it's a tablet style and it's a lot easier to hold and watch, especially when you are sitting in tight spots like a bus or plane, and space is at a premium.Alas, my unit had several problems and I decided to return it.  The biggest problem was that after about 3 days of use, the screen went blank on me when I turned it on.  I had to fiddle with the battery pack and plug it into the A/C adaptor to get the screen picture to come back on.  A few days later, it happened again, and then again.The other big problem was that it really didn't like playing DVDs that I burned myself.  It played regular store DVDs well, but when I played my own burned DVDs, whether it was DVD+R or DVD-R, the player's picture would constantly freeze.  It just couldn't handle the slightest imperfections on the disc, and since home-burned DVDs aren't burned in the same fashion as commercial DVDs, this player was just too sensitive to successfully playback home burned DVDs.The final concern was the fact that it didn't come with any kind of case, and there is no way to protect the screen while transporting it.  I was very concerned that over time, the screen would get scratched and damaged.  You would seriously need to consider buying a 3rd party case for this unit.Design-wise, the tablet style is a great idea and I hope that more manufacturers start making tablet style units in the future",1

The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film.  Why then do I give it one star?It skips.  Like nobody's business.  At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched.  But then we put in new disks.  No difference.  When exactly does it skip?  Impossible to tell.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes every frame!  Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad.  Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.Save your money!  Buy from someone else",1
1238,"The REAL Truth!. Alot of the reviews I read here are misleading. Most of these complaints are related to not knowing how to use the GPS correctly. However certain problems do exist with the RoadMate 3000T / 3050T units. Here are some pros and cons I have observed.First, the Pros...1) Better than reading a map (LOL).2) Easy to Read Screen and Large enough to handle big fingers with few mistakes.3) Built-in MP3 player.Now, the Cons...1) Unit often freezes up. More so after having updated the Firmware!2) You can have EITHER music OR directions (not both at same time).3) Photo Viewer is TERRIBLE! (Don't care much about that feature though).4) Cannot use an FM transmitter to play music/directions over the radio due to severe interferrence.5) Maps are NOT as accurate as they would have you believe!6) NOT GOOD for commercial drivers, as excluding certain roads is a PAIN!Apples for apples, I think the TomTom would be a much better buy. I have been quite disappointed with the Magellan RoadMate 3000T. The price has dropped significantly since I purchased mine, so if you want to resell the unit later, you will lose alot in the investment.You ONLY get the car charger for it, so you might want to buy the AC adapter (especially if you want to transfer music onto the SD card). The GPS unit uses a different format on the SD card (memory card). Once you put it into your GPS, it can't be used with your computer, digital camera, etc. You have to use the Magellan software included with the unit to transfer MP3 files onto the SD card.You will most likely also need the external antenna for it to avoid freeze ups. Finally, the map software is out of date and Magellan has yet to update their maps.Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere",1

The bass is fuzzy even at medium volume levels, forget about high volume, it sounds awful. The remote is oversized and shaped oddly, it's curved and doesn't sit flat. I am going try and return it.

But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs.Don't buy this product.

Clock worked great, radio was so-so, but not a big deal, and the CD had good quality sound for the price.  Though I found setting the clock and preset stations a bit complicated for my tastes, overall, I was still pleased.  The next week, the radio quit working--still no big deal--since I bought it more for the CD and alarm clock.  The week after that, the alarm quit working.  Then this week, the CD quit as well.  I can't even get it to power ""ON.""  Of course, by this time, I had long ago discarded the box, so returning it was out of the question.

At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched.  But then we put in new disks.  No difference.  When exactly does it skip?  Impossible to tell.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes every frame!  Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad.  Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.Save your money!

My GPS only has a USB cable, while the software will only read from a COM port. Once I got the data into the computer, I had to translate it so the software would recognize the format (these were supposed to work together!). The detail for tracking through the woods was totally unacceptable. Also, I have to always have disk 3 installed before I can even run the program.

It was almost impossible to make one line with one single stroke of the pen.To accomplish one grainy line, you would have to use the tablet very, very slowly.In no time at all, the mouse was broken and the pen was doing wierd tricks with my photoshop.

I used them before bed one night and the next afternoon I went to use them and there was nothing but a loud buzzing coming out of the left speaker. I fiddled with all the cables and connections. Nothing but buzz. I turned everything off & on, still nothing but buzz. The right speaker seemed to work just fine. In frustration, I turned off everything til the next day. Fired it all back up and the buzz was still there. Thankfully, I had kept the receipt and packing material and returned it within the 30 day time limit. I had the opportunity to upgrade them for the newer Bose Companion set and I chose to go with a Logitech system with small speakers and a subwoofer I can hide under my desk.

It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject!  Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose.  That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it.  Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)!  They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work.   There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else!  Any recommendations?  Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them.

Regardless of how your CD is encoded, it will pause two seconds between EVERY TRACK . . . which can be irritating when you're playing a CD of allegedly-continuous music, like an opera or the White Album or Dark Side of the Moon.  I called Toshiba to ask about this, and they were confirmed this.  They said ALL Toshiba DVD players pause between music tracks, and that basically I was stuck.So, I'm warning you, and frankly I think they should print a warning on every box.

1296,"BEFVP41 and Microsoft PPtP Servers. As you may have read elsewhere, this router has a problem with the GRE protocol used by Microsoft for their PPtP server (see Alan Bryant's May 27, 2004 review).This will stop you using it with the built-in PPtP VPN client/server which is provided with Windows 2000/XP.Here is the text of a complaint I have submitted to Linksys...""I am attempting to operate a Microsoft PPtP server behind a BEFVP41 (firmware 1.41.1). I have PPtP Pass Through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed IP address of the server but the router refuses to pass the GRE protocol used by Microsoft (Protocol 47).In answer ID 737, you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with GRE. It does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem. GRE does not use TCP/UDP port 47, it is 'Protocol 47', something entirely different.It seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem.I and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the BEFVP41 (1.41.1) is incapable of handling the GRE protocol correctly.Can you please advise when a fix will be implemented? This is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product.I also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in IP protocols than myself.""I await a reply from Linksys as I write this review.Having said all that, if you have no interest in running the Microsoft PPtP server, the BEFVP41 may do everything else you require.It functions okay as a basic NAT router and it's stealth capabilities are good (Steve Gibson's 'Shields Up' reports 'True Stealth' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host).The in-built IPSec tunneling works well. I am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of BEFSX41's very reliably.The web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually.To summarise:A reasonable basic NAT router.Very good stealth.IPSec tunneling works okay (at least to other Linksys products).Microsoft's PPtP server will NOT work with the current firmware version.",1

It sounded like I was only getting about half the sound out at 600 Hz.  It seemed to keep up just decently above 2000 Hz, though I didn't test too much at the high end.The advertised range for these speakers is clearly very far off.I don't think that this problem could be fixed with a sub woofer.

Beware of KINGSTON rebates!Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying ""your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer.""Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams",1

I contacted the customer service department and they said they won't deal with me unless I have the original package (which I don't anymore). They adviced me to contact the PNY store. So I did a little research and found that the exact same card is from Toshiba (Model:SD-MO2G) and J&R or whoever their suppliers are just put a PNY label on it to sell it as a PNY. If you don't believe me, just type Toshiba SD-MO2G on Google and the picture is exactly the same except for the little lable. I really don't care if the card is made by Toshiba or PNY as long as it is 2GB, but it isn't. And that would make it really tough to recover your loss from any party (PNY, Toshiba, or J&R).

1318,"RUN, Run  Forrest; Run fast, take it from ME!. .............Is not functional................ .If you are reading this then you are Gump-y! And, you and I must be family.First, I love Amazon; they are the consistent type of e-merchant.  And that's good! But but but but, why?:  would a designated (by me) upper ""echelon"" merchant like Amazon carry this Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). It simply is not functional information that I stored Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is gone, or not readable. I am surprised that Amazon did not catch-on/up with the problem.The product won't retain any info then I had to store less and less information on the card, so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours. I decided to contact Amazon, they were very shortly, and cordially sent me a replacement Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), with the paperwork for returning the original Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768).Then I got something that:A.	Did, have the shape of a 2gig Sandisk CF card;B.	Did, have the Sandisk label that says Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768)......;C.	And did have the original shiny factory Sandisk package. None-being the-less 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed couldn't recognize what is inserted into the CF reader.D.	The brand new replacement card I got with the original factory wrapping, that's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers. One may safely assume (pardon the facetiousness), Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), is yet to be recognized.From Amazon, twice in the mail, I got a Sandisk 2 GB compact which flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). Both cards I received had a problem. And therefore, it is safe to assume that Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) production have a major glitch. I mean, the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes. I have to yet see what or for what, other than memory, can I utilize a memory card. I beg your pardon, but in essence I am trying to imply that... The Sandisk products were a joke! :-).Being the consistent e-merchant that Amazon always been, Amazon agreed to return them. This was not a surprise (coming from Amazon).In essence, I strongly urge any person that makes a living, and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to:1.	Not be fooled. If you see Sandisk, run away as fast as possible,2.	You'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so.3.	Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is not compatible with data storage! or even short transfers of data, from a home computer to work.4.	Spend the extra.... on an alternative brand.5.	That's the only way you'll get a CF card that is correctly labeled; and, serve intended functions.6.	I strongly recommend, as well as urge individual who is thinking of  getting that ""other"" brand of 2-giga...... cards to make sure do so:................7.	Use Amazon only, and don't be fooled by any other e-merchant who's not as high of an echelon as Amazon....... Amazon!8.	Had it not been for Amazon, I would have lost all I paid. :).God bless Amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness, I also pray for Sandisk, so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line.God bless, and keep on shopping.",1

The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages",1
1325,"Uncomfortable, Light on Bass. OK, the only headphones that I can compare this to is the sennheiser hd500 which I paid $100 for in 2002. My dog chewed the line and I had to buy another set, so I decided to go with the Zalman Surround Sound based on reviews I read starting when Doom 3 was released in 2004.Sad to say, these headphones don't have ANYTHING on the Sennheiser HD500. The Zalman headphones are very uncomfortable becuase they sequeeze my ears too tightly. My ears star hurting after 15 minutes whereas with the sennheiser hd500, I could wear the 24/7 and gain only comfort. I'm used to heavy, intense bass from the Sennheiser headphones where I can crank up the volume and be blown away. With the Zalman headhones, I find myself lowering the volume because everything is so high-pitched.The surround sound aspect are almost completely identical between the two, imo.Also, the left ear muff was detached when I opened the box & putting it back on has been unsuccessful. I'm supposed to be able to just twist it on, but even though nothing is broken, it wont fit back in place.I'm disappointed with these headphones & I only bought them because of the reviews here. I guess most people haven't heard what it's like to listen to games and movies through qality headphones.Alas, I guess I can only blame myself for this purchase.My advice for anyone looking for genuine quality: Skip these and go elsewhere",1
1326,"Does not live up to its promise. I had high hopes for this, but three major flaws contributed to it being returned:1) The display is extremely bright. I ended up covering it with a t-shirt, just to be able to get to sleep.2) Even though bright, the display cannot be read unless you are close and at the correct angle.3) The sounds quality was surprisingly bad. I knew this wasn't a fancy, expensive model, but the sound was unbearably distorted, especially at lower volumes (e.g. you want your ipod music on in the background). I though my ipod battery was dead at first, but apparently the speakers on this unit are just that bad.So it fails as a clock, and as an iPod player. I never tried the radio function, but even if that was excellent it would not have saved the product from being returned",1

1330,"Good features, but for one serious flaw ... I bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system.  I based my decision on information as stated on the Pioneer web site, and the attractive price compared to some of the other options I considered.This receiver does have a number of good features, but has one serious flaw.  It will not display on screen status messages for daily operations, like volume and sound mode, unless you have a Pioneer display, and run another special cable from the receiver to the TV (As a side note, Pioneer needs to understand we want to run LESS cables to our display).  That means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-Pioneer TV, which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver, and very infrequently after that.  (The set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs, and audio calibtraion.)Sounds like a small deal, but in many home theaters, including mine, the electronics are not in the line of site (mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything.)  This not uncommon, many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors, and it means I have no idea what the volume is, what sound mode I am using, or anything beyond the set-up menu unless I go into the closet. BAD, BAD, BAD!  This seems to be a marketing ploy by Pioneer to get you to buy Pioneer TV's and projectors, and it is beyond stupid.  If this was not the case I would rate this receiver much higher, but it is a SERIOUS flaw.  It makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult.This limitation also means, if you have mulitple displays, I have a plasma TV and projector in my theater, you need to run thier special cable to both displays, and both have to be Pioneer.  Again, I have to say BAD, BAD, BAD!The other features are as stated on the Pioneer website, but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display, and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems, unless they have a Pioneer display with SR+.  (Oh yeah, your Pioneer display has to be also be equipped with SR+, thier way of linking the two units.  If your Pioneer display is not equipped with SR+, you are again out of luck.  Did I mention this is BAD?!)25 Feb 2007 - addition to reveiw:I called Onecall and they will take unit back, but at 15% restocking fee, plus paying for shipping both ways.  While Onecall really did nothing wrong (Pioneer is lying about the OSD!), it is one of thier vendors and not the customer's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud.  Buyer beware from Onecall, thier customer service on this one was not good",1

1332,"A real disappointment. My #1 use for this scanner is for public safety scanning - I have family in law enforcement & we like to listen in.I own a Uniden BC248CLT, & for years I owned a BC80XLT handheld. My BC80XLT was recently damaged & needed replaced. I ordered this BC72XLT, & am ready to return it also. It is not anywhere near the quality my prior Uniden handheld was. My 80 picked up as well or better than my 248 does here at home. This 72 picks up maybe 50% of the traffic of my others--whether in the house, outside, or even right in town. The buttons on this are awful, too. I have to go through multiple steps to do things that took only 1 button press on the 80. The reception, though, is my biggest concern AND complaint.  I never had to purchase any extra antenna or such for my other Uniden handheld to get the better reception. Also, the volume, even at max output, is only ""normal"" listening level--so if I am in a noisy environment, I cannot turn it up to hear it better. My old BC80XLT had much better volume.An additional warning - Uniden's Support has gone down the toilet. I thought Uniden was a company that would at least *acknowledge* my complaint, and maybe even have some suggestions of a better product - all I got was an auto reply that I should hear from Customer Service in 2-3 business days--and then I never heard a thing. I checked my support question on their site, and it was marked ""closed."" Good luck",1

1334,"Incompetent garbage which cannot be shut down. Pro ---* Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row.For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard.To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row.* The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate.Con ---* The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below).* Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap.The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat ""while on your lap or on a non-flat surface"".This ""lock"" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8"" along the top of the board from the left half into the right.Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated ""V"" shape after any amount of light-handed typing.HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed.* The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to ""enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC"". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle.A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right.* The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys.* It doesn't turn off.Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch.The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch.What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries.The automatic ""sleep mode"" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard.Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes.The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly.Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords ""bluetooth keyboard"". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch.For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries.Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user.Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row.How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me.All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name.It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism.But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name.If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400.My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq.The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality.Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.",1

1336,"BEWARE SAMSUNG DLP DESIGN FLAWS!!!. Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to ""turn it off"", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!I have a 42"" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26"" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP",1

1342,"Avoid It. The quality of sound and manufacture of this unit is unacceptable.  It was made in China.  Although it has an attractive design, the outside is made from the same inexpensive plastic that my $29 Panasonic DVR is made from.  The recorder has two modes, SP and EP.  SP is the highest quality, but playback still sounds cheap at the highest quality.  There also are two microphone settings, Dictation and Conference.  In Dictation mode, the microphone can only pick up what is said within about 12 - 18 inches.  The quality is audible, but not great.  Conference mode only works when one person is speaking in a completely quiet room, something that is not realistic with people shuffling about.  Any background noise will render the recording inaudible.  Even in a quiet room, the quality is muffled and unacceptable.  The high price for this unit definitely is not indicative of its quality, which appears to be low.  I have other, less expensive units, that are better built and have a higher audio quality.  I do not understand the other reviews, other than to believe someone with less experience using DVRs would have a different expectation.  Perhaps it works better with an external microphone or when used solely in a closed environment (such as a quiet, closed interrogation room), which I believe defeats the purpose of a small pocket-sized unit meant to be carried around.A 1 MB XD card gives 168 hours in SP mode or 358 hours in EP, which would be great if the product worked.  Similar to other brands, the controls are not intuitive, but can be learned easily and are not a drawback",1

When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before.  The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home.  After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods.  In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair!  What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable.

I have several issues with this player:1) The case-open slider is along the side of the player is situated where the cords come out and it is difficult to open the player as a result.2) The buttons are too small. They seem designed for infants or people with abnormally small fingers.3) It will sometimes shut itself off for no apparent reason. I will turn it on, then wait for the first track, and instead of playing it, it will sometimes shut down.4) If I hit PLAY twice in a row it makes a continuous high-pitched beeping sound that is at the actual volume level. It is unnecessarily loud and obnoxious.5) The velcro is not very sticky and so far has failed to adhere to the dash. I plan on using 30-minute epoxy to affix the velcro patches.6) The fast forward will only go at what seems like 2x meaning it takes longer than necessary to speed through a track.Overall, this design gets an F. Its quality is well below what I would expect from Sony. It actually plays the discs fine, but it usability is severely limited by poor design choices.Addendum: Now it won't play at all.

1353,"Very Bad Product. I wish I never bought this phone!Like some others mentioned; it was a huge waste. The landline connection works but it is very difficult to hear the other person on the line, sometimes it is very loud, sometimes you can't tell what he/she is saying. The volume controls are difficult to balance. The menus are very badly designed makes you feel like the phone is a kids toy or something. When dialing a number you will be faced with the number being pressed twice or sometimes it wont appear on the screen, this is because of the lousy design of the keypad.I have hooked it up to my pc and at first it worked and the pc recognized it and it was ok, the second time I unhooked it and then retried connecting it and the pc didnt find it, I unloaded the software reloaded but nothing.Believe me if you like using the yahoo voice features stick with a set of headsets and mic, if you want to get tacky maybe get some bluetooth gear, but this phone is not worth a cent.",1
1354,"What Cheap Can Buy. I won't beat around the bush, this is a terrible product.  I was looking for something to allow Mic level recordings on my computer (Macbook Pro) and I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money on an iMic.  I found this remarkably cheaper device, and decided to try it instead.  When I got it, the first thing I thought upon seeing the packaging was how un-professional it looked.  The box looks like something someone printed off their computer, and it even had spelling errors on it.  When I popped the device out of the box it came apart in my hand.  Right then I knew I had made a mistake.  It comes with a minidisc that 1. doesn't fit in a mac, and 2. only had PC software on it.  Of course the box and the product page don't say what platform this device is for, and indeed my Mac did recognize it when plugged in.  However, when I switched over to USB audio out, my ears were nearly blown out.  There was absolutely no way to control the volume.  Upon plugging in a Mic, I found the device didn't even respond  The audio in channel lights up half way as though it's picking up some signal, but it doesn't make a sound (tested with Line In and Garage Band and no response).  This is a shoddy, unprofessional product that should be avoided at all cost.  Don't be cheap, I'm sure the iMic is loads better",1

THis should be back lit, and numbers should be bigger.  4.  All in all, a real dissappointment and it is going back",1
1356,"Worked great at first, till it only started taking left turns... I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally.",1

1362,"Docupen, all looks, no serivce. This letter is a summary of my experience with PlanOn for the past 6 months.It all began innocent enough, I saw an article about the Docupen, and saw immediate possibilities for potential use.  Over the summer of 2006 I was going to order the DocuPen 800 Pro, for I was going to have great use in my teaching environment with Worcester State College as well as Becker College, both located in Worcester, Massachusetts.From a technological perspective, I was intrigued, so began my research of trying to learn more of the product.  I searched the web for reviews, personal opinions, etc... and well all in all, things seemed positive minus the software interface and the fact the system shuts off after EVERY one page scan.Anyway, in early August I decided to order a Docupen, even though on the website it said orders were taking 2-3 weeks to fill.  I called sales, and was told that do to manufacturing delays, it was going to be closure to 4 weeks for fulfillment or I could just call back in September when the Docupens are to be in.I placed my order on September 15, 2006 for a DocuPen Rc800 Pro, standard color $349.00 order number:XXXX.  Now all I had to do was wait.  Two weeks went by and no word from PlanOn in regards to the status from my order.  Now school has been in session for a week now, but that is ok.  When I called, I am told that the shipment didn't arrive do to manufacturing difficulties.  At this point, I am willing to believe customer service.  Two more weeks go by and still not response from customer service about the status of my shipment.  I attempt to call the 1-888-507-3926 and keep getting the answering service.   I tried on-line chat-support, only to find out that an order that was suppose to take 2-3 weeks, is now going to take 6-8 weeks.  The kind lady from customer service offered me a carrying case for the scanner when it arrives.  I really didn't care about any carrying case, I just wanted up front honesty about where the heck my scanner was and when was it going to be delivered.3 months go by and finally, the Docupen scanner arrives, was it worth the wait, NO!  In total, the delivery time took over 3 months.  In such time I was able to find another product that better met my needs for the purpose of scanning documents.  Even though I had decided to purchase another product, I was still looking forward to using my PlanOn DocuPen.  All I have to say is that I was sorely disappointed at the scan quality, the poor software options and overall experience for PlanOn.  So with no hesitation, I requested to return my DocuPen under the 30-day money back guarantee.Was that to be the end of my frustrations with PlanOn, NO!Here is a time line of various correspondences in the attempts to get an RMA and refund issued.December 4, 2006 - initial request for an RMADecember 4, 2006 - I receive standard RMA procedureDecember 4, 2006 - All required questions from RMA questionnaire have been answered and emailed backDecember 11, 2006 - receive RMA sheetDecember 12, 2006 - send back Docupen according to PlanOn specifications with tracking # and signature confirmation, emailed RMA department to inform of statusDecember 14, 2006 - receive email from RMA rep saying that they will be looking out for the packageDecember 18, 2006 - receive email verification (from Post Office) of signature confirmationJanuary 8, 2007 - I email RMA rep to find out statusJanuary 14, 2007 - I email RMA rep again to find out statusJanuary 18, 2007 - I receive an email from the RMA rep informing me that the package had indeed arrived, and that the credit would be issued in 5 daysJanuary 25, 2007 - I still have not received any verification or communication that my credit is being processedJanuary 29, 2007 - I call PlanOn and have the following conversations ""called PlanOn today (1/29/07) I spoke with a Harmony from customer service.  I was told that April McKnight is the credit manager.  Apparently the credit manager has been out of the office for the past week.  Though that doesn't explain the email from Nick on 1/18/07 explain that the credit will be issued in 5 days.  Here over two weeks after that email, apparently the credit is still sitting on April's desk.  I was told by Harmony that it will be taken care of this week.""So I have been more than patient in regards to waiting for reply and follow up from anyone from PlanOn.  Every time I contacted someone about the request for an RMA, I was the one that had to follow up (4 times) before receiving a reply to my request.  I have now emailed three times in regards to receipt of my returned docupen.Needless to say, I find the product not worth the time or the money.  The company has  miserable customer service.  But I should have been aware of this when I first placed my order and was told it would take 2 weeks and it arrived 3 months later, and the product was a piece of junk",1

I didn't find any other phone w/ these features even though, to me, they seem like minimal features in a modern phone.  Anyway, I am really disappointed.  Each feature is poorly executed such that it is really a pretty lousy phone.  The shared phonebook is a nice idea but so hard to access and find the number that its really quicker to dial the number yourself.  The voicequality of the handsets is inferior to every other phone I've used.  The only (sorta) exception is that the handset speakerphone voicequality is even worse.   5.8 DSS is nice, but the range is short (doesn't reach out to my driveway even though my baby monitor works fine in that location).  I recommend that you not buy this phone.  Wait till another company implements this feature set in a better phone",1
1371,"Don't be fooled, this one is junk. The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny ""button within a button"" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is",1

Overall, the user interface is great, and very easy to understand and configure.  The setup was easy, and I also thought that the windshield suction-cup mount worked well, which I know a lot of other people complained about.  The items that led me to return the unit are as follows:1) Bluetooth hands free- the clarity on this wasn't bad on my end, but the anyone I talked to on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me well.  I had the external mic on my visor, so it was probably no more than 2 feet from my mouth.  Unless I was holding it in front of my mouth, the connection wasn't clear.  I also had problems where my Motorola RAZR V3 would simply disconnect from the TomTom for no reason, or send a call straight to voicemail rather than letting it ring through the TomTom.2) The Point of Interest database is lacking.  I had read this in other articles, but didn't believe it could be that bad.  I was wrong! Basically, when it comes to restaurants, it only contains fast food, and aside from that, anything retail related is lacking.If you are just looking for navigation where you aren't relying on POIs and don't need hands free calling, this unit would work fine...but then again, without those features you could get something much cheaper that would get the job done!

1382,"Very Poor Quality Device. I normally don't like to write bad reviews; however, I'm compelled to do so for the Linksys WCG200 version 2 due to the chronic instability of the device.I'm truly sorry I bought this device and I'm frustrated at Linksys since they do not appear to be offering any firmware updates to fix the issues.Both my wife and I work from home, so device outages are readily apparent.  We have a Comcast broadband connection that has proved reliable since we got it in 2001.  Until we bought the WCG200 , we were using separate devices for the cable modem, router, and wireless functions and decided to upgrade to the WCG200 since it has all three functions integrated.Below is a list what I have observed in the last 4 months of using the WCG200.  I've found several Internet posts that detail similar issues for other folks.  There seems to be a correlation of these issues with Comcast users; however, that may not be conclusive since Comcast has such large market share.1. Frequent crashing of the device when wireless users are connected.  The device will often stop responding and require a reboot.  When we're using its wireless capabilities this occurs several times per day.  If we don't use the wireless, the crashes still occur; however, they are markedly less frequent.  I've also noticed that changing the wireless security settings seems to change the frequency of crashes.  The device would crash hourly when using WPA or WPA2 security.2. The administration pages stop responding after the device has been running for some time (usually about a day or two).  In this case, the unit will still process traffic; however, I must reboot it to get into the administration interface.3. The administration pages (when working) sometimes stall for 30-60 seconds.4. The modem log doesn't always work properly.  I've cleared the log and had old entries come back after a reboot.To be fair, Linksys does make other devices that work better.  I've been a Linksys customer for several years...while I've seen quality issues before they usually come out with a firmware upgrade to address them.",1

Sometimes it will move to the upper-left.  This is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable.

1418,"BEWARE SAMSUNG DLP DESIGN FLAWS!!!. Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to ""turn it off"", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!I have a 42"" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26"" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP",1

The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.",1

1458,"Routing bugs, reluctance to fix them. I was a user and fan of iGuidance v2, but I cannot recommend iGuidance v3 until iNav addresses these issues:On a recent trip between Boston and Buffalo, iGuidance v3 plotted a route that paralleled US Interstate 90 instead of taking it - check any roadmap to see for yourself how silly this is. (And no, ""Route Options"" not set on ""local"" - the route it plotted never varied no matter which of the 4 available Route Options were selected.) When I passed a highway exit it wanted me to take, iGuidance should have simply recalculated the route, but instead it locked up my PDA. Finally, it repeatedly advised me to take illegal u-turns on the Official Vehicles crossovers.I work in software development and I know that every application has bugs. The concern comes when a manufacturer doesn't want to fix them. When I notified iNav of this problem, they repeatedly insisted that it wasn't a malfunction, it was just how their algorithm worked.To be fair -- finally, reluctantly, iNav Support agreed to check their code. But I will remain suspicious of any software developed by a company that claims that their algorithm is OK even when it fails so obviously in a real-world situation.",1

I gave Logitech another chance, returned the unit for a replacement.  I was astonished to find that the second unit had the exact same problem.

I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones",1

1489,"20 pounds max. I bought this mount because I wanted to be able to adjust both the vertical and horizontal alignment of my new HDTV panel.  The product description says this item can handle up to 50 pounds.  My panel is about 44 pounds and the vertical adjustment simply cannot handle the weight of the panel.  I used the ""heavy load"" bolt that's supposed to take care of this but it doesn't even come close.  The TV doesn't just slip down a bit.  It just sags against the wall.  I can't imagine this mount could hold up a panel over 20 pounds without assistance.FWIW, the mount does feel sturdy and it can hold the panel securely.  I'm using a block of wood to offset the bottom of the panel from the wall.  I'll replace that with a V-shaped brace that acts as a cable guide and will let the horizontal swivel function of the wall mount to work properly.Also, the screws included with the mount were too small.  They didn't fit my TV and the screw heads were so small, they slipped through the larger 100mm mounting holes.  The lag bolts provided had little hex heads meant to be tightened with the included allen wrench.  Terrible.  Who wants to screw nearly 3 inches of bolt into a stud with an allen wrench?!?  I replaced them with 5/16x3"" lag bolts and used a socket wrench.  I understand they're trying to make a simple installation but there's no way to get around the fact that the holes for the mount need to be drilled into the stud.  Anyone who has a drill will have a proper set of wrenches for driving proper bolts.I only gave this two stars because, after a trip to the store for proper screws, and with the addition of a bracket to provide the proper offset, this mount seems like it will hold my TV off the floor and allow me to swivel it from side to side.  However, I wouldn't recomment this product for any panel over 15 pounds.  20 tops",1

1492,"Very Disappointed. Received this as a Christmas present and was initially excited about it. The setup application worked well and I was able to enter all of my devices and create activities. After many hours of ""tweaking"" the activities functions I returned the device very disappointed. Here are the reasons I was disappointed1.	The letters/numbers on the buttons and screen were too small for me to read2.	The number buttons were at the bottom of the remote in a very inconvenient location3.	The buttons were too close together and too small making it difficult to press the correct button without activating adjacent buttons4.	When watching a DVD I sometimes use the TV for the sound source or use the Receiver for the sound source. Although I can program two activities (one for RCVR Sound and one for TV Sound) it can't automatically mute the sound of the device that you don't want to be the sound source. As a result it takes manual intervention to turn the sound down on the device you aren't using. This makes the remote entirely useless for my purpose as I wanted to be able to provide my spouse a single button to push for the ""activity"" she wanted without having to use other controls or remotes.So I'm impressed with the theory behind the remote I just think it needs some more work to perfect it",1

I am surprised that Amazon did not catch-on/up with the problem.The product won't retain any info then I had to store less and less information on the card, so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours. I decided to contact Amazon, they were very shortly, and cordially sent me a replacement Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), with the paperwork for returning the original Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768).Then I got something that:A.

Both cards I received had a problem. And therefore, it is safe to assume that Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) production have a major glitch. I mean, the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes. I have to yet see what or for what, other than memory, can I utilize a memory card. I beg your pardon, but in essence I am trying to imply that... The Sandisk products were a joke! :-).Being the consistent e-merchant that Amazon always been, Amazon agreed to return them. This was not a surprise (coming from Amazon).In essence, I strongly urge any person that makes a living, and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to:1.	Not be fooled. If you see Sandisk, run away as fast as possible,2.	You'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so.3.	Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is not compatible with data storage! or even short transfers of data, from a home computer to work.4.	Spend the extra.... on an alternative brand.5.	That's the only way you'll get a CF card that is correctly labeled; and, serve intended functions.6.	I strongly recommend, as well as urge individual who is thinking of  getting that ""other"" brand of 2-giga...... cards to make sure do so:................7.	Use Amazon only, and don't be fooled by any other e-merchant who's not as high of an echelon as Amazon....... Amazon!8.

WRONG!Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan",1

They make a good surround sound system with the Sony 3 speaker set for surround sound, but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub.  These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes",1

Driving on the freeways insouthern  california, don't expect to hear the navigated directions with the window down.Same goes for trying to use the bluetooth in making phone calls.  That's even with thevolume cranked all the way up.   I can hear the radio just fine with the windows rolled down.Although it's a nice thought of adding custom POI's, such as for safety cameras out here.The directions almost require you to have a technical degree,  to upload them.Garmin if you are reading this,  make it easy on the novice and test your products better.If someoone wants to add a custom POI, make it easy by having an icon that will automaticallylog the location you are at as a custom POI.Also do a better job of testing the products for volume controls with the windows up and downin various traffic areas, conjested or not",1

1516,"Slow and Unreliable. The 2.0 GB SanDisk Cruzer Micro flash drive looked like a good deal when I saw it on display at Office Depot.  It was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files, was rated for USB 2.0, and was reasonably priced.  My first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 GB Iomega I use at work, but, alas, such wasn't available.Unfortunately, I waited too long to put the SanDisk through its paces, or I would have tried to get a refund.  As many others have remarked, it is horribly slow.  While backing up my roughly 10,000 files, I found that it was taking about a second per file -- longer for the big ones.  This translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation.Bulk deletes take just as long to carry out.Using my Beyond Compare file synchronization software to *read* the SanDisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until, for no obvious reason, it hung on one particular Word document this evening.  I couldn't even get my Windows XP machine to shut down without yanking the SanDisk from its slot:  the usual ""safely remove hardware"" operation wouldn't work.  After three attempts to read the same file, and three reboots, I tried to delete it from Windows Explorer -- and this operation hung too.  Finally I was able to do the deletion from the DOS prompt.  Just like 1985!  I then recopied the file, and now Beyond Compare can finish its work without a hitch.But can I trust the SanDisk to deliver up my precious files when I really need them?  I dunno ....So, it's back to the drawing board.  Maybe by now Iomega has come out with that 2.0 GB model.  As for the SanDisk, I'm reminded of that painful adage:  you get what you pay for.Ugh",1

Sound quality. Second? Battery life. Anything after that is icing.The sound completely sucks on this phone. There is a constant hum and the voices sound slightly distorted and low. Whle changing the volume does increase the decibel level, it also increases all the annoying sound coming from this phone.If youre looking for the same quality phone that your old 900/2.8 had, good luck.

A few thoughts.1)  Many indicate that the speaker will sound better by adjusting your receiver.  True.  And that holds true for any speaker.2)  It is a slim design.  True.  At the same time, you can find a few others that are just as small or smaller.  I would say that it is a matter of personal preference of style.  What I find is that the Bose VCS-10 works out great with my old Sony 36"" WEGA from 5 years ago.  About the right size.  But switching to a 55"" widescreen...it doesn't look right and not integrated.The best advice I can give is to go listen to the speaker for yourself and inspect the construction...and how does it fit in your entertainment center.  Compare to other speakers for sound and appearance.The biggest advice is in a home theatre...make sure to get an excellent center channel.

It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.My recommendation is don't buy this model!!",1

I never accuse companies of raping consumers, because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend, but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance.  If you want to connect your iPod to your home stereo, get a $7.00 ""stereo mini-plug to RCA plug Y-adapter"" at Radio Shack.  That's all you need.  Because you already have a recharger (it came with your iPod), the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your iPod upright. I have this item (it came free with my 40GB iPod) and, although it offers a slight convenience over not having it, the price is a terrible rip-off.",1

My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration",1

I kept trying them because a) my first TiVo box was (and still is) using one of these successfully, and b) it's the one TiVo recommends!I finally gave up and bought a Netgear USB adapter - it is MUCH more subtantial and worked perfectly, plug 'n play.WHEN (and I'm sure it WILL) the original one breaks (if I accidentally tug on the cable or something silly like that) then I will also replace THAT one with a Netgear.I cannot recommend this product at all",1

1580,"There are three different versions with this model number. The original version of this router was version 1000, based on the same platform as Belkin's F5D8230-4 Pre-N and the Linksys WRT54GX routers using Airgo's v1 technology and a Broadcom engine.  It got an excellent review from Tom's Networking guide.Then Belkin put a whole new circuit bard inside the same case and called it Version 2000.  It used Airgo's v2 technology and a Realtek engine, and got roundly criticized on the equipment forums for being an inferior product.The latest version is 3000, which isn't even based on Airgo technology any more.  Now Belkin is using Ralink technology, and it's essentially the same router as the Airlink AR-525W, SparkLAN WRTR-300 or Compusa's store brand MIMO router, any of which can be found in stores for about 25 bucks.  The version 3000 technology bears no resemblance to the Airgo version that got such a good review at Tom's.  In fact, the router with the Ralink chipset (the Airlink) came in dead last and was the only one to receive a rating of ""not recommended"" in Tom's roundup.Of course there's no way to tell in advance which version you'll get, but it's a pretty good bet you'll get the latest one.  The only way to tell is to look at the sticker on the bottom of the box.This practice of changing the internal electronics without changing the model number is a really annoying practice.  It's hard enough to do all your research and decide which model to buy, so then to end up with something entirely different from what you thought you were getting is just maddening.  Your best bet is to just stay away from this one",1

It doesn't matter how much it's in use (it's done it when we've been on vacation with minimal network traffic).I called Netgear to get it replaced, but they told me that it's not meant to be plugged in all day, so they won't fix it.

I bought it in September 2004, and by January 2005, I'd returned it because the blue paint was peeling off.  PALM was pretty awful to deal with.  It was returned to me in April or May.  When they did return the device, it would not sync properly.  I called PALM and they gave me the run around, telling me it was my PCs problem, my company's problem, etc.  They wouldn't take it back.  Then the warranty expired and they wouldn't take it back, and quite frankly I was exhausted by the whole thing and stopped using it for a couple of months.  Finally, in January 2006 I decided just to use it for its organizational tasks and forget the syncking.  Now, June 7, that just broke and I am throwing it away",1

1591,"Product Has Bugs, Customer Service Won't Help!!!. I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying ""I can't believe you Americans"" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again.By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.Jeff",1
1592,"Great service if you never plan on canceling. I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player.",1
1593,"""Improved""? The new version is garbage!. It's true, CL has ""improved"" this product.  In the process they ruined it.  For one thing, they removed several features, for instance the new version does not have the removable fast file and lacks the slot for a label on the handle.  Also, it is about 30% lighter, and obviously ""cheaper"" in many respects, e.g the sides are now lightweight nylon.  I would be surprised if one of these new models holds up for even 30% as long as the old one. And it's UGLY: brown stitching on black faux leather looks awful!There is one actual improvement in the new one - it was easier to open flat on a table.  And one possible improvement - the attachment of the handle is apparently different, but you can't really tell if it's any better because it is hidden on the new one.You can't blame Amazon - the new and the old one have the same UPC code (8585405012).  But they are different part numbers: old = #60 2233002, new = #63-2400017-A.I am disgusted with Case Logic for this crass and brazen attempt to squeeze a few pennies out of the production cost at the cost of huge loss of quality.

1595,"HORRIBLE!. HORRIBLE is the only word I can think of to describe this product.  I'll preface my comments by saying that I do not consider myself to be an audiophile.  I am an average guy who wanted to be able to listen to my Sirius Sat Radio or iPod throughout my house and in my backyard while relaxing or entertaining.  Here was my experience with these speakers -I received them on Friday, they were very easy to setup, and connected easily to my Sirius receiver in my Office.  The first thing I didn't like about the speakers was that even when connected to the power supply they were not very loud.  At max volume in a quiet office, they were at a decent volume but not what I consider to be loud.  More of a background ambience level, not a pure listening volume.I then took the speakers into my backyard.  I set them on my patio roughly 20 feet from the transmitter, but outside of my brick house.  The sound quality was HORRIBLE.  Lots of popping, hissing and drop outs, while only 15 feet from the transmitter.  I opened my windows in my office, tried all 3 of the avaialble channels, nothing improved the reception.  When I could hear these speakers, at full volume they were barely loud enough to hear about 10 feet away from the speakers.  It was impossible to hear them at all in the furthest corner of my yard.  I tried moving the speakers to that corner of the yard and completely lost the signal from the transmitter about 50 feet from my house - nothing but static at that point.This morning I took the speakers into my Kitchen - roughly 40 feet from the transmitter with 2 walls between - the only place I could get a signal on the speakers was sitting them on top of my Fridge.  While there was no popping while in the Kitchen, the hissing was considerably more pronounced in the house.  The volume was good while in the kitchen and could be heard anywhere within that area - but that also includes hearing the hissing throughout the entire space.This morning I contacted Amazon to return these speakers since they did not meet my expectations.  To add insult to injury Amazon will be charging me to return the speakers as well as the shipping to send them to me.  Since they were over $25 I got the ""FREE"" Super Saver shipping.  I guess it's only ""FREE"" if you keep the item, if you return it Amazon will charge you.  Therefore, it's going to cost me about $20 to find out these speakers are HORRIBLE!As a solution for all of you who are looking for the ability to hear your music in every room of your house.  Do an Amazon search for ""Whole House FM Transmitter Gold"".  For less than these speakers you can buy a Whole House FM Transmitter and pick up your Sat Radio, iPod, TV, etc off of a crystal clear FM Signal.  I received one of these units yesterday as well and I am keeping this.  It produced a signal I could pick up on every radio inside and outside of my House including my Basement.  I will replace these Sony wireless speakers with an under cabinet radio for my Kitchen and a Boombox for my backyard.My recommendation is to AVOID these HORRIBLE SRS-RF90RK speakers",1

The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the ""Verify Written Data"" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN!

Good thing that I didn't care about how good the software would be, because the software for this is, in a word, deplorable.It doesn't have support for ANY other label sheets other than the memorex brand, which leaves you stuck with their labels. Its got some nice features in the software, but their poorly implemented. For instance, it can automatically resize an image to fit a CD/DVD, but if you've rotated it before that, the rotation is lost. It has a lot of minor quirks like that, and they add up to an annoyance to use this.If you get this product, find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator",1

This clock looks good and has a nice feature set, but while it may make a nice travel clock (if your cell phone won't do) it's really not suitable for regular use.* While the time is displayed in nice large numbers, the contrast is low and the display is hard to read in all but the brightest light. The display is set comparatively deep within the bezel and tends to chop off the right side of the last seconds digit, unless you view it fairly straight on. The date and temp are small, and can only be read from fairly close up.* As others have noted, you can't read the display if you are looking up at it, as when it's on your bed's headboard. You have to sit up a bit, or twist the clock.* The clock is smaller than it may look from the picture, and the base is narrow.

But this was not the worse of it.  Most disappointing is the detail of map details.  Tokyo, for example, has virtually no landmarks and one or two roads (this for a city of 11 million people!).  This seems to be consistent with other locations in Asia.  Even if this product was free and included when the unit was purchased, it would be disappointing.  In other words, it's not even worth it if it were free.I purchased it in December 2005 and it still required a patch to run on Windows XP Service Pack 2, more than a year after it was released.Consistent with Magellan's misguided restriction on not shipping any products except to a few countries, I had to have this product shipped to a family member in the USA who in turned shipped it to me.Clearly the ""Global"" in GPS does not apply to Magellan's approach to service and support.Magellan makes good hardware and should stick to that rather than trying to overcharge for inept software.Had I known the software support is so poor for Magellan products, I would have chosen an other GPS manufacturer such as Garmin",1

1623,"Can't really recommend this unless ya want a pretty light. I've had this product in my windowed Lian-Li PC-60 for about 5 months now.  I had bought it for 2 reasons:  to light up my case, and to help cool my 6800gt.  Now the former it does pretty well-it is impressive to look at through the window (and it's easier to install than a cold cathode light).  However, as an intake fan, it seems to bring in more dust than air (and my PC is in a finished basement that I try to keep tidy).  At any fan setting other than low, the VCool's fan noise is noticeable over my other fans (3 Aerocool 80mm, 2 92mm Thermaltake Silent Cats, and the 120mm cooling my Enermax Liberty PSU), especially on the highest setting.  But over the past month the VCool has started to do something particulary annoying-at bootup, the VCool would rev up to a very high speed, regardless of the setting on it's fan control.  The first time it did it, I thought a cable had snarled into one of my case fans-that's how loud it is.  I don't have the VCool hooked up to another fan control, and I'm just using a standard molex connector to power it, and there's a free PCI slot between it and my 6800gt, so there's no obstruction to cause the racket;  I'm at a loss for the cause of it's behavior.  It only did this sporadically at first, but within the past week, it has become a guarranteed occurance from a cold boot.  The fan does quiet down eventually, but I feel the noise it now generates, the fact that the intake is unfiltered, along with the fact that I now have an Arctic Silencer for my video card (the VCool can't reach the intake of the cooler, even with it's extension attached), outweighs whatever decorative purpose it had",1

1626,Annoying popping noises. I've had these speakers for about 3 years now and I'm really not happy them. There is some hissing but that is to be expected with wireless speakers. The most annoying thing is the popping noises. I have tried moving the speakers closer to the transmitter only to find that the distance makes no difference. I thought the popping noise was some kind of local interference so I actually walked all around the yard but the noise stayed the same. I got a warranty replacement of the transmitter because when I moved the attached antenna it caused static in the speakers and I thought perhaps the antenna was somehow not properly connected inside the housing but the popping noise persisted.I can't recommend these speakers. Best to consider others.,1
1627,Don't Bother. Not a worth while purchase.  You will be wasting your money on headphones that work some of the time. When your tv is getting low volume feed (soft/whisper dialogue for example) you'll get nothing but static - imagine watching a movie and going through this every 5-10 minutes).  I was told from RCA that this is unavoidable and that I should consider using the headphones for listening to stereo music only.

Also, they do have huge ""wall warts"" - the big converters (?) on the cords.  Finding an inconspicuous place to plug them in is impossible, since all the inconspicuous places are behind furniture, which can't be put close to the wall anymore for the size of the things on the plugs.

1637,"Poor Product. Despite not being written on the packaging or website my HP iPaq RX3417 was compatible with this keyboard.Unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad, clogging my PDA making it run very slowely. As well as this, it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change.In terms of hardware, I found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem. While targus does include all 5 rows of a standard keyboard, it shrinks the top row (numbers) and the bottom row (space bar). This makes it very difficult to use the space bar (which is for some reason split into three parts) and the numbers (which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way). I found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register. In terms of key position, there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult. Some keys are also very small (e.g. the right shift key and backspace) making them difficult to use (strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards).One of the biggest problems I had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys. Targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen. This mouse cursor is useful, but needs to be supplemented with normal Up, Down, Left and Right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document. Using the mouse to do this is very frustrating.The final negative thing about this keyboard was the price. I paid AUD$149.95 for this keyboard. Doing some research on the internet found better models (i.e. Think Outside Stowaway IR Keyboard) available for less than half the price (around AUD$70) and bluetooth keyboards available for less than AUD$190. I think it might be about time Targus releases a new model PDA keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get. No more tiny keys and no more than two space bars",1
1638,Annoying scroll. In less than 1 year the scroll wheel starting sticking which means that when you want to use it for scrolling the computer recognizes it as if you are pushing down the scroll wheel.  The length of the wire is about 3-4 inches shorter than it should be,1
1639,"Not worth getting unless they fix the software first. This is for a  PowerMac G5, or so the label says. I haven't tried this on older G4 computers so I don't know if this really needs a driver that's built in a G5 or something.I got this for the heck of checking what it can do for me. Nothing really.1. First of you have to know that this adapter connects to the DVI port, not the old ADC port. What this means is that the Aluminum displays for the G5 model use DVI. This being the case, then you have a problem right there to fight over the port. Unless you have the high-end optional nVidia GT card with dual-DVI port, then the stock ATI 9600/9800 cards come with one DVI and one ADC. So I would think people with G5 have or are thinking of upgrading to the Aluminum display then you will be needing an ADC to DVI converter to hold the monitor and TV at the same time. That makes using the two ""monitors"" with respective adaptors. Why?! Unless Apple envisioned phasing out the ADC port soon, it makes no sense. And if they did envision to phase out the ADC then why release cards with the G5 that still have an ADC port if the new monitors use DVI and this adapter also uses DVI. Are they trying to make money selling adapters?2. I haven't seen a perfect computer to TV interface from major video card manufacturers the same way Matrox has perfected it. What Matrox has done for dual monitors with one using a TV is that it automatically routes the video signal to the TV. If it detects your playing a movie file, it just brings it out to the TV as a full screen. No need to drag your windows into that screen and then making it into full screen. This adapter and the software interface doesn't do it. It just makes your TV into another monitor with extremely low resolution, naturally. The point of adding a TV as a monitor is to obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable and hassle-free. If you play a QuickTime file or a DVD movie in your computer, you would want it to be played on your TV. Nope, not here. You will have to drag it then make it full screen.But it doesn't stop there. Try opening another application and that full screen on the TV monitors automatically switches back into one within a window. Very stupid and annoying. So I believe they should follow the footsteps of Matrox and create a custom software that will allow to do just that. Put a check box if you want your video automatically output on the TV, on a window, in the first monitor, second monitor, etc.3. The above suggestion actually works with Final Cut Pro application. But if you're a video editor, you really wont even need this. You see once you connect your TV via this adapter then you can route your TV as your monitor which is good to check the actual picture quality on a TV screen. It is a cheap solution.  However, if you are editing on Final Cut Pro then it would be natural that you have either a video editing card that can output to a TV/monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active for editing. Or, you have a camcorder with FireWire output or some other similar solution that you can use to route from the computer to camcorder to TV. Using FireWire is actually a better solution that this adapter because it DOES NOT allocate video card memory to the TV via the adapter. By using the adapter to connect to the TV you are eating up video memory between the computer monitor and the TV. So if you have 128MB memory then 64MB goes to each. This slows down the video information and will be evident if you are using big computer screens. By using FireWire the video card does not interfere and allocates full memory to your computer monitor.4. The OS isn't even perfect with interfacing to the adapter. You connect the adapter and you'll need to constantly restart the computer whenever you connect/disconnect it. Simply putting the computer to sleep and waking it won't work. Your video card still thinks the TV is connected despite having no TV nor adapter (after waking from sleep). Shut down the computer, remove the adapter then start to make sure all video card memory is allocated back to your computer monitor.So unless you have a high end video card that can afford to split the memory and an interface that automatically routes the video signal to your TV, this is pretty useless. It's just for fun to prove that you can output part of your screen to your TV with hassle and all. Skip until they improve the software",1

My issues are:- Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones.

Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them.- Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture.- Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer.

This is the case even though most of my components are pretty mainstreem stuff (Sony KV-30HS420, Denon AVR-1801, Panasonic DMR-ES10, DirecTV H20) THere is no facility in logitech's online software to let them know that their data is AFU. So much for ""continually updating our database""! Making this work has been a HUGE time sink. The software is stupid and beurocratic, sometimes asking irrelevant questsions (e.g. ""What input does the DVD player use?"" when you're setting up to watch the satellite.) While cheaper than some, the unit is  very expensive compared to other universal remotes I *should have* bought (e.g. Sony RMVL600",1
1661,Adorable Decorations but they Sound Awful. These are irresistably cute but they sound terribly tinny and they are unbearable for more than five minutes.  I regret giving them to someone I love as a gift.  They are now sitting on his desk as a decoration and he's still using his old speakers.  I know you might not be able to stop yourself from buying these; don't expect a pleasant listening experience from these speakers.,1
1662,"Surprisingly serious shortcomings. I work on a helpdesk where our employer purchased a set of CS10s (along with a set of older-style lifters for which I cannot find a model number) to allow us to move freely about the office while taking support calls. While generally very functional, they exhibit a few *very* severe problems. We have gone through a total of nine of them without resolving these issues:The units will, seemingly at random, produce incredibly loud feedback to both sides of the connection. This seems to be related to the phono jack on the remote unit, but also depends on physical location (some areas experience this more frequently than others; so far, air conditioning seems a likely cause).The units will periodically bleed across channels. Changing channel on the remote unit or range on the base unit does not affect this -- you will be treated to static and the combined calls of all other units in the area, typically until you replace the remote unit (although the remote units appear to correct themselves after time).They also exhibit frustratingly poor lifter response (even after replacing our older lifters with HL10s). This appears to be a duplexing problem; when placing an outgoing call, the lifter responds fine, but if a call is being received, then the signal used to ring the remote unit (even if ringing is turned off) appears to block the lift signal, not only failing to answer the call but also preventing you from using the Talk button for 5-10 seconds afterward. When this happens multiple times in a row, it becomes entirely impossible to answer the phone at all.I am very surprised to read so many favorable reviews. After having replaced every single unit at least once, we still find them to be barely adequate for our operations. I do not believe that we have received defective units every single time, nor that our environment is unusual in how we use them. I recommend all potential buyers approach this product with caution",1
1663,"If only it could receive FM stations. I've been using this radio for about six months now.  I don't actually use it very often because of the poor reception; I have an old cassette walkman that gets better FM reception and gets used more often.  The good points on this radio are (1) simple to use, (2) small and light, (3) only uses one AAA battery, which lasts a long time, and (4) has weather band.  However, the FM reception is very poor. Signal separation is very poor, even when listening to powerful local stations.  Reception quality varies greatly with minor movement of the headphone cord.  In general, acceptable reception is only possible in open-air sites, with careful positioning of the radio and headphone cord, and while remaining immobile.  I plan to discard this unit and buy a Sangean",1
1664,"Interior decays... This is a solid case, but after some months of use, I have 2 complaints.  One is that the stylus falls out because of the way the case is designed.  The other is that while the soft interior is protective, it has begun to deteriorate, leaving ""dust"" on the Ipaq.  There are few hard cases out there, however, so I would purchase this again if I needed one",1
1665,"BEWARE SAMSUNG DLP DESIGN FLAWS!!!. Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to ""turn it off"", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!I have a 42"" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26"" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP",1

At first I thought that maybe I needed to adjust to the new mouse, or better yet, perhaps adjust the sensitivity.Option 1: You cannot adjust the sensitivity.

1668,"Good except the compact flash card gets stuck. I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.Not a quality reader.Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. ""Eject"" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader",1

1672,"I hate this Palm. I have been using a Palm for the past 6 years and this is by far the worst.  It is constantly crashing.  I had to get rid of all my fun custom programs which is why I used to love the Palm so much.  The touchscreen is SLOW!  (I'm guessing because of the Flash memory)  It is hard to really  get good use out of it.  Even the most trivial things are wrong with this Palm, like there is no power light.  This means you can't tell whether or not it is charging.  I'm so angry about that.  It often takes several nights of me plugging it in, thinking it is charging all night only to wake up and realize that the cable (mind you, they got rid of the cradle) was loose.  It is a good thing that it uses Flash memory because I have drained the battery several times with this circus act.  I don't like the new big size.  It doesn't fit into my old reliable case which I had for 6 years and was very secure.  I like to clip the palm to my belt.  This thing is so big that it is constantly hitting my leg when I sit down and falling off.  So, I keep it in my bag now and don't use it nearly as much as I used to.I loved the old Palms so much, they were quick, adaptable, portable and decently reliable.  But this thing is a clunking pain in the butt.  I am really ready to at least investigate the Pocket PC's.",1
1673,"Scans well - hard to use images afterwards. I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important.CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.",1

1682,"Cute, but on a short leash. I just drove 120 miles round trip to buy this mouse from a brick and mortar store, because I wasn't sure about the size.  For people with small hands, a regular mouse is ergonomically uncomfortable, and it is sometimes hard to find a small size mouse.  The grip is great and the feel is fine.  This is one of a very few mouses labelled as Vista compatible, so the choices are limited.  For a laptop pc, this mouse is probably ok.  But the USB cord is less than 2 1/2 feet long.  Thus, if you're using a big new Microsoft ergonomic keyboard (which has no onboard USB port) and a full pc, this mouse is not suitable.  I suppose one could place the PC on the desktop, but that's an irrational use of space.  But its probably the better plan than moving your desk so the PC is within 2 1/2 feet of your right hand.  I preferred the off-brand Micro Innovations travel mouse with its longer 4-foot cord, but my new Microsoft Office software queers it off (although my old XP software on an earlier computer didn't) and that is why I bought this one.  Microsoft should redo excel, add a generous mouse cord to this model, add a USB port to its 4000 keyboard, and certify other companies' mice so folks know what will work.

1703,"Scans OK  but very poorly constructed. First, let me say that I could not review this product completely as it quit working after about 20 scans (30 minutes after charging it for the first time).  I did have the chance to perform scans at 100, 200, 400 dpi as well as in black and white, 12- and 24-bit color.  I was also able to install the software and import about 10 scans into my computer.It did scan photos well (at both 200 and 400 dpi), but it was tough to get the images to scan in perfectly vertical.  At the higher resolution and higher color (24 bit), the scanning process took to long (about 12 seconds for a full page).  When scanning  at 200 dpi and 12-bit color it took about 8 seconds per page.  Also, the scanner actually turns off after each scan, thus it takes 15-20 seconds and button pushing to reboot the device before scanning another page.  Importing 7 images from the device to my laptop (while it was still working) took about 4 minutes.  The OCR software (Paperport) was good, but the scan quality (Black and white and 100 dpi) was too poor to allow it to be functional.  The 8MB internal memory is not enough and the 128MB or 256MB expansion card is definitely needed.What I was most shocking was the very poor craftsmanship.  There were seams on the device where the plastic was glued.  One of the  two main buttons was recessed into the device.  Also, the indicator lights were misaligned with the overlying symbols.  I cannot emphasize enough how poorly made this was.  I am returning it for a full refund (30 day money back and 90 day exchange - if bought from Planon).DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!Addendum (April 20th 2006):  I have had a very difficult time dealing with the Planon company.  To return this product within the first 30 days and get a full refund, you must first get an authorization which required no fewer than 7 phone calls and 5 e-mails.  Once I finally had returned it, they said they had credited my charge when they never did.  Upon calling them they said it would ""take some time"" to see the credit come through... That was 6 weeks ago.  They do not return phone calls or e-mails and in order to return this it has required alot of time and effort.  There business practices (product quality, customer service, and return policy) are poor at best.  I will re-emphasize: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT",1

Unfortunately, the AVB cassette adapter did not work with the cassette player on my car stereo. In case this is of any help, it was a stock pioneer head unit on a lexus sc300.It might just be that I received a defective adapter, or it is not compatible with my car. Either way, the car never recognized it, after trying multiple times, it kept making a noise that sounded like it was spinning and even if it had read the adapter, the noise coming from it was too loud to hear the music over it.I ended up returning it and purchasing a Dynex DX-CA101 and that one worked fine and worked quietly",1

After a few months of light use, the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 mA batteries should.  If I use the batteries immediately after charging them, I can take about 20 pictures (while my 2000 mA NiMH batteries can do &#62;60).  If I charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves, they won't be useful after only a week.The charger is capable of charging both AA and AAA batteries.  But a few months ago, 1 spring for switching between AA and AAA stopped working properly.  This was after very light use.  I only charge AAA batteries once a month.The market for NiMH batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago.  I would not buy this Kodak if I were to buy today",1

I found clearer ones by manually searching.  When it's connected to your ipod, it definetly slows down the menus.  The buttons on the iCarPlay 200 are also very unresponsive.  I would press the change station button, nothing happened, then press it again, then it would jump twice.  So my advice is have patience when navigating the iCarPlay's menus.  Sometimes I could get it to work with an acceptable amount of static, but then the unit would randomly stop working, and i get blasted with noise from my radio being cranked up.  You cannot adjust the volume on the iCarPlay, only on your radio.  I returned the unit, and I am in the process of getting a pioneer head unit with a built in auxillery input on the front panel.  I cannot recommend this unit.  It also looks cheap for the price point.  It looks like it should cost about $25 dollars.  One postive note, it does charge the Ipod fairly quickly.  Also in my wifes car, where she a factory stereo the static wasn't quite as annoying.  I have amplified tweeters which pick up everything, including static.  I also thought that putting the unit closer to the stereo would improve the sound, oddly it doesn't seem to make a difference.

1712,"Cheap cordless solution. Mediocre voice volume. TERRIBLE with VoIP (i.e. Vonage). I bought this phone to replace an older VTech 2426 phone (which incidentally is a far superior model). I saw that the 5823 is 5.8 GHz and on the merits of not interfering with the wireless network traffic buzzing around my house, I bought it.This proved to be a terrible mistake. Caller ID functionality for Vonage mysteriously stopped working even though this phone's REN is rated at 0.1b. I spent weeks on the phone with tech support.Additionally,the voice quality is terrible. Any time we make long distance calls we are constantly told that it sounds like we are conversing into the handset from across the room. We have to yell to make ourselves (barely) heard.Out of desperation, I used my rudimentary electronics skills to put my old 2.4GHz Vtech 2426 back together. I cleaned it up, dusted it out, charged it, and guess what. Voice quality is back. Caller ID is functioning once again as well. Regardless of whether you have Vonage, I would avoid the 5823 phone altogether.For Vonage users, however, it is an absolute no-no. Save yourself months of misery and frustration",1

I did not carry mine around, for one, it is too heavy. I also only fired it up when I did my monthly backups, so I didn't have it running all the time, so it shouldn't have over heated as others have mentioned. But after less than 11 months, the computer stopped recognizing it---it hums but never gets anywhere. I changed the ports, bought new cables, all to no avail.

Their suggestions to use a data recovery application is unhelpful since I couldn't see the drive to select it. They don't even give you a toll free number to call. They also expect you to pay to ship the heavy thing to them even under warranty. They give NO HELP to retrieve data. If you allow anyone to open the case it voids the warranty, but they won't send you the hard drive separately, even if you send them the item intact and it turns out that it's something else.Head aches, head aches....if it worked, it would be great, but it's not the drive that is important, it is the data and if Lacie hasn't figured out a way to help clients when their products fail, they shouldn't be in this business.buyer beware!

Perhaps there's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box. I suggest you insist on this.

1729,"Poor Product. Despite not being written on the packaging or website my HP iPaq RX3417 was compatible with this keyboard.Unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad, clogging my PDA making it run very slowely. As well as this, it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change.In terms of hardware, I found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem. While targus does include all 5 rows of a standard keyboard, it shrinks the top row (numbers) and the bottom row (space bar). This makes it very difficult to use the space bar (which is for some reason split into three parts) and the numbers (which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way). I found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register. In terms of key position, there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult. Some keys are also very small (e.g. the right shift key and backspace) making them difficult to use (strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards).One of the biggest problems I had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys. Targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen. This mouse cursor is useful, but needs to be supplemented with normal Up, Down, Left and Right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document. Using the mouse to do this is very frustrating.The final negative thing about this keyboard was the price. I paid AUD$149.95 for this keyboard. Doing some research on the internet found better models (i.e. Think Outside Stowaway IR Keyboard) available for less than half the price (around AUD$70) and bluetooth keyboards available for less than AUD$190. I think it might be about time Targus releases a new model PDA keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get. No more tiny keys and no more than two space bars",1

Don't believe that either. It's only just over 16"" wide, so there's just no way. It's also not going to work well if your studs are more than 16"" (for example 24"") apart.

Sad to say, the same is true of the Mini.As stated, my Sandisk Micro works like a champ and I've dealt with many of them, but none of the 10 Sandisk Mini's work with this menu/application system.Truly the sign of a cheap drive.

It just can't produce the accurate highs that come from a seperate tweeter, nor can it produce low end frequencies with any real presence (I am NOT referring to boomy bass here).

1745,"Misbegotten and hard to use -- really poor design for usability. This mouse is incredibly difficult to use. There's actually only one button: The whole carapace of the mouse. So your hand can't really be relaxed when you're using it, you continually have to concentrate in order to get true right-clicks. In order to get that true right-click, you want to grip the mouse -- but the only place on it that affords gripping without tending to cause false-clicks is the two little pads on the right and left side. Alas, if you grip those (in the default mode), you get Expose, which interrupts your attempt to right-click; if you reflexively follow through with the click, most of the time you'll get switched to another application (because hey, you just clicked on that app window in the Expose screen).The scroll ball is a nice idea, but it's about half the size it needs to be in order to afford a decent amount of control. Without that, you get all kinds of false directionals (scrolling right/left when you're trying to scroll up/down) And using the scroll-ball to center-click is tricky: as often as not, even after you configure the scroll-ball to click as ""button 3"", you as often as not get a funky ""mouse scrolling"" action (an icon appears on screen and you can scroll the currently focused document by moving the mouse pointer -- not a crazy idea, but totally counter-productive when what I wanted to do was open the clicked link in a new tab).Basically, this is a fussy, fussy device that will be difficult for most people to use.

If your serious about a true instrument, stick with the known brands and visit a music store to learn more about what would be appropriate. The real ones (child size) can be found for around 100.00 so it's worth it.",1

1751,"Not good. The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution",1

1758,"re: Absolutely terrible. To celebrate the anniversary of our company, we thought we'd give all employees a gift.  Our Apple phobic IT guys nixed the Ipod as a choice, despite the CEO and CTO both owning and recommending them, so we went with the Zune.  Of the 50 we bought, 16 had to be exchanged for quality issues.  We've had issues with the drivers on the Vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the XP machines.  Several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones.We can't use them as data drives so they're not as useful as we'd like.  Finally, store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why DRM is applied to files if you share them.  Which reminds me, the wireless is half baked; too slow and we've had plenty of hang ups while trying to share.The end of the story is that the CEO is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle.  He has already said in no uncertain terms that when Apple ships a video ipod, the company will give those to make up for the Zune experience",1

The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.

(A blank screen or a green screen was the result.)  Unfortunately, given these problems, I returned the unit.  I think I'm going to look at an older ADS unit without the VBR feature to ensure quality, and then do any DivX transfers by software.

Once the notebook is inserted into the carrying case, it is nearly impossible to zip close. My wife uses it mostly and though the case appears durable and padded, getting the notebook inserted and the case zipped closed is difficult and very tight at best, the case needs more room to fit most 17 inch notebooks. We feared that the notebook would get damaged while trying to zip the case closed (we've owned numerous notebooks and cases over the last ten years).

1769,"Cheap made in china case. This case is another example of shoddy cheap made in china junk to save a buck.The design of the case is basically like that of a wire frame with inserts pressure fitted -- only there is really no pressure! These cases are made from very thin aluminum coated CARDBOARD inserts with felt glued to the back. Only the bottom insert has rivets, which are there primarily to hold the rubber feet on. All other inserts slide around within the cases, especially the large insert in the top of the lid. As you can imagine, the entire case bows and flexes with the lid closed, and flexing is far worse with the lid open. A full case would probably not withstand being dropped on a corner.Worse still, the inside of the case has reinforcing brackets to keep the inserts in, between each side, making the inside volume non-square. The lid has a full inch of space for jewel cases to bounce around in, and there is only one riveted U-channel piece of aluminum at the top of the base and the bottom of the lid, per division of the case's compartments. This will present a huge problem for those who want to put paper sleeved CDs and DVDs into the case since there is nothing to separate the bottom of the case.There is nothing to prevent liquids from penetrating the seams of the case. If liquid is spilled on the edges of the case, it will get in!If you close the lid and shake the case around, the hanging sleeves tend to come out of the U-channels and bounce around the inside of the case.The inside of the case smells like an old musty house in which air has not circulated for years.The case only comes with 25 hanging sleeves! You have to go to the atlantic-inc website and create an account and enter a ""promotional code"" to buy the remaining sleeves ""at the cost of shipping"" which is about another eight dollars.I made the mistake of purchasing two of these cases. Both cases came with scratches on the aluminum and rivets that look like they damaged the aluminum/cardboard panels going in, and will easily pop out.",1

I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.So in summary the current Lexar encryption software:- Can't be used on a Windows domain machine- Can't be used on an Intel Mac- Breaks the DVD on a PPC MacIt's not for me!However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay.",1

1794,"The good and the terrible. I have waited until I finally received a working model to post my experience with Logitech.First, let me begin by saying that now that I have a working Audio Station I really do love it.  The product deserves the excellent iLounge review it received.  The sound is great.  It has an audio in port and an S-Video out port on the back.  I cannot for the life of me understand why there are $300 units made by Apple and Bose that are nothing more than some speakers.  Additionally, the AM/FM tuner works well.  I really only use the FM tuner but have found it to be good - better than I expected but not perfect.  However, once again, most units at this price point do not have any sort of AM/FM tuner and that was a sacrifice I was not willing to make.  For all of these reasons I really do like the Audio Station.However, if there was even another product on the market with these characteristics (AM/FM, S-Video out, audio in) I would have taken my business elsewhere in a second.  My experience with Logitech was TERRIBLE.  First, I brought home a unit from Best Buy in early February and found that it was one of a bad batch that went out to Best Buy stores (see other reviews on this page for more details on which units have the problem with buttons not responding).  After the buttons on the front of the unit didn't respond I got online and read the reviews posted here on Amazon as well as on Logitech's own website where they finally admitted that this was a flawed product.  I then contacted Logitech to see about having a product sent to me as part of the warranty.The representative at Logitech told me I would be better off taking my unit back to Best Buy.  I realized that I knew more about the problem with the Audio Station than the customer service rep did after only about 20 minutes of poking around online.  I told him that apparantly a bad batch went out to Best Buy stores and the last thing I was going to do was to waste my time returning a product to Best Buy only to bring another faulty unit back home.  I also told him that I'd read that Audio Stations coming directly from the factory were reportedly working fine and I wanted one of those.  After some time on the phone we arranged for my unit to be picked up and then I would receive a new unit in 10 days.10 days later I called.  This was the first time I found out that the unit was out of stock and my order was on backorder.  I was furious that I had to call to find out the item was on backorder.  Not only was this the first I heard of the problem but there was nothing they could do for me.  I was told the first week of March they would recieve some in the warehouse.  I waited.  About 8 days into March I called again.  The order hadn't made it to the warehouse.  A small order was due to arrive but it was not guaranteed that I would get one of them.  Again, I was very displeased but there was nothing I could do.This was the first time that a customer representative seemed to know what he was talking about and actually served as an advocate for me.  To their credit, I did recieve a unit out of that first batch.  It arrived relatively quickly and works fine.  However, it was a terrible, terrible experience along the way.If you buy one of these, I guarantee buying directly from the factory.  Logitech does not seem inclined to recall their bad units and appears to be content with letting customers deal with their problem.  If you do buy from Best Buy or from Amazon, be careful - you may receive one of the flawed units and who knows how long it will take a replacement to get to you.  It basically took Logitech 7 weeks to get me a new model.  I've never had so much trouble giving a company $300 of my money.  I plan to never shop with Logitech again",1

1800,"Surprisingly Thin ""Tinny"" Sound. First, a little about myself as a listener.  I'm no audiophile, so I don't put any stock in the reviews from ""Bose Bashers"", or the claimed ""audiophiles"".  I know what I like when I hear it.  I have the Acoustimass 6 system attached to my home theater and I love it.  The size makes it unobtrusive when the object is to watch a movie, and the sound is really great.  For my den, I have the Polk LSi25 speakers attached to some high dollar gear, and the sound is awesome.  I've skimped on my computer speakers because I didn't see a use for high quality sound coming from the noisy box under my desk, but I'd hoped to change that with a nice set of Bose speakers that were unobtrusive like my home theater.I have a Logitech 5.1 THX system that sounded decent and it sounded better than these speakers at one-third of the price.  Since I moved my computer room to the attic, I can no longer mount the Logitech speakers due to the size/setup of this room.  So, I needed a 2.1 system.As for the Companion 5 system, the quality of the components is very good.  I like the control pod, and the setup was fast and easy; however, immediately apparent with the Companion 5 speakers is the thin tinny sound coming from the satellites.  It sounded like I was listening to my computer through a phone line.  Unlike the Acoutimass 6 system, I was very aware of the fact that all of the base was coming from the subwoofer, and I was equally aware of the location of the base module.  I checked the documentation for correct placement, and was discouraged to find out that I had indeed placed the speakers correctly.  Still, I moved things around, and around, and fiddled with the settings, and moved things around until I found a placement that delivered acceptable, though not really good, sound quality.  I had to place the subwoofer directly behind my monitor, with the satellites right next to the monitor to get a sound that would keep me from returning the system.I'm not thrilled with the Bose speakers, and I'll go back to my Logitech system if I relocate my desk again.  I wish I had a recommendation for a nice 2.1 system, but I wouldn't recommend the Companion 5 system to anyone looking for a good sound from a set of computer speakers.",1

Need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty, from unauthorized seller, or buying used.",1
1802,This product did nothing for me. I currently have 2 computers and use a wireless router for broadband connectivity.  The router and the second computer are on the same floor of my home--about 3 rooms apart.  I was receiving a low response connectivity on this second computer so I purchased the powerline adapters (I purchased 2 adapters and installed these according to the vendor's directions) based on other's glowing reviews and recommendations.This product did absolutely nothing for me.  My poor response/connectivity was the same either with or without the Netgear adapter so it was very disappointing,1
1803,"does not work, even with other D-link products... would not work with 624 D-link, even after several phone conversations and hours on the line with dlink technicians.  the techs couldn't offer any solution beyond what was written in the instructions and worse, they clearly did not care whether it worked or not -- they could not wait to just tell me to ship it back to amazon where I bought it from so they could get off the phone...  it was disgusting",1
1804,"Sony. Ever since Sony's Rootkit problem it has prompted me not to buy another sony product ever, and I won't. Even Cd-r blanks.  Who knows what there putting on these things.   As a matter of fact you guys need to read this right here.  http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2005-11-17-sony-rootkit_x.htmDon't buy SONY, they need to go out of business.  They are selling products that either people have problems with or damage their system like the BMG copy protected cd's.  I use memorex or Pengo Technologies for my blanks.   preferably memorex because you have to order Pengo from their website but they work great.  So I'd beware of sony products, especially ones that deal with cd's.  I bought some blanks from them and once i heard about the rootkits and how many results i got about it when i went to google i never trusted sony again.  Oh yeah and SONY stands for standard oil campany of new york.  They don't want you to know that because they are an ameircan made company and their name stands so high.  Luckily for me I don't buy sony Copy protected cd's anyway.  And now for sure I won't be.  There infecting people's computer with spyware, trojans and even depending on what BMG copy protected cd you get from them sometimes they can tell when you hit the play button to play a song in a media player.  All that stuff just from one BMG copy protected cd and you were actually suppose to get only the artist not the trojans and viruses on the cd.  They are doing this to try to stop people from copying cd's, bu they ahve took it way too far.  I think that in the future sony sells will swop downward",1
1805,"Caveat Emptor. I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case.  I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270.  This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it.  I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA.  Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.  My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA",1
1806,"Avoid like the plague. Three reasons why I will not touch any Corsair USB memory drive again:1) As the other reviewer pointed out (4 gig) ""The wide, thick rubber gasket surround the USB connector limits how far you can insert the connector into even lightly recessed USB receptacles"". I thought it was just mine! There is not enough metal exposed so it means the drive frequently disconnects, loosing valuable data in the process and crashing the PC often.2) Right from day one, the drive would show up as a USB Hub (I think it uses this to control 4 chips inside instead of a single chip). But this would at least 50% of the time cause any other device to be inserted into the same USB port on removing the memory drive not to be recognized - only a reboot would fix this. I tried this on many laptops/desktops and got the same results.3) I contacted Corsair who said to ship it back to them even though the local retailer would take it back. Since I was out the country I told them I was uncomfortable posting it internationally (back to them in Fremont, CA) using ordinary post (courier would have been 50% of what I could buy it new for). But they pushed for this without offering to pay for the post so ordinary post it went. They now claim not to have received it and now unlike the other reviewer I do not even have own a $100 paper weight.I'd like to say a lot of other things, but fear that Amazon will not print it, so lets leave it at the simple facts above. I don't think I have been so disgusted at a company of peripherals as much as Corsair. And for Corsair to validate what I have said is true, my RMA Number: R15300",1

1810,"Not worth the price+shipping. I bought these head phones because I read all the reviews that gave it 4's and 5's, so I expected a lot out of them. The truth is you really shouldn't...they don't sound particularly awesome and I was rather disappointed that I actually spent close to $30.00 after shipping and stuff. The mid-highs and highs sound fine, but I had issues with bass and mid-low response, especially when I plugged it into my computer. Plus they are not super comfortable either; the hinges nip at your neck when you don't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses.All in all, I wished i had spent my money on something else. But they do look pretty cool.",1

I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought this unit, I stopped working after used only a few times, then the ""no disk"" warning showed up with a perfect fine DVD in there, and pictures started to freeze up. Here is the funniest thing, I found if I shake it , it will continue to play, if I stop, it will freeze. So if you want a good exercise machine, this might be a good one, because my arms are so sore after shake-and-play for two hours",1
1812,Why have a five disk changer that cannot shuffle?. I purchased a Sony 5-disk CD changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks. This model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time. What were they thinking? The ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk CD/DVD player. THIS BABY IS GOING BACK,1
1813,"Horrible product. I bought this product for my Tivo and it broke within a few weeks. As other reviewers have said, the RJ45 connector is incredibly fragile and it's really not a question of if it will break but when. I recommend the Netgear FA120 instead.  Instead of a flimsy flip-up, you plug the Cat-5 directly into a sturdy box, and it puts less pressure on the Tivo's USB port.  How a big company like Linksys, with all it's money and brainpower, delivers such an obviously inferior product is beyond me",1
1814,"worst souding, best looking headphones ever!. I purchased these cans hoping the ney sayers were extreme audiophiles, and the praisers were average people. Turns out the ney sayers were average people like me. These Headphones have ZERO BASS, none. I love bass, I have had 15 + pairs of headphones, some of them $15-$20 dollars that have better bass. I thought maybe these might just have a nice clean sound un-poluted by heavy bass, I  would rather have a pair of tweeters on my ears. They look so good though, I actually took a decent pair of headphones and put the speakers from those in the Skull Candies. Let me tell you, it's the design of the cup, they made the good speakers sound like dooky. So if you want somthing that looks great around your neck, like jewlery, get these. If you want good headphones, get a pair of sennheisers(SP?). They have affordable stuff that sounds great",1

1817,"Won't play after 3 months. I purchased this boombox for my daughter's room.  Basically, we put in a CD at bedtime, and set the sleep timer for 30 minutes.  NOT heavy or detailed use ... I bought this unit because of the timer.  After 3 months, when you push the play button (either remote or manually) the machine would sporadically play the CD.  Usually after 2 or 3 'no disc' errors, and a power shutoff, it would eventually play.  Now it's completely a 'no disc' error message.  Of course, Sony's warranty person explained that it's a 90 day warranty ... imagine that!  A COMPLETE waste of my money.  If I'd have wanted a cheap machine to last a few months, I would have bought one.  I paid extra for this one so it would last!  I'll be hard pressed to buy Sony again!!!",1
1818,"Want to protect your iPod? Get something else. I just put this on 5 minutes ago, and I don't like it. Like some other reviews, I couldn't get out many of the air bubbles (13 of them) after putting it on (this is bad since two are on my video screen, and many are on the click wheel) and the back only covers a modest portion (the ""about 80%"" from another reviewer suggestion seems about right). You also have to be VERY careful putting it on. The only reason I even tried it out was because it was a gift from one of my coworkers, and she got them cheap in a 3-pack.To add insult to injury, the overlay is actually harder to clean than the iPod by itself. It has fingerprint marks all over it; usually fixed by a wipe with a clean cloth. I'll probably be taking this protector off relatively soon. Shame on Belkin for selling this product!If you want to protect your iPod, get something else that will protect it from impact as well. I have a slight chip (less than 4 mm) on mine on the front side after dropping it. It slipped out of my hand onto a concrete corner from about 5 feet. I figure that's pretty good protection on Apple's part, but that may have been avoided with a durable case. If you're going to get something, go for all around protection and not this",1
1819,"Great idea - poorly executed. I bought this with the hopes of consolidating/backing up files for home and work PCs.  I already had the drives, so this seemed like a good idea.  It took about 2 hours to configure the device the way I wanted to - a 200 MB mirror and a 50 MB non-mirror.  The mirrored partitions seem to have real problems.The speed reading/writing to the mirror are very slow, and the mirror partition keeps getting corrupted.  To fix the problem requires that you download and use a command line application.  I am technically capable, but I really don't like having to 'fix' the mirror partition whenever I want to use it.I have one PC that can't even run the application to attach the drives - it crashes when I open it.  Also mentioned in previous posts - it is annoying to have to load each PC with software to attach to the device.  The fact that it doesn't use NTFS or CLI format is another really annoyance - I have to copy these drives to another NTFS drive in order to recapture the files I have on this device (Windows, Linux, and Mac can't read the format of these drives).Summation: I would not buy this again.  I am now looking at the Linksys product; it would require me to buy two HD enclosures, but at least then I could actually use it",1

Each of them came with 4 AAA batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package. One of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use. Battery charger technology is not all that complicated but Kodak doesn't seem to have mastered it yet. No wonder they were practically giving these away. I'd avoid purchasing these now at any price,1
1823,A waste of money!. This factory refurbished model 360 GPS worked for about ten hours.  Initially it worked fine.  It then failed to pick up the satellite signal or would loose the signal as a drove along on a trip.  I called tech support for help twice.  The service personnel are very difficult to understand and they also have trouble understanding me.  It is a language issue.  They suggested various tests and reprogramming but it did not correct the problem.  The unit was fifteen days past the 90 day warrantee so they wanted me to ship back the unit and charge me $144.00 to examine it.  I can't afford to pour any more money down that hole for ten hours of service.  Stay away from the refurbished unit and don't buy a new unit without an extended warrantee,1

1825,"Causes Windows blue screen of death. Despite the rave reviews for this product, I'm a bit more skeptical.  I recently purchased an HP LaserJet 3015 MFC and wanted to use this device to connect to our office network.  A couple of thoughts:1. Toms Networking does a comparison between this product and Silex's SLX SX1000U.  I would strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this product to read the article.  The article can be found at:[...]2. Although Silex's product only has one USB port, you *can* connect a USB hub to support up to 15 devices.  The KeySpan device supports 4 devices, but you cannot add more devices.3. I found that the unit would experience problems if I submitted a print job greater than 7 MB through the KeySpan.  I reset the printer and nothing got fixed.  Only when I power cycled the KeySpan did things work.  I am using the latest version, v1.3.1, which also upgrades the KeySpan firmware.4. Toms Hardware also reports that it would crash with several different devices.  I read on other web sites that the Keyspan software causes the blue-screen-of-death (IRQ_LESS_THAN_EQUAL errors), so I tend to believe that the problem is caused more by the Keyspan drivers than the HP ones.5. In some parts of its web site, KeySpan advertises that this unit supports USB v2.0, but if you read the fine print it's supporting at USB v1.1 speeds.6. I discussed with KeySpan about connecting external hard drives.  This unit is really meant for multi-function printers and cannot support external HD's.7. I decided to return this product and try out the Silex instead.  Although there is a lot of potential for this device, I would not suggest it for enterprise environments.  I read the glowing Amazon reviews but would put more skepticism about their comments now that I have tried it for myself.8. I will update this review later when I have a chance to try the Silex unit",1

1828,"Bad News. I have a 2006 Lexus GS300, and this item failed miserably.  The skip function did not work, and the unit randomly changed the tracks on the iPod without any user intervention.  And the mechanism itself made so much noise, that when the music was set at a lower volume, you could hear the cassette mechanism turning over the music.  Top that off, the sound quality provided by the unit was fair at best.Disaster",1
1829,"WARNING. I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore.

Called the customer service number on back of the unit to see what could be done if anything.  After the phone self-help proved useless (very user unfriendly), I struggled to get out of the ""loop"".  Finally, reached a voice who put me on hold, came back, and they transferred me to another technician where my call was dropped.

1836,"""Not Responding"". If you are one of those types who can become frustrated after fiddling with a portable mp3 player for an hour just to get 9 songs transferred to it you'd better pass this baby by. I often wonder if the people that make these things ever do any real testing, with real people, to see how functional their devices really are.The mp3 player itself played music fine. The real problem comes when you try to add or remove music.From the time I plugged it into my XPPro machine to the time I unplugged it with 9 songs on it 60 minutes had elapsed. Everytime you plug it into your machine you have to reinstall the driver. So you'd better have a special folder setup to hold that driver..you'll be needing it. The music manager is prone to lockups. Get ready to see a lot of ""Not Responding"", shutdowns and launching Task Manager to try and shut down the ""frozen"" music manager. You will find this will not shut it down though. You will have to unplug the USB cable from your computer to get it to shut down. But do not try and deactivate the USB device like you are supposed to before unplugging any USB device. The OS will not let you. You will get ""A program is accessing this device"" message. That program is your ""Not Responding"" music manager.When you add a song it puts the song where it wants to. You'd think a song that begins with ""A"" would come after the song that begins with ""B"" on the device but that's not the way it works. And there is no way to order the songs after you add them and they go in the wrong order. You try and drag it up or down and it locks up. And don't try renaming to get them to order that way. Because they will not rename properly. The music manager is a poor design.As far as the device itself. You'd think that in our high tech age they could come up with a fool proof connector. Think again. You'll need a magnifying glass to connect the USB cable to the device because it CAN go in the wrong way. And this is not the type of device you want for jogging or working out. They supply this long necklace for it to dangle from. But you start running down the street with this device hanging off your neck, whipping back and forth, and you'll be knocking out fellow joggers left and right! You'd think they could also design a pair of ear phones that actually fit in your ear! Just slow walking with this device shoved in my pocket I was frequently putting the ear bobs back in my ear. And don't even ask me what it was like to replace the battery on this power hungry gadget.I guess my 8 certifications in IT just don't qualify me to be skillful enough to use such a high tech device. Perhaps you will be more fortunate. But if you want my advice. Pass IRiver products by. The hardware may work but you need software to run it. And unless you like the message ""Not Responding"" try another product.",1

1842,"Barely - but barely - satisfactory. Graphics aren't bad, maps are fairly accurate and the same goes for the turn-by-turn instuctions. There are, however, a LOT of flies in the ointment:First and foremost - very week ability to detect satellites. The unit loses contact frequently and takes an inordinate amount of time to relocate them. The slightest hint of clouds make this process take even longer.Second, VERY puny CPU. It's calculations are excutiatingly slow. So if you try to get the unit to set a route that's longer than, say, 75 miles you may be done with a big chunk of the trip before the GPS actually completes the calculation. And, of course, once the original calculation is completed, your current position is no longer the position the calculation is based on, and the process of recalculation starts all over again... Very frustrating, unless you are on a relatively short trip.Third, it does have a built-in mp3 player but it might as well not have it. The sound is pretty bad. And if, heaven forbid, you try to play music while it's in the process of making ANY calculation whatsoever, the sound gets worse and the calculation gets much slower.All in all, it's better than no GPS but the price differential between this and the better units (I have an older Garmin StreetPilot unit with which I'm very happy) is not enough to justify the purchase",1
1843,"Nearly Worthless, save yourself the aggravation and just run a phone line. I purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom. Because of old wiring in the house, the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available. While I use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room, I needed a phone jack so my Tivo could dial out and get programming information. When set up, the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them. I purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that I could use it almost anywhere in my house. After a lot of effort, I find the unit to be nearly worthless.The range is VERY limited. I made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else (furniture, electronics, etc.) were in the way, yet there was no dial tone. I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to. I couldn't imagine using it with an electronic device (like a modem or Tivo) that sends data. I got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within 15 to 20 feet of each other. Needless to say, with that kind of configuration, it's easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard",1
1844,"Who really knows until it's too late... This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.",1

Trouble reading dvds, dvds skipping, discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units.  The price is right on the unit, but not for the time it worked.

The optical mouse works ok on this mouse pad but the laser mouse (micro) does not work at all.

1857,"Decent mount, bad design. I own the Explorist 500LE and bought this mount and the cigarette lighter adapter for the unit to use in my truck.  As noted in some of the other reviews the USB connector, which also provides power to the unit, has a ridiculous screw on method of attachment.  Understanding that it may be necessary to have a non standard USB type of connection for water tightness, there must be a better way to accomplish the connection.When you have the mount stuck to your winshield and try to connect the USB/external power cable it is nearly impossible to 1) get the power connector through the mounting bracket and properly aligned with the back of the Magellan and 2) be able to screw on connector that is rather tight between the back of the cradle and the mounting bracket arm that attaches to the windshield.  (The same screw type connector that is used on the back of the Magellan battery compartment.)  It apears that the USB connector is supposed to clip/snap into place onto the back of the bracket so you can remove the Magellan and leave the cord in place on the bracket.  I couldn't get it to hold or keep the connector.  Eventually the main tab that is supposed to hold the USB connector in place eventually just broke off.  I found it impossible to insert the Magellan into the cradle and connect it to the external power cord without removing it from the windshield.When I received the bracket, the head was loose on the end of the flexable arm.  I removed a few screws and tightened the head, which wasn't a big problem.  I found the bracket itself keeps the unit as steady as can be expected and does not droop or change position over time.  Whereever you move it to, it stays put.  I do like the side to side pivot design of the mount that allows me to turn it to face me when I need it and can be centered so the kids/wife can see it when I don't need to.If I was just using the mount to hold the unit and didn't plan on using the external power adapter, the mount would receive a 4 out of 5.  I'm a Professional Engineer and in my opinion, this system needs to be sent back to the drawing board for a new design.",1

It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day.Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.)The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash",1

After a half hour on the phone the operator I was dealing with said that I should have picked option 3 on the original voice menu (which a pretty confusing menu to begin with).

The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care.At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last",1

I end up not knowing if the destination (say McDonalds) doesn't exist nearby, or if I just spelled it wrong. Additionally when I pass up a turn I don't want to make, it goes into ""Recalculating..."". Then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as I'm driving through the intersection....""Recalculating..."" again. I think she does it on purpose.

1866,"HP 2360: Ripoff. This printer is a piece of junk. The print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges, the mechanism is likrly to be damaged. Like other HP printers operating under XP, it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem ( e.g. paper jam, paper out). Cancelling a print job results in a ""deleting document message"" which remains until printer is disconnected (you can turn it off under these circumstances) and computer is rebooted. Often XP hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering. I have long had this problem with an older HP model, but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now, but alas.... The crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge.

1890,"Short-lived machine--avoid this lemon. Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing ""the entire internal mechanism"" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.",1

1899,"Not good. Maybe you can make this thing work for your particular application, but it was pitiful for what I was trying to do.  First off, let me point out one thing.  If you're planning on using the little RF wires that hang in front of the InfraRed recievers on the front of your components, bear this in mind - when you stick those units in place, they block the receiver on the component from being able to receive an infrared signal.  When they are in place, you can only tell your components what you want them to do thru the RF signal.  That means you can't use the existing remote for any of your components, which of course means you have to trust that you'll be able to program every single function of those remotes into this unit.  I happen to have DirectTV with Tivo as well as a fairly complicated Denon A/V unit.  I cannot imagine trying to use this universal remote to control everything that the original remotes did and even if I thought the universal could do it, I wouldn't want to try to relearn all those functions on a new remote.  I'm used to the layout of the DirectTV unit and I'm not about to start over again.That being said, you can still use the RF functionality without the hard wired RF transmitters.  The MRF-100 will also receive the signal from the remote and transmit it wirelessly to your components.  The problem is, you have to position the MRF right in front of the components a few feet away - not real convenient unless you want the thing sitting in the middle of your living room.  If all your components are in a cabinet or something and the MRF is in there with them, that may work better, but if not you're out of luck.Now, all that aside, the remote will still not transmit to the MRF with any kind of consistency.  It also will barely transmit thru walls or any other solid objects.All I wanted was something to control volume and maybe channels from various locations around the house and on the back porch.  Without rendering my other remotes useless and/or requiring me to place the MRF in a ridiculous location, there was no chance of getting what I was after.  Nice idea, but no dice",1

I am not even kidding, they are probably the worst headphones in the world and the worst headphones i've had in my life...first of all, when you listen to music there is a loud hissssss noise in the backround, second, these don't even fit over your freakin ears...haha, also, they are tooo bulky, you can't do anything with them...the sound quality is ok...but if your looking for noise cancelling headphones, i dont recommend these, i recommend the sony fontopia headphones or the 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones that are ear buds and not too bulky (availible at brookstones)...now those are what you call great, these panasonic earfones are just horrible compared to these, it only takes out like a little of the noise, but the sony 120 dollar ones at brookstone takes out 70% OF THE NOISE! that's amazing, it is probably why they are so expensive...well i have to leave but this is my advice to you DON'T EVER EVER BUY THESE HEADPHONES IN YOUR LIFE!!! THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!hope this helped",1
1903,Too bulky. The remote is very thick. You need a side picture to see how thick this thing is. The buttons are not comfortable either,1
1904,"serious drop in quality. I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are ""user-friendly"".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture.First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap ""watered down"" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well.I bought a yellow ""psyc"" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all.I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them.",1
1905,"Beware, this does not work with all Tom Tom GPS products. I purchased this adaptor because the listing said it worked with all Tom Tom GPS navigators. To my surprise it did not fit my Tom Tom One GPS navigator and I ended up breaking the end of the adaptor trying to force it in.Look up the USB wall adaptor for the Tom Tom One and save the frustration of ordering the wrong adaptor",1
1906,"why can I not find good DVD storage. This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!",1
1907,"poor monitor cable. I purchased this cable as a replacement, and it is far worse than the original I had.  There is noticable &quot;shadow&quot; distortion. My advice is to buy a higher quality cable w/ ferriete beads. This cable was not useable",1
1908,"Not Portable. I bought this ""portable"" DVD player that bills itself as being the perfect solution for watching DVD's ""on-the-go.""  Unfortunately, as of the time I purchased it, the description fails to note that it must be plugged into a wall outlet or car power source.  Thus, it won't work on a plane, and if you use it in a car, you apparently have to run the cord up front to the power supply.  I think the name and description of this product is misleading.  The documentation states that you can buy a universal battery pack, but that would increase the cost substantially.To be fair, the return process for the third-party seller is going smoothly, and after a bit of resistance, they have also agreed to reimburse the shipping costs for this item",1
1909,"Subwoofer has no power (literally). I have been very disappointed by these speakers. I have the series III ones. While the treble sounds fine, perfectly clear...this system has NO BASS! My husband recently bought a $35 set of 2 computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds 10x better than mine!Because the subwoofer feeds power off the stereo/reciever it's hooked up to, and does NOT have its own direct power supply or amplifier, it literally lacks power. This subwoofer is the biggest joke ever! I can barely hear the bass on most things, even with the volume cranked up.Bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced. Do not waste your money -- buy something worthwhile (for a fraction of the price!), and make sure the subwoofer has its own amplifier/direct line to outlet",1
1910,"Device not worth the investment.... I did own this router for almost 5 months, Linksys WRT54GX2 v1. In the past, I did owned those routers for at least 6 months, Linksys BEFW11S4 v2 (4 stars), Netgear MR814 v2 (4 stars), D-Link 524 revC (3 stars), Linksys WRT54G v6 (5 stars).I've bought this router for couple reasons. I wanted to have a router with QoS feature and gives a good signal. It turned to be very disappointing (at least for Linksys WRT54GX2 v1), it never delivered a good connection speed. My wireless client 802.11g speed was around 32Mbps sometimes and I was only a wall away and 10 ft. from the router, not mentioning some dead spots. It felt as if you were connected through a dial up. I have changed ""Advanced Wireless Settings"", flashed to the latest firmware 1.01.18, changed to different channel but it did not solve the problem. The device will lockup after 5 or 6 hours of activity but not every time. The WAP feature used to reject any client after ""Group Key Renewal"" expired but it was fixed with firmware 1.01.18.I've contacted Linksys customer support and they told me the router was faulty. I am very suspicious because a lot of people had the same issue. I am not sure if it has something related with Linksys WRT54GX2 v1 (there is a v2).I haven't tried with SRX wireless client device but regardless the case, I think it should work with standard 802.11g client. Do not buy this device, not worth the investment. I've bought Linksys WRT54G v6 and it works much better than this one. I think it's a device where Linksys needs to work a lot before it becomes stable and usable",1
1911,"Not loud enough for a shop phone. I got one of these (the Sears Craftsman version) as a gift, so the price was right- otherwise I'd say it's overpriced.The maximum volume is much too low to be used in a noisy environment. The handset is thick, so if you hang it from your belt, (upside down because of how the belt clip is attached)then you're going to scrape it off and have it fall to the floor. The keypad numbers are sealed, but the buttons themselves are very small.If this is really a shop phone, then why isn't there some sort of bright flashing light that lets you know visually when a call is coming in? If you're wearing ear plugs, or running a noisy tool you'll never hear the ring.I haven't found the extra battery to be necessary or usefull. I think it's just a gimmick to appeal to the &quot;cordless tool&quot; crowd. I'm sure that the &quot;spare&quot; battery won't last any longer than the one you leave permanently attached to the phone.One supposed selling point for this phone is that you can put in a garage or shop where you have no phone line installed. You can do this because it comes with a transmitter/receiver unit that you can plug in anywhere in the house there's a phone jack. Don't try to use this phone very far from the trans./receiver unit because its range is pretty low.I'm giving this phone only one star because it has some useless features, is missing several other necessary features, costs too much for what you get, and doesn't perform very well, ESPECIALLY considering it's billed as a specialized shop phone",1
1912,"Buy some string and soup cans. Amazon forces you to put at least one star to review an item, but these phones don't even earn that.  Our 10-year old $18 kmart phones were wearing out, but are way better than these Unidens.  Hissing, crackling static, and the volume of the person on the other end suddenly changes, from ok to inaudible.  We tried various things suggested in the manual.  They didn't interfere with our wireless internet or anything, but we haven't been able to have a single conversation on these-- always end up at the old corded phone.  The ringer is piercing and annoying on the loud setting, and just annoying at the low volume setting (nothing in between).  At least with the string and soup cans, the bad volume is constant.  These are going back to the store",1
1913,"Doesn't work on Windows Vista!. Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista.  Got this message: ""One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.""  The mini-disk that came with it was no help.  No response from Tiger Direct.  Went to Radio Shack and got one.  It works",1
1914,"Does not fit Nuvi 350 or 360. Although marketed by Amazon to fit the Garmin Nuvi 350, it does not!  Wrong fitting.  I've decided to just charge my Nuvi from the car with the DC cable that came with it, the same way I frequently charge my cell phone",1
1915,"Disappointed. Although the graph link cable is excellent in principle, mine did not deliver as advertised.  My computer/calculator interface was sporadic--sometimes it worked properly, sometimes it did not.  Further, the CD-ROM that came with the cable was, in my opinion, of poor quality and was not user friendly; the help section was particularly disappointing.  Finally, I found the TI internet resources for the cable to be substandard as well, with customer support being particularly inadequate.  After visiting their site, I felt as though they needed some competition to help motivate product quality....  In conclusion, the TI grphics calculators are fantastic, but their accouterments need some improvement",1
1916,"Not worth the money or hassle. To be honest, I have always used and enjoyed reliable service from LinkSys networking products.  Until now, that is.  I purchased the WCG200 V2.0 unit to replace an obsolete Surfboard modem.Because the WCG200 is an all-in-one router/modem solution offering both wired and wireless connectivity, I thought this would be a great thing.  And it would be, except for one major technical issue.  It suffers from a connectivity issue resulting in extremely frequent modem disconnect/resets (often multiple resets within a single hour). And, while a major of the complaints posted in the forums on LinkSys's website are concerning this problem in the wireless operation, it also applies to wired operation as well (Coax and USB connections).IF the WCG200 Router/Modem worked as advertised, I would give it a ""5-Star"" rating, for it's easy setup and features.  However, given that this serious connectivity problem has been reported to LinkSys as early as March 2006 without any corrective measure or firmware fix being offered to the customer, I would rate this as ""-1 Star"" if given the option.",1
1917,"waste of money. i was using the tape player for my ipod.  but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter.  i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency.  i was very very disappointed.  it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease.  i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear.  so i blame the transmitter.  i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it.  i'm glad target took it back.",1
1918,"Same problem as others, sticks to glass...then won't stick. I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest ""advantage"" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a ""portable"" system",1
1919,"It is not really a mp3 player!!!. After buying this for almost one, I decide to write a review for this machine.FIRST, this is NOT a true mp3 player!!!I was convinced to buy this from amazon.com mainly by the long battery life promised by SONY, and high capacity of the 1GB Hi-MD. This turned out to be true after I tried the machine.However, the use of this machine is a painful process.I have quite some collection of mp3 and wma music albums,  and some mp3 audio books. At first, I thought I can just plug in this machince into my computer and transfer the files I need, and listen to the things I desire. In the end, I found, all of the mp3 or wma files must be first converted into SONY's special format(.omg) with the provided hassel software, then you can transfer and listen them. The conversion takes so much time, although the transfer of the converted files are pretty quick. In the end, I have to quit the using of this and replace it with a Creative MuVo TX FM 1 GB MP3 Player.This is not a true mp3 player!!!SONY's thought are very different from other mainstream mp3 companies!!",1
1920,"Flawed DVD Playback. Picture looked great via HDMI, but unfortunately there was a major problem during DVD movie playback. DVD movies would frequently stutter at chapter changes. This was a show stopper for me and I returned it.  Perhaps my issue was specific to my setup (HDMI), a defective unit, or something else.  However, I went and got the Panasonic single disk HDMI player (S52?) and all is well (except no 6 disc changer). Onkyo tech support was not much help either (They basically told me to return it). Save yourself the return shipping costs and buy the Panasonic player",1
1921,"It works as promised, but not worth the money. Being a huge fan of XM, I was excited when I saw this product.  Sure it looked bulky, but I wasn't going to be moving around much while I used it, and I was going to use it only outside.  The first unit I received worked fine, but the volume/FM frequency selector ""toggle"" snapped off within the first few hours, leaving me unable to adjust either.  This appeared to be a design flaw, and as such I promptly returned it without incident.  I did get a second one and am mindful of this toggle switch.  I do note that even with careful use, the headphones age very quickly, and I do not think they will last too long.  The bottom line is that the product works as advertised, but does so at great expense, bulk, and does not appear to be durable.  If you can get a much lower price, go for it!",1

1923,"Better off without mic. I married this mic to the Olympus WS-200S Digital Voice Recorder, which by the way plays in stereo. When attaching the mic there was a significant loss of volume, as the system only used one channel rather than stereo. The resulting loss of volume requiered the volume to be turned up during playback increasing backround noise levels. I use this device to record class lectures at the college level. Without the mic I was able to hear student questions from the back clearly. With the mic installed, I could no longer make out all the questions from the high volume related static.",1

It's comfortable, has most the shortcut's I'd want, however it's designed for Media Center, and Media Center only.  No IE/Internet shortcuts are present, which in my opinion is a bad design.  Everyone that has a Media Center PC, also has Windows XP ""professional"", which could use those short-cuts.My largest gripe about this product is the mouse.  Why Microsoft makes you press downward, in addition to the direction of the mouse is beyond me.

It literally took me about 9 miles out of my way to get to a local establishment.  Tried changing the preferences and it was worse.  Checked the manual, tried everything, if you put it on preferences for no toll roads/highways it takes you in circles down back roads till your dizzy.  If you program it on tolls/highways it will take you miles out of your way to locate a toll road and then back again.

After a two week wait the Technician arrived from a local TV repair center.   The Tech recommended that I take the TV back and exchange it for another.

July 31st 2005:I was looking for a DVD player for my bedroom at Costco and couldn't resist the $179 price for this brand new Philips HTS3400 (HTS3410 is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than silver/black).I played some DVDs and CDs and after 2 days i decided to return it for 2 reasons:1. It makes a hissing sound when it's turned off. Now, it wouldn't bother me too much in a basement (althought it would still be anoying), but it's a definite NO NO in the bedroom.2. Rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them.If you don't mind these 2 things, then by all means go for it.Aug 2005 UPDATE:Having nothing better to do, I went and purchased another unit from Costco to see if indeed I have a bad unit or it's a design/manufacturing issue.Surprise surprise...second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder!Curious enough (i'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics) i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from. It is the AC/DC transformer, more specific two 330uF capacitors making this noise.That is really poor design and/or low quality components!!! I did not expect this from a brand name like Philips. This is no different than any no name units out there at half price.As a result I am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product, this one is definately not worth the money. I cannot update the stars but this time I would rate it with 0 stars.Oct 2006 Update: It stopped reading CDs but it reads DVDs no problem. Returned to Costco!",1

Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).The armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband",1

By the way: they don't offer any kind of repair service on this product. Even if you're willing to pay (like me). If it breaks on you, you're on your own",1
1951,"ink costs more than the printer. I have an epson cx4600, which on the surface looks to be a bargain, at $80. But the ink costs $60 to replace (3 colors and black) and the black, which I use mostly, costs twice the color ink.But here's the real jab, I don't print too much and the ink got clogged some. It says to clean the print heads, and then print a test pattern. Well, the test pattern did not show completely clean, and so I repeated it 5 times. Then to my horror, I saw that each cleaning cleans ALL cartriges, and after the 5 cleanings, I was down to 50% ink. They don't have a way to clean just the black cartrige (or a specific color). I tried faking it out by saying i was replacing the ink in one cartrige (pull the black out and then back in) and it almost got the thing unclogged, but on the second try at this it got worse.Bottom line, they give away the printers then get you by selling you high priced ink. The size of the cartrige is miniscule and I think you could probably only get about 20-30 full page images printed for about $50-60 worth of ink",1
1952,"How could Microsoft screw this one up???. I currently use a Microsoft Intellimouse that I purchased about 4-5 years ago. It is the MOST COMFORTABLE mouse for medium to large sized hands. Bar none. Microsoft kept it sweet and simple and they had a winner! Why they ever took this mouse off the market, I'll never understand.After getting a new PC recently, I decided to ""splurge"" and get one of these ultra-ergonomic mice. I looked at the usual suspects: Logitech, Kensington, Microsoft, etc. I was disappointed as the feel and fit of the various mice I tried weren't as smooth as the Intellimouse. Then, lo and behold, I noticed that Microsoft rereleased the Intellimouse. Great, my search is over!I received the mouse today. Same design, same fit. Awesome.Only one problem you manufacturing geniuses,... the scroll wheel rattles unbelievably!!! How bad? Think of those old-fashioned New Year's Eve noisemakers that you hold by the small handle and twirl around in a circle. That's the sound it makes, I'm not kidding. The original Intellimouse scroll wheel is very quiet when in use.How could you screw this one up?! It's the same product you offered a few years ago with the color being black now! Did you somehow lose the drawings on the original Intellimouse scroll wheel? Did you need to save that extra 50 cents by having it manufactured somewhere else?What a dealbreaker. I'm sticking with my old Intellimouse until Microsoft gets a clue and fixes this oversight",1

1954,"Not as good as my camcorder's internal mic!. Perhaps this would work well in an area with alot of noise, such as a sports game, but I wouldn't recommend this for any other reason.  In fact, I returned this mic because it wasn't as good as my Panasonic GS180's internal stereo mic. I did identical tests with this mic, and with my camcorder's mic.The Atr55 did pick up better on voice clarity and depth when in close range, but it brought in too much outside/ambient noise, and the cable makes alot of noise!  It's hard not to rub against the cable with your fingers when it's mounted on a small camcorder.The Bottom Line: you may want to do research on a more expensive mic like the Rode Videomic, I hear it's great, yet haven't tried it yet.  I guess you get what you pay for",1
1955,XP Users Beware. I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website...  so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format. I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100% XP compatible and may mess up your system,1
1956,"high expectations from Netgear brand - not a great product. I am not going to write what this phone does and what it doesn't, you will read it from other reviews. I will explain what problems I had and you might  have with it. At least it might help you to troubleshoot the similar issues.First, it was easy to setup the phone, connect it to the router and phone line, register your skype name and make your first land line call. Quality is good. Then I placed a skype call to a friend and ..first problem: no audio, nobody hears anything. I tried to use another skype account on my computer to make calls to/from sph200d and ..no audio.  I looked at all settings on the device, support website and found nothing. I tried to connect to the admin webpage using provided on the CD documentation username and password admin and admin and couldn't connect(second problem). Well, I reset a base unit and still couldn't connect to the admin page. I searched online and God bless internet found that documentation on CD is old and current username/password is admin/password. And what even better reseting a base unit have helped with audio problems! Hooray! Now I can make good quality skype calls without need to go downstairs to my computer.The next and biggest problem I've experienced is no matter that automatic sign in option is turned on the phone(and the web page) is asking the password every time you sign off/sign in the skype. Turning phone off, reseting base/phone, using different skype id, etc did not help. I called support, waited 15 minutes and was told I need to register the product online first. Well it has sense, I did so and called again. 10 minutes later customer representative from Deli was ready to provide me with an excellent service. First, he said yes automatic sign in should work and my phone is not defective, and asked me to do all steps I did already, i.e. reseting, etc. No luck. Then he left to check about this issue and called me back to state that phone MUST ask for a password every time I sign in for a security reason! (what about remember username/password option there?). Nice lie to a customer to make him believe problem is solved.Note: if you turn the phone off - yes there is an option to turn it off, please press and hold red button - without signing off, then when you turn the phone on it wouldn't ask you for a password. Right, but all this time that phone is off, friends see your status as online/away and may try to call you.Well, there is a solution I've found for myself - never sign off, just change your status to offline. I have not decided yet whether to return/replace the unit or keep it. Maybe when you learn tricks on how to use a device it would serve you well. But at current price/quality I would not recommend it, too bad there is not many alternatives.Good luck with it",1
1957,Broke very easily. The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy,1
1958,"Terrible Navigation Functions. I liked my Honda factory navigation, so I bought the Pioneer AVIC-N2 for my BMW.  Since I could not found a demonstration unit, I bought it based on reviews and thought most of the navigation system will be similar.  Now that it is installed, I quickly realized that it is a terrible navigation system.  The AVIC-N2 does not allow the driver to change the destination or use majority of the navigation functions while the car is moving.  Now I can NOT map to new locations, redirect to new routes while in traffic, find restaurants, locate point of interests in the area, and many other normal navigation functions unless I PARK the car first.  I called the Pioneer customer service and found them to be very non-responsive. The representative insisted that it is a ""safety"" feature.  In summary, I would not recommend this unit to anyone.  It is not much different from Yahoo Map.",1

1960,"Very Unreliable Product. The setup instructions for this product are totally inadequate as is the online troubleshooting help. With phone support, I was able to get the product working, but after a few days the H1000 lost communication with the extender. After two hours of undocumented procedures with technical support, it was working again. After two more days the problem reoccured. The fix seems to be to reload the firmware and software in both the remote and the wireless extender. If it fails again and it is too late to get a refund, I will throw it in the trash and go back to IR communication on my H1000.",1
1961,"Same problems as all of the above users. My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support. Guess what H-K, I won't be buying any of your products in the future. This is a replacement for a Sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years. And, I may take HK to small claims court if the replacement doesn't work.",1
1962,"Successfully burned 3 cds out of a spindle of 50. This is the second time I've been dumb enough to buy these- both times, I saw an uncluttered surface (no loud logos!) and the sony brand name, and assumed it'd be good quality. Only after my burning software failed again & again, and then my cd drive stopped recognizing any discs at all until rebooting, did I realize that I'd been through this before- with Sony discs, a year ago.I can't imagine what could possibly make these so bad. I've used just about every other kind of discs with no problem. Reading the other reviews here makes me realize it's not just me. It's pretty upsetting that I've wasted $40 or so on these things, for a grand total of maybe 5-10 usable discs",1
1963,"Not worth the hassle; not worth the $. Initially this unit seemed to work pretty well. I wasn't thrilled aboutthe copyright protection issues or the extremely slow time to load, but I decided to try to work with it. In six months, this player often arbitrarily decides not to record sometimes, and it often stops recording regular TV programming (my wife's favorite soap) due to ""copyright issues"" - completely ridiculous!Now this unit will not output any audio signals at all. Stay away from this piece of garbage. I used to respect Sony quality - I will never buy from them again",1
1964,"Slow, slow and SLOW!. Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform",1

1968,"Starry Eyed Over This One, But Lets Me Down. Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes.As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing.Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough",1

Strangely, the Uno was not using M-Audio drivers even though the hardware wizard looked like it figured everything out correctly. I checked Device Manager to see if the drivers were installed correctly (they were not). To get into Device Manager:1. I right-clicked on My Computer, then clicked on Properties2. Clicked on the Hardware tab3. Clicked on the Device Manager button4. Clicked on the plus (+) sign next to Sound, video and game controllers.5.

Just click ""Continue Anyway.""11.  If all goes right your ""USB Audio Device"" will change to ""M-Audio USB Uno Driver"" or ""Audio USB Uno MIDI Driver"" or both.Yes, I got it to work, but for M-Audio to have me go through these steps is unconscionable. The drivers should install without fuss. This is not a true ""Plug and Play"" device... not even a ""Plug and Pray"" device. It's just stupid. Giving 2 stars is generous. For those who gave 4 or 5 stars... maybe you have a Mac... or maybe you just live right, but this is not a great product. Even though it now works, there are some latency problems (press a piano key... hear the sound a couple of miliseconds later), and it sounds a bit muddy.

I can say this much: so far, so good.The Cons:Like others have stated already, the sound is good, but not great and they don't get very loud (the bass is virtually nonexistant too). The coord is long, but it's also incredibly flimsy for a set that's supposed to be high quality.The Pros:I gave these a 4 star rating simply because, so far, they're durable, they're affordable, and (despite what I've read) quite comfortable -- in my opinion. I've spent hours and hours spinning records with these on and I haven't had any discomfort (I should mention that I have small ears). Despite the heavy mileage I've already put on them, again, I may not be the best judge because I've only had them for 9 days. The package also contains a few cool skullcandy stickers, an adapter for stereos/mixers and the like, a nice looking travel bag that has room for more than just the headphones, and a pair of black ear cushions if you don't like the camo.My personal opinion as a DJ:While these aren't the worst headphones out there, you should probably go for something better if you have the cash. I swear by the Senheisser brand, but those and other high end brands can get a little expensive depending on the quality level you want. I think Skullcandy spent more time on the cosmetic aspect instead of focusing on performance, but I'd easily recommend these to beginners or those that want a more affordable, above average set of headphones.We'll see if I can say that they're durable 6 months from now though. I'll update this review if they turn out to be crappy, but so far they aren't.Update: March 12, 2007 Like most of these reviews have stated, these things don't last. I went to turn my set on and they just gave out on me -- I haven't had them for more than a month (it'll be a month on the 14th). I haven't dropped them or yanked the cord or anything of that nature, yet my headphones have failed on me. For that very reason, I reduce my rating from 4 to 1 star. These things are terrible",1
1998,"I wish I could pick zero stars for this piece of junk!!. Unfortunately, when I bought this thing it was new on the market, so the horror stories that are seemingly abundant now weren't around to warn me off back then. Needless to say, I have been plagued by problems with my pmc-120 from quite early on. My pmc has since totally died and despite testing with new batteries etc, turns on but does not respond.... Rubbish!! considering I paid $300+ this is unacceptable.To add insult to injury, iriver North America has not responded to my emails. Therefore, the warranty I paid for is effectively useless.Please don't buy this product.

2010,"re: Absolutely terrible. To celebrate the anniversary of our company, we thought we'd give all employees a gift.  Our Apple phobic IT guys nixed the Ipod as a choice, despite the CEO and CTO both owning and recommending them, so we went with the Zune.  Of the 50 we bought, 16 had to be exchanged for quality issues.  We've had issues with the drivers on the Vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the XP machines.  Several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones.We can't use them as data drives so they're not as useful as we'd like.  Finally, store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why DRM is applied to files if you share them.  Which reminds me, the wireless is half baked; too slow and we've had plenty of hang ups while trying to share.The end of the story is that the CEO is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle.  He has already said in no uncertain terms that when Apple ships a video ipod, the company will give those to make up for the Zune experience",1

I wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working.  The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap.  The touchscreen is very tedious to customize (I write software for a living, and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen).  I can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit, given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote.  The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen.  Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications, do not buy this unit.  Aside from the touchscreen's fagility, is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small, given the size of the remote.

I bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new HP dv2000 laptop, with internal bluetooth, I was excited about the Instant View feature and the lazer percision, however when I got the mouse connected it worked, but no instant viewer?  Turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the DONGLE pluged in... but... the reason I bought a ""BLUETOOTH"" mouse was in order to AVOID a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop.On top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are AWKWERD to press, I have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them, nothing like my old microsoft mouses' cozy side button.The middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three... which is set to activate the ""Amazing"" instant viewer, which is decent, but useless without the dongle.As far as lazer percision, not too noticable, my Kingston RF lazer mouse seemed to preform better.The only reason I gave it a 2/5 is the charger is nice, the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish, which feels nice and cool against the palm.This makes a DECENT desktop mouse, if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice.

2028,"Great printer but unreliable. I bought this printer after my HP 2100TN started needing us to press the button on the printer every time we queued a print job. At first the 3052 seemed the answer to our needs. It was very easy to set up for our home office and kids machines. It printed and copied fast and sharp. That lasted for about 100 pages and then it started producing a huge white area down the middle of the page. Removing and shaking the cartridge would fix this for a a few pages and then that stopped working. Faced with a long and frustrating time on the phone with support I decided to just get a new cartridge. This did the trick for about 200 pages and then it started missing the whole center section of the page again. Shaking the cartridge fixes it temporarily. Of course, it always does it when we are in a panic with a customer proposal or homework due that day. I am using genuine HP cartridges which are $55 each. My advice is to look at the competition.

2032,"What was apple thinking?. At first I was excited about the mighty mouse. The scroll ball worked very well, freely scrolling in any direction. The side squeeze buttons were a bad idea, because they could activate by holding the mouse too tight, but they can be disabled easily. But the mighty mouse has a much more serious and annoying design problem....The scroll ball gets dirty, and there is no way to open the mouse and clean it! The scroll ball collects dirt over time just like the trackball in older mouse. But thanks to the brilliant engineers at apple, their is no way to open and clean the inside of the mouse without potentially braking it. After a while you will loose scroll functionality and have no reasonable way of fixing it. Within three months of use, I could scroll down but not up. The apple support people instructed me to clean it by repeatedly wiping the top of the mouse with a cloth. This only sort of cleaned it, the inside of the mouse was still dirty. The scroll ball only works on and off with this method, so cleaning it this way is clearly BS.I'm still struggling to understand apple's reasoning with making a mouse that you cannot open. Apple has made trackball mice for years, and each one let you open it to clean the inside when the ball got dirty. This is an essential feature. I don't understand why apple thinks a scroll ball on top of the mouse would not need to be periodically cleaned exactly the same way.If you are buying a new computer from apple, I suggest getting a regular two-button optical mouse to go with it",1
2033,"Design both very good and very bad. I wanted this product to work very badly.  It has an elegant, simple design, and finally a transmitter that makes use of the radio's RDS function.  It also is simple looking enough to discourage theft, since it appears to be a simple charger.The bad is very bad.  First, the sound quality was very bad in the northern California area.  This is both in dense and thinly populated areas.  There always seemed to be interference whenever there was a break in the music.  Second, the plug kept popping out of the cigarette lighter.  I've used other car adapters, and they always feel secure.  This plug was poorly designed.  I would be listening to great tunes when pop, I am interupted by loud, unpleasant static.I gave this 2 stars as opposed to zero, because there is a chance that the plug will work in your car and a chance that there will not be static in your area.

2039,"Not up to belkin's usual quality. I have used several Belkin KVM products (Omniport and Omniport SE) and was very happy with those units over many years. When I wanted a KVM to use with my new DVI video I thought this would be a good choice. Sadly it is close to a disaster on three levels:SETUP / ERGONOMICSSetting up the unit was hard because my Dell DVI video cable housing just barely fit into the input connector on the Belkin base unit. The Belkin cables are quite nice, but have the smallest ""footprint"" of any cables I've seen and many cables that come with comuters or LCD displays will have a hard time fitting this unit. The compact neature of the KVM means that connections are hard to see if you do not have a VERY well lit area.RELIABILITY:Next, the unit worked for one week and died. My first call to tech support was offensive as the Belkin rep wanted me to replace my USB keyboard to be sure that was not my problem. Since I did not have one, I could not get any return authorization. I did finally borrow a keyboard the next day, but when calling belkin again, the tech did not have me test the keyboard at all. His debugging was simple and in 5 minutes he verified that I had a defective KVM.I got a new unit quickly and returned the old one (but see more on this below). That unit worked for 10 days and then began to malfunction. So far, I have been able to restore it, but this is only possible by powering down all the peripherals, unplugging all the cables into the KVM, powering down the KVM and reversing the process.CUSTOMER SERVICE:To get your RMA # for defective equipment you have to provide Belkin with a charge card that they say they will only use if you fail to return the defective unit. I was careful enough to have my unit shipped with delivery confirmation because Belkin charged my account (for a tidy $234+, way more than the Amazon price). When I called customer service I was told they had no record of receiving my return. But when I gave them the tracking number of my shipment, the rep immediately said, ""OK, that is all the documentation that we need, I will credit your account"". She was so matter of fact that I believe this is a common occurence.SUMMARY:Some Belkin products are great - this in NOT one of them. Belkin service is inconsistent and this issue on returns is one that makes me plan on avoiding Belkin electronic components. I am going to look at the IOGear KVM sold by Amazon as a possible alternative",1

This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad's new tracheostomy.

We've tried everything including taping the hole, but it then goes from 'all' to 'nothing' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through. Of course it wasn't until we started mentioning it to the various RN's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem.  So... I've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad's mask.

2054,"Once you put it on, you better leave it there!. To echo one of the other reviewers, exact placement of the wrist rest is near impossible.  Two days after I thought I had done it perfectly, a bubble appeared.  I tried pressing it out, but within a matter of hours the bubble back.  So, I decided to remove the wrist rest. To my disgust, the adhesive had (in the space of a few days!) begin to cling tighter to my laptop than the pad.  It took me about hour to get the last of the gummy adhesive off.Avoid the wrist rest",1

2056,Piece of crap. Like most of the other people who bought this piece of junk it quit working after a few months. You put a disk in and there is a loud noise and a bunch of colors jumping across the screen and everything is frozen. I will be throwing it in the trash and buying a reputable brand,1
2057,"Great picture but that's about it. I purchased this card because I have on another computer the AIW9700 Pro. The 9700 Pro card has been a great card and I thought the 650 would be also. Well, the TV picture is great once you get the card working. The catalyst software to record programs is worthless. I cannot get it to connect with Titan. Tech support is also worthless. I have been using the Gemstar software from the 9700 Pro to see what TV guide programs are playing. I can record programs while I am at the computer but there is no VCR type functionality to record while I am away. I am extremely disappointed with ATI/AMD that they would sell a product that does not work fully and at the same time not support it properly. I hope they are not naive enough to think they will get repeat business with this kind of customer service",1
2058,"Decent phone - power outage also took out base unit. The material and ergonomics of this phone is average.  The selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line.  Below are the factors that I considered before purchasing and my experience:Range:  The range of the phone is very good.  I can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop.Call Quality:  Average.  I have a Plantronics CS50 wireless headset that is on the 900 Mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit.  The call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear.  When I have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset, or vice-versa, callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call.  The Uniden is much more muffled and less clear.  It is however comparable to most cordless phone.  Not exceptional, but not bad.Durability:  Average.  I have dropped my handsets on rare occasions, they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well.  One of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor, which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn't scratch the hardwood floor.Special Note:  I suffered a power outage during a major windstorm.  The base unit will not boot up.  This appears to have happened to other reviewers.  This problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house.  On this issue, I have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars",1
2059,"Compatibility Issues. Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for",1
2060,"Don't buy this remote.... I will make this review very simple.  No matter what features you find attractive about this remote, its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable.  Unless you have large hands, you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it. (make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it)In terms of features, the remote has only the simplest of ""learning"" features.  If you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn't have a code for.... good luck",1
2061,"A WARNING - DO NOT USE. I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
2062,"I was hoping for more... While I have always followed the age-old adage of ""You Get What You Pay For,"" I have to say that I was hoping for more, even in this price range. While I am no stranger to assembling furniture such as this, my cabinet had several pieces that just didn't quite line up and, consequently, caused me to re-drill a few holes.Additionally, while the black veneer is of the quality that one would expect in this range, it was already separating from one of the corners after only a week of ownership. Nothing a little wood glue didn't fix, but it's still a disappointment.Lastly, the cabinet is very wide but has a very shallow depth, causing it to be fairly unbalanced if you aren't careful about where you place your media. I initially loaded the cabinet at the top and left the bottom empty. It tipped over forward, spilling the contents and creating quite a mess. I shudder to think of the consequences if it had fallen on a child or a pet..",1
2063,"Not Very Durable. Will need battery changes. I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS",1
2064,"Problems Problems Problems. This is a great idea: a small CD player to match the rest of the Tivoli line. Unfortunately, the quality of the units I tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the Tivoli line. All in all, Tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems: one wouldn't play the disc, one wouldn't eject the disc, one had an LED readout that would go blank, and one had variations on all of these problems. The Model One is a great product and the PAL and the others are close behind, but the Model CD needs a lot more work",1
2065,"Wouldn't work on my computer. The hook up and downloading the software was very simple.  There was a error problem with the drivers.  My computer is fairly new with windows xp.

2066,"Not a fan of these defective fans. These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.",1
2067,"Weightlifters beware..... I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons.  First, I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt.  That wasn't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve.  But then I went to wear it for a run, and the arm-band was too small for my arm!  I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training, but nothing outrageous.  I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users.  This is unfortunately not the case.  So if you have larger than average biceps (say 17"" amd up), save your money...",1

I needed a new headset to use with Ventrillo, online voice chat for gaming, and I needed two requirements: 1. must go through the USB port because my mic port is broken, and 2. must be wireless because I constantly trip over the wire on my Logitech headset when making quick trips from the computer to the kitchen... which is why my Logitech headset broke in the first place.This Microsoft headset fits both requirements, so I bought it. Unfortunately, the sound quality is HORRIBLE. It sounds like you are talking over the phone, like someone calling in to a radio show. It is NOT crystal-clear sound at all. My guild mates on Ventrillo laughed at me so much that I put this headset aside and slapped my Logitech headset together with masking tape",1
2070,"Bad design.....flimsy toggles.......JUNK. Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3.

Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very ""tiny"" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.",1

2072,"Good Player with Bad Battery Life!!!. I bough this product after reading several reviews from other people .Pros : Toshiba Gigabeat is really nice from the design perspective , the look and feel is pleasant. The software is well designed and pretty intutive . Though it doesn't have the click wheel like iPod , but I didnt find any problem using it and going through the various menus. They are all well designed and are visually much more better than the i-pod or other similar players. It takes some time to get use to the buttons and other controls , but once you get accustomed then its a zip .Cons : I returned this player after one week , because the biggest killer to it is the battery life, it hardly lasts for 6 hours. You cant expect a mp3 player to last just 6 hour. If I am outta my house , I should be able to play it for at least 12 hours...thats the only problem which i find with this, which undid all its goodness.Overall a good player , if you can live with a short battery life",1

The first unit received had a loud hum in the audio and HDMI from my new Sony player through this unit created an extreme blue cast on the video.  I returned the unit and another was sent to me.  This unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using HDMI from the Sony DVD player.  It was not the DVD player because when I hooked the HDMI from the DVD player directly to my TV everything was perfect.  I am very disappointed in this unit.  As for Amazon, they have been great in responding to my problems, getting a replacement unit to me and then refunding my purchase.  I give Amazon 5 stars",1

If you are a fan of AMD and use their processors (hence a likely nForce chipset), stay away from this product, because IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT!Aside from having to install a separate USB card to get it to work (which I cannot do for my laptop) it has performed quite well.  I read many reviews about the audio quality, and I tend to agree.  The audio will clip if I turn my PC volume up over the halfway mark.

To switch from computer input to TV input requires one push of the Source button...... but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes - as the TV cycles thru AV, S-Video, Component modes, and finally back to PC mode.  A weak design - the unit should recognize which input is enabled - it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes.This is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a TV/PC monitor.Picture quality is acceptable for the application, which is primarily watching news channels while working at PC, or displaying dual PC applications",1

One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click.

Don't bother with tech support. They'll tell you to clean the corona wire and drum, which I did a million times to no avail. Eventually I gave up, went out and purchased another cartridge, and voil, problem solved -- for another couple of months anyway.

The inside of the channel has ledges in it to hold the screws in place.   These ledges catch on cables which the user adds or removes after the unit is mounted.  I gave up on trying to remove an RCA cable from the unit and just cut the darned thing, rather than trying to feed it through the channel.I wish I could recommend a better wall-mounted cable management unit.

2107,"Extremely disappointing after having used the real EB. Being an enthusiast of the EB, and already owning a softwareversion and an old paper edition, I was very thrilled by thepossibility of having access to the EB on my pda as well. Nomore would I be left musing about a strange place nameon a book read in the cafe, or wondering what the currency ofa country might be called... It was a disappointment, then,to find that the ""Concise"" in the name of the product is aneuphemism for grossly abbreviated; many articles do little morethan state the obvious about their topic. Moreover, one wonderswhy this needs to be the case, as current SD cards have becomecheap and have enough capacity to contain a lot more text. Isit the desperate need for claiming 900 ""illustrations""",1

2109,"Not reliable. The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though:- The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time & shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa.- The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA & MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none.- The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often & I would need to reset it at critical junctions.- The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models.- The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range.I returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months. It was great on part of Amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy (although they deducted 20% restocking fee).",1

Catch-22.Not usable for me as I don't use the Administrator account except for special purposes, a security ""best practice"". Without the Turtle Beach specific driver it works as a generic USB sound card with the default Microsoft driver(no reinstallation required!).

This means you have to remove your DVD or music CD and put in this special disc.  You then have to be in park to put your DVD back in and start it again (we have screens on the headrests).The worst part is you can't use any features of the Nav system while you are driving!  I have to pull over to enter an address or find a point of interest.  While my husband drove, I figured I'd be able to use these functions.It is not user friendly.

FM reception is poor, sound is terrible, controls are not intuitive.  To top it all off a year after purchase (yep, the warrantee just expired) the CD player decided to only play the first track of any CD inserted.  Forget listening to the rest of it.

2123,"Thanks to AMAZON!  No thanks to COBY. This player has garnered decent reviews, so I thought I'd try it.  The first unit sent to me was unusable because of skipping.  I had purchased the extended warranty -- but Amazon's extended warranty defers to COBY's warranty for the first year, so you have to deal with COBY directly.  I found that one could hardly ever get through to Coby, and when I did, they had to consult and call me back, so I ended up having to try to get through three different times, only to be told I'd have to PAY TO SHIP THE BAD UNIT BACK TO THEM -- which would cost almost as much as the unit.  THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON.  When I called to express my discontent, the Amazon customer relations staffer quicly and easily sent me another unit.  THANK YOU.  Because the second one works without skipping.  It sounds okay, it does the basics.  There is no ""resume play"" function, however, which is annoying.",1
2124,"Great idea, but lacks follow-through. The GPS works great!  Having said that, I'm disappointed with the 5919 overall.  I could not get the free map updates from TomTom because HP does not include the Navigator 6 product code with the 5915.  HP's support promised they'd get the maps and post them for 5915 users, but that hasn't happened after several months of promises.  The wireless worked only with non-encrypted networks, and even then, only for 1 day.  I have to perform a soft-reset at least three times a day because the system hangs.  MP3s play fine.  It will play video, albeit they are very choppy.  USB connections to the computer seem to work only after loading the very latest MS ActiveSync, and only after a soft-reset.  Even then, having the computer recognize the device is very ""iffy"".The unit is a great idea if you travel--maps, email, Internet, music, contacts, appointments, etc., but if it doesn't work, it becomes a paperweight.  I've read dozens of forums with others complaining of the same issues.  HP support so far has been nothing but lip service.  My recommendation--don't fall for the marketing hype, this unit still has to have a lot of bugs worked out",1

2126,"Save Up -- You can do much better. The previous comments about these headphones being ""distance-sounding"" are right on the mark.  They have very little soundstage, and the mid-range sounded muddy to me.  Bass is decent, and they have treble, but do yourself a big favor.  Save up some more money and go for the Sennheiser HD-555's.  For about $150 you'll be getting a killer set of cans with great soundstage.  If you get a chance to A/B the difference between the HD-485's and HD-555's you will not be able to buy the 485's.  The HD-555 are very close in sound to Sennheiser's primo HD-595's, but cost $100 less than the 595's.  Go for the real value of the HD-555's.  If your really in a pinch for cans, I think the open-ear Koss KTX Titanium phones (for about $20 bucks) make a much nicer sound than the HD-485's. Comfort of the HD-485's is also a big issue.  They aren't nearly as comfortable for long wearing sessions as the Sennheiser 500-series headphones or the Koss.  In summary, the HD-485 is a mediocre headphone even at this price range.",1
2127,"Hoping for the best. I bought this Cobra 2500 watt inverter to upgrade my existing 1500 watt inverter in our travel trailer. It arrived quickly and in about a week I was installing it. This turned out to be quite a hassle, because the Cobra uses two positive and two negative power input lead cables. My old inverter used one of each. I had to buy all new cables to hook it to my batteries. Once that was done, I switched it on. So far, so good. I plugged my 'circuit checker' into it and got an ""open neutral"" reading. Hmmmm, not good. However, it did seem to operate all my on-board stuff properly (though showing an ""open neutral at every plug in the coach).However, in short order, the unit gave out. Boom - no power. I checked to be sure there was no break in the incoming power, and checked for power at the plugs on the unit. Nothing. I called Cobra customer support and the gentleman asked about all the tests I'd done (and I'd already done all he would have asked me to do). He said the only thing he could suggest now was to mail it to them and their 'techs' would put it on the bench and determine what was wrong.So I shipped it off the next day - and that's where we stand now - waiting to hear what's wrong with it, or get a new one to replace it.

I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along.

2131,"Unreliable, and AWFUL support. The printer worked well for a while, then after about a month, simply spat out two sequential pages of blank paper each time we tried to print with it.HP technical support was extremely poor. I had to sit through an hour of a fellow called Raj saying ""will you please be pressing"" this button or that button, ""will you please be turning off the printer and turning it on again"", and trying out a whole series of inane tests that I told the tech support person I'd already tried to no avail. Finally we were told to return the printer - which should not have taken an hour! - and the support guy said ""please be sending all your printer's accessories and new ink cartridges with the printer please"". So we did (including brand-new ink cartridges, the duplexer, and the rear paper feeder, as Raj instructed) and after a few days, received the *same* printer back - minus the duplexing unit, the rear paper feeder, and the ink cartridges! It took a lot of cajoling with HP ""support"" to have the duplexer replaced, and the rear paper feed unit was never replaced at all - they claim to have lost it. Then after a week the printer started malfunctioning again in the exact same way. No-one in the company can afford to spend the time for Raj or his friends to put us through a long series of tests, give us misleading information, send us an incomplete unit, following which we will waste more time engaging in frustrated diplomacy sorting out the mess HP will make. It's just not worth it.Good technical support pays for itself about five-fold in customer satisfaction and referrals. The standard of HP support was so abysmal that I cannot recommend this printer",1

You have to convert all your mp3's into TRAC format before the player is able to play them. You also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your HD....this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online. Another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has. Just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds, imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take.

Sometimes after selecting ""play movie"" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen.Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say ""Bad Disc"" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing.

We were excited about the prospect of peer to peer positioning, etc.  After 10 minutes, one of them locked up, then the second one would not transmit only receive a radio communication.  The only way to get either one of them to function properly again was to remove the power source, wait a few seconds and reinstall and power up again. The first time this happened I was hoping it would be an isolated incident; then it happened again 10 minutes later.  I checked the software; one was running ver 5.40 and the other 5.20.  Webupdater would not work with one of them.  It would lock up during the firmware upgrade.I chose to immediately return the items, thinking that if it is this much trouble now, what will it be like later. I expected better quality than this from Garmin.  Great features and an intuitive user interface are a plus; however, dependability in the long run is apparently non-existent.

Usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and don't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people.  These Westinghouse intercoms (and I believe the same goes for the NOVI intercoms) require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit (that is, controlled by the same electrical breaker).  So, if your kitchen, family room, master bedroom, and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system, the Westinghouse system will not work for you.Intercoms are usually for large houses...large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets...hence, this product likely will not work for most people.

But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player",1

2162,"Chintzy design...very misleading pictures. Based on the pictures shown on Amazon as well as Logitech's web site, one would believe the dropping your iPod into the dock charges and provides the audio connection to the speakeres.  You'd be incorrect on both counts.  You still have to plug into the computer to charge this thing, and there's a cable (not shown in any of the pictures) that you have to plug into the top of your iPod to make the audio connection.We returned this item and went with something by Altec Lansing in the same price range instead...we're much happier with it",1
2163,"Return policy. We wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom.  The reason I give two stars is because of Beach Camera's return policy.

I have been very unhappy with this product. The other two cards are not PNY.  This card seems to work fine in the camera and palm pilot, but will not work when I plug it into the SD slot in either of our laptops.  It just locks up the computers for a while then asks if the card should be formated.  Clicking ""yes"" or ""no"" does not help.  I get a message that it cannot be formated.  I am sure it is the card since the same thing happens on different computers.  Like another reviewer, I, unfortunately, threw the packaging away because it appeared to work in the camera.  I even tried to have the camera format it.  It just can't be read by the computers.  None of the other cards have this problem.  I can't return it and it certainly isn't working properly.  I would recommend buying a different brand",1
2165,"sadly- it's been relegated to the junk drawer. I'm not a system analyst, so I need really clear instructions for any new device. I bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which I could view from the Internet at my office.Troubles I encountered:1.) Set up was impossible. I finally figured out that I had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free Internet connection. I wasn't willing to do this.2.) I could view from the Internet within my home network, but not from my office.3.) Had to convince one of my company's IT system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera's system. Took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure-- which worked until I had to reset my router. 2 weeks of use in one year.4.) I have never been able to have the camera send ""snap shots"" to my e-mail or ftp folder. D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly... but the feature doesn't work. I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my Internet security program. No can do.5.) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked!6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid &lt; $80 for an indoor camera.Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work. For the couple weeks it was viewable on the Internet it provided a nice view of my home, but it wasn't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation.",1

Everything Garmin makes is proprietary so that nothing else will work on a Garmin. You will be unable to transfer data to Garmin media, you will be insulted by a website either written by or for aliens and should you call the customer service or cartography lines assuming you wish to wait and wait, you will get to talk to people so uninformed about Garmin products your wait was wasted. The dingus works ok with Garmin chips, but the chips are inadequate or incomplete.If you should have a Mac, Garmin leaves you totally unsupported so that if you choose a Garmin you need to buy a PC, a downloader, and Garmin chips to go with Garmin's vastly overpriced CDs. In short, if you prefer unsupported products that are designed to force you to buy from a company indifferent to their customers, Garmin should be at the top of your list with their GPSMAP 276c",1
2167,"I should have listened to the bad reviews. I read the bad reviews of the RV042 and ordered it anyway figuring that a company like linksys/cisco would fix such glaring problems quickly, bad assumption.  As a software quality assurance engineer I'm pretty tech-saavy but after two days of wrestling with the QuickVPN, I could still not get it to work.  The problem is one of documentation, their information on troubleshooting the QuickVPN is not helpful at all which is too bad because otherwise the product appeared first rate.  The web configuration interface is very intuitive and easy to use, I was able to get the basic router/firewall working with my custom firewall rules in a few minutes.If you do go ahead and buy the RV042, I would suggest that you plan on hiring someone who has used the RV042 before to configure it for you.The firmware version of my RV042 was 1.3.7.10 and the version of my QuickVPN client was 1.0.39.  By the way, when you review products like this it is very helpful to readers to include the version numbers so they can see if the problem may have been fixed",1

2181,"2 or more handsets are a problem. I agree with others that this phone has great sound and range.  However there are two design flaws that I'd like to point out.1. If you have more than two hand sets on one base and two or more people in your house and the phone rings there could be a problem.  If two people pick up handsets to answer at the same time ONLY ONE will actually be connected to the incoming call.  The loser will get an error tone and not hear any of the conversation.  So, if the incoming call is not for the ""winner"" how does he tell the other person the call is for her?  Which handset do you transfer the call to?  You do not know which handset she picked up.  With old hardwired extension phones you simply determined who the caller wanted and the other party hung up.  Now so easy with this phone!2. The keypad lock feature actually increases the chances of a child dialing random digits to call 911 by accident!  Yes, when locked the keypad only allows dialing 911.  It does this by rejecting all digits EXCEPT 9,1,1.  So if the keypad is locked and a kid dials 4592171 and eventually hits the green ""pick up phone"" button it will call 911.  Any random string of digits with digits 9,1 and 1 in it will look like 911 to this phone!However, if you live alone and have no small children this phone is great.",1

She looked up the answer, and read off a statement:""I apologize for the inconvenience of your lamp burning out sir, but the lamp unit is not be covered under our service plan, as that is an accessory which requires scheduled replacement.""It also seems like this is not a warranty extension, as it starts the moment you purchase the plan, not the moment the manufacturer's standard warranty ends.My first job after high school was in an electronics store, selling TVs, stereos, and appliances, as well as the extended warranties that are offered at those types of places. Sometimes they are worth it, if they replace a common unit which tends to fail on a normal basis.

It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity).

It took over an hour (I don't know exactly how long since I had to leave before it finished).When I got back, I decided to do a test copy of the data back to the Cruzer.  The same data only took 10 minutes to download back to my 1 GB Cruzer.It seems clear that ""Hi Speed"" for Lexar means USB 1.0 (about 12 Mbps) and not USB 2.0 (about 480 Mbps).I'm sure the marketing department said ""Why confuse the poor stupid consumers with technichal specs.?""I searched their website to see if there was more information but the suits seem to have veto power over the web designers as well.If speed is important to you (and with a 4 GB drive it is logical to assume that you are going to have some large files to move) then steer clear of this product.  1 GB of data will take you on the order of an hour or more to move.Of course if speed is not important or if you only have 1.0 USB ports on your machine then the product is fine.

2208,"Flawed Device. I purchased the Garmin Forerunner 201 from Amazon, believing I was buying a reliable piece of gear. It doesn't work properly in any built up area, i.e. city, where most of us live, or areas with too many trees, i.e. where we city dwellers like to go when we leave the city. Basically it leaves stretches of your running route out, but the stop watch carries on ticking. So if you're like me, and take satisfaction in turning out fast-paced runs (or what passes for fast-paced for us amateurs), the 201 will only be a source of frustration. It'll time your run perfectly, just like any stop-watch (duh!), but then leave out some of the distance you ran, so that you get a mile for mile average that yo-yos in a very suspicious way. Particularly when you've put out a steady effort. And it'll miss out bits of your course in different places on a day-by-day basis. You'll find yourself ""adapting"" the info the device gives you: how's that for precision? The interval training feature is even worst. You dial in some mile repeats, with a timed interval, and set off at full blast. The minutes tick by and the mile never ends! That's when you find that there are gaps in the ""mile"" you're running, and you're killing yourself when you've actually done the mile, and should be in your rest period. I kid you not, I wouldn't dare sell a GPS device that works 70% of the time and I'm not speaking of heavily built up areas, I run in spaces where the closest buildings are at least 60-90 feet away...But this is not the worst of it. I though I was getting a well made piece of equipment. I live in Brazil, so I bought it off Amazon, and a friend kindly brought it over for me from the US. In less than 1 year, it started turning on/off by itself, in a crazy dysfunctional way, rendering it totally unusable. Currently it doesn't stay on for more than 1 minute at a time. It now runs it's battery flat by itself. Even though I'd been scrupulously careful w/ it, not taking it out in the rain, and drying off the moisture & sweat after every run religiously. Some of you may say I should have used the warranty, but when you have mailing costs Brazil-US, and if the thing's fixed or replaced, 100% customs duty when it gets sent back here, you'd give up, just as I did. I'm not paying twice for a piece of gear that never worked properly in the first place.My conclusion: try some other model, or even brand. I'd not lay my hard-earned cash on this gizmo again",1
2209,"Starting to go after two years.............. I never had a problem with this radio until today. It has been exactly two years since I bought the delphi boom box. My display unit on the CD part of the boom box has gone kaput. The radio still works, but I cannot see what radio station I have on and I cannot see the song number on the CDs. I called delphi tech support and was told that since I am passed my one-year warranty, I am out of luck. They can do nothing for me. They told me it would be cheaper to buy a new one because to fix it would probably cost me about $80 an hour. I can probably live without the display unit, but I hope this doesn't mean that more things with this radio will start to go wrong. Be prepared to possibly have to upgrade after two years with this one.",1

With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more",1

The cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire. You could even use household scissors to gnaw through.Having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer. However, if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer, you might as well get something with a stronger cable",1

Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times",1

After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang).

But, whatever.However, the software is crap.  That's the appropriate term.  Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time.  No you can't make the template show right-side up.  That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS.  I'm not kidding!  I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side.  You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should.  But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again.  So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways.

Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product.

When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced",1

The stomper software is pretty lousy for bringing in artwork created outside the program, but I got that down after two mis-registered prints. SO I THOUGHT I was finally in the clear- until this cheap backing and paper started ripping in the print feed. How hard does Avery have to work to make a decent product. Jut to be clear- the original stomper paper that came in the pack worked fine through the same printer. So I can only assume the problem is this product.

How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews...

If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and ""hope"" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here.

Echo the other reviewers regarding the sliding contacts, they barely work correctly right out of the package, consistently getting disconnected at the slightest bump. My bet is that after a year of use they don't work at all. And after a disconnect, you start the 8 hour cycle all over again. Which brings me to my second complaint.The charger works on a timer, something that is not specified on the outside of the package. This is the worst way to charge your batteries, cooking them with a full charge even if they don't need it. Get a charger that senses voltage and your expensive batteries will last a lot longer.Another thing, this charger will charge only an even number of AA/AAA batteries, something else that is not specified on the outside of the package. It has four separate charging circuits, each circuit will work only if it has two identical batteries in it (C, D, and 9 volt can be charged individually). Again, this is a very bad way to charge your batteries, especially if the two batteries have different discharge levels.And finally, the quality is very very poor. One charging circuit on my unit didn't work right out of the package. It kept showing that it had bad batteries in it, even though there were none.",1

HDMI 1.3a, 1080p, firmware upgrade over Ethernet, etc. The unit seems to be solid (heavy) and well built.However, Toshiba chose to ship this HD-DVD player with only a composite A/V cable (yellow, red, white RCA jacks) in the box. The best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i, and not even as good as an S-Video connection for that!It is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and HDMI 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set (component video or HDMI) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an HDTV. I don't know how much cost savings Toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $5.Now let's get to the real review:Pros:- One of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular DVDs to 1080p. The upscaling is very high quality. The unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered DVDs.- If the weight of the unit is any indication, build quality is high.- It has an Ethernet port for firmware updates (and possible future functionality)Cons:- Very slow boot time. Takes longer to boot than my Windows XP PC.- Especially durimg 1080P HD-DVD playback, the unit gets very hot. Make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back. There is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player.- This player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic DVDs, so you have to use your TVs scaling function. Kind of  a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers",1

This product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments I bought for mp3 player/audio system. Its sound reproducing/transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality. It does not balance well the low/high frequency sounds, resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity. Mine worked ok for the first several hours I assume.

2266,"Creative ZEN Nano 'minus'. The Creative Nano sucks. 4 hrs and 2 calls to tech suppoert and the unit still will not be recognized by my computer. One of the Tech support help points was to use one of the USB ports on the BACK of the computer rather than the front (not in the instructions). They say that the ports on the back of computers are more capable that those on the front (?). I asked them why they would design a device - with a 6 inch cable - that required you to crawl under your desk to plug it in each time, when there is a perfectly good port (that works for every other plug-in device I have) on the front? All I got was a sheepish, 'yeah, I know' from the techie. Still did not work on the rear port. Then they wanted me to go in and do some monkey work with the computer's register. Forget it. It goes back. It's like buying a radio for your car and then being told you need to work on the transmission to get the radio to turn on. What a piece of crap.  Amazon should have an option to rate '0 stars'",1

2276,"So close and yet so far!!!. Sure, this calculator does lots of really neat stuff. It would be impossible to give a rating based on the features. Either it does what YOU need it to do, or it doesn't, like any other tool.However, I can rate subjectively, and this thing is subjecting my head to a ROYAL headache!! The LCD viewing angle has been designed so that you only get good contrast when viewing it at a very weird angle - exactly the WRONG angle if you are in a room with overhead lighting or brightly colored walls. In order to get good contrast you must be looking at the LCD screen at such an angle as to make the LCD screen and the curvy faceplate reflect overhead lights, the ceiling, the walls, etc.  If you attempt to view the LCD screen head-on in an attempt to reduce these inevitable reflected light sources, and so that the characters on the screen are not stretched due to exaggerated perspective, or so that the buttons actually face your torso so they can be easily pushed (god forbid) the characters appear extremely (!!) dim. That is, the ""contrast"" is set all wrong, and I haven't found any way to fix it (a technology that was mature for hand-helds in the 1980s).Now, if there is a way to fix the LCD contrast and I'm just ignorant about it, I'll gladly take the egg on the face to fix it and get rid of my headache. But I doubt it.Then there's the hard cover. Like so many other calculators these days, it comes with a nasty hard plastic cover that increases the thickness by 30%, and also increases the width a bit. And of course to go without the hard cover leaves you with nothing at all for protection. The soft cover some other calculators come with is thinner, lighter, and takes less PLASTIC to construct. But as we see all too often in thousands of OTHER made-in-China products, the more plastic you can get the consumer to buy and carry around, the ""better""...or something.So, just like most calculators, the hard plastic cover 'works' but sucks and should be a separately purchasable option. And this perverted LCD viewing angle is almost prohibitively uncomfortable and the inability to adjust is beyond asinine.These are SUCH EASY THINGS TO FIX - it's ridiculous that Sharp would put so much excellent functionality into such a miss-the-mark package. Where's QA on this?!?Made in China",1

Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness.Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress.

I have an HP G85 OfficeJet multi-function printer and the setup did not work at all. The tech support was useless. They kept trying to ask me what brand of computers I had on the network and what my ISP was. None of this mattered except to the marketing department. It drove me nuts. After 5 phone calls I finally got hold of a technical support person that confirmed my printer was not compatible.Separately, even if you have a compatible printer you should be aware of a serious bug in the software if you use 128 bit WEP security for your wireless network like we do. Unless your network uses key 1 (of 4) you cannot hook the print server into your wireless network. There are radio buttons to support the other keys but they do not work.

It was expensive, but I was impressed with the overall design and quality of the product.  I've had that mouse for more than a year now and haven't had any problems, even with heavy use.When I heard Razer was branching out into PC audio, I was naturally curious.  So I decided to pick up a pair of these headphones, along with their AC-1 sound card.  Again, they were expensive but I felt I would makeup for that in design and quality.When I first opened the box I found that the cord was melted together in a few places, like the wire insulator hadn't cooled properly before it was rapped together with the plastic twisty.  I also found that if I pulled these bonds apart, they revealed the bare wire.  Not good.  So I sent it back, and got a replacement.  When I opened the second pair I found the same thing, in addition to one of the fancy LED lights not working.  Luckily, I was able to pull the various bonds apart without revealing any bare wire.  The light still doesn't work though.I am, to say the least, disappointed with Razer here.  I have since read other reviews about people complaining about similar issues relating to the quality of the headphones.  (screws coming loose, volume control loosing responsiveness, etc.)  Gamers in particular tend to use headphones hard and don't appreciate when they ""break"" before their time.

2324,"Not Quite There Yet. I purchased this yoke thinking that I would get a better flight experience with MSFS but the responsivness of the yoke is terrible.  I had an older version from several years ago and it had the same problems.  I was hoping that they had improved their product, but it is basically the same yoke that they had 10 years ago with a couple of extra buttons aded.  They need to develop a better slide mechanism so that there is a smooth transition when climbing or decending.  There is way too much friction between the stick and the collar of the housing.  You often need to overcompensate with a sudden push to overcome the friction which makes the plane hard to control.  It is very hard to get the yoke to center so you are always having to make adjustments beyond what you can do with elevator trim.  But this is pretty much the only reasonably priced yoke on the market, so I wouldnt hold my breath on them revising the design to make this into a quality product. I would not recommend this yoke for anyone wishing to get a true flying experience.  I wish Saitek would make a yoke with the same quality that they put into their rudder pedals, but for some reason they have stayed out of the yoke market",1
2325,"Poor audio output and no mic mute make Big Al mad!. I want a wireless headset for Skype and maybe some gaming. I thought the ZX-6000 was it, but it's not. Not even close!First, the sound can get really bottom out. Sometimes my Skype friends sound like gurgly lagoon monsters, hungry and ready to feed. I can't hear the mid or high ranges of their voices. And the connection seems unstable, causing pops and drop-outs. So I take it back, lagoon monsters may be more coherent. Initially I thought this was a Skype problem but I plugged in my wired headset and I could hear them clearly.I like the headset design, but it doesn't feel comfortable on my ear. I imagine if my grandma took out her dentures and sucked on my ear I could get the same sensation. It's OK for a few minutes, but after that, I can't take it anymore....wearing the headset, that is.Volume levels are fine and the volume buttons work, as does the power button. The call button, on the other hand, is an anomoly. It does nothing unless you use voice on Windows Live Messenger. And even then, you have to install software. The button doesn't work for Skype or Yahoo. But what annoys me the most is that button would serve much better as a microphone mute button. This headset does not have a mic mute! Volume and mic mute controls are essetial on any headset! How could you not have mic mute!So those are my big gripes. A few other things that annoy me:1) The USB receiver is large considering the dongles that come with mice and other peripherals are pretty small nowadays. It also has a cord, which is good if you want to set the receiver on your desk, but I prefer just a small USB dongle that plugs directly into my PC. I bought a wireless headset to...forego wires, not take one off the headset and add it to the receiver.2) It would be nice if the headset was Bluetooth so I could use it with my cellphone. As it stands, it just works with PCs. I know, I'm probably asking too much seeing how Microsoft overlooked some of the more basic elements like a MIC MUTE!I want to use a wireless headset, but there's not much to like about this one. I regret purchasing this headset. I just hope my $[...] rebate comes through to soften the blow",1

2343,"No tape monitor feature. It has been 15 years since I last shopped for a stereo receiver, and back then there were certain features that all receivers came with, regardless of how basic or inexpensive the model was.  Well, I took for granted that they all still came with these basic features, and I was wrong.  I just purchased the Sherwood RX-4105, and it does not have the tape monitoring feature.  It has tape input and output jacks, but it doesn't have the monitoring feature that lets you listen to the tape deck's output while you are recording.  If you press the tape button, the receiver switches away from the input source you are trying to record from!  The tape monitor function is also necessary for the use of an equalizer.  It baffles me that they are still giving you tape in and out jacks, but don't give you the proper switching for monitoring.  I guess they figured they could save a few pennies by leaving out this function, since the demand for tape decks has declined in recent years.  Unfortunately, there are those of us who still like to use an EQ to customize the sound to our environment, even if we are no longer recording on tape.  I have found it difficult to verify whether or not a receiver has this function, since the specs and features list usually never mentions it.  If they have a good picture of the unit, you can look to see if there is a button that says ""tape monitor.""  Just looking for tape in and out jacks will not help, because as I mentioned above, the RX-4105 has these jacks, but no monitor function.  Then there are some models that have monitoring even though the switch only says ""tape.""  The best way to know for sure is to try out the unit first, but this is not practical when shopping online.  I have even gone so far as to go to the manufacturer's website and download the instruction manual.  If the section on tape connections and recording doesn't mention ""monitoring,"" it probably doesn't have it.  Also, many models no longer have phono input, but this is easy to check just by looking at a good picture of the unit.  The RX-4105 also lacks an auxillary AC jack on the back of the unit; not a big deal, but a consideration if you have an outlet strip already filled up by other components. Another thing I noted that is worth mentioning is that many newer models such as this one have volume control knobs that do not have any position indicators or scale markings on them; so be sure to turn down the volume before you turn off the unit, or you could be in for a surprise when you turn it back on again!If you don't intend to use an EQ, and don't need phono input, the RX-4105 is probably a good inexpensive starter model.  The sound seemed fine, and it had plenty of power for my application.  The tuner did seem to have a weak sensitivity; some local FM stations came in with a lot of static.In my research I have found the TEAC models RV-S2100 and AG-790, as well as Onkyo models TX-8011 and TX-8211 all have tape monitoring capabilities as well as phono input.",1

2346,"READ IF YOU CAN'T TURN ON YOUR NEW PLAYER. When you receive your new Zen Vision M, there is a very good chance that the player can neither be turned on nor be charged. If it CANNOT BE EVEN TURNED on, all other pros and cons of the unit are irrelevant. So I will spare all such details in my review.In my case, it took me TWO replacements and a lot of headache to finally figure this out. Here's the issue: if your new player's battery is completely drained - which is often the case due to inventory sitting in some warehouse for a long time, then you're in for a world of pain! The player is not shipped with a wall charger. So out of box, the only way to charge the player is to connect to your PC and charge it via the USB. Here comes the rub, in order for the charging logic in the embedded code to activate, the player needs to be turned on and recognized by your computer's USB controller! But if your battery is completely drained, you cannot get it turned on. I think you can appreciate the chicken and egg problem here. The ONLY way to get around this nightmarish problem is to find a wall charger. Luckily, I found an old PDA charger with similar power output/polarity/connector to get the thing going. My advice for you is to look around your house, chances are you can find an old cellphone/CD player/PDS AC adapter that plugs into the DC input of the sync adapter. But for most people, the only option is to bite the bullet and pay extra for a wall charger.I think it's as low as a company can go to exclude the accessory that's ESSENTIAL for the basic operations of the product. Even worse, no where on Amazon, on Creative's website, and in any of the included documentations, is this documented. Very lame. I'm not a lawyer, but I think a scheme this lame warrants a class action law suit (Mr. Ambulance Chaser, please contact regarding this proposition:).Once you do get the thing to turn on. Then you're all good. You can charge it using the USB for the future (unless your battery is completely drained again, in which case you will have to go back to a wall charger of some sort).I knew I said I wasn't gonna go into all the pros and cons. But I must say something about the sync adapter. The thing is ridiculous! The larger-than-iPod form factor allows all such connections to be built in. There is really no logical reason for this kind of ugliness. Why? Very ugly engineering. Perhaps Creative will decide to exclude the sync adapter  AND the wall charger in the future.",1

Unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs (which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs) you get really good at it.

2359,"PCI Gigabit cards aren't going to be Gigabit speed on the PCI bus. The PCI bus does not have the bandwidth to get you Gigabit speed.  You will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a PCI gigabit card, even with jumbo frames.Your motherboard has two PCI busses, and sometimes has three.  Depending on the chipset and the manufacturer, the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy, internal network, USB, Firewire, and more, will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses.  You will have to run SiSoft Sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the PCI bandwidth it can get, but that will not be close to gigabit speed, either.  Best case on 33 MHz PCI is 300 megabit.Even if you can find which PCI bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it, the 33 MHz PCI busses in all consumer PCs cannot handle the bandwidth of this (or any) gigabit card, anyway.  If you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 MHz PCI, PCI-X (not PCI Express), 64-bit PCI, or similar, but you're going to pay lots of money for that.Worse yet that built-in Gigabit interface might still be on a 33 MHz PCI bus and always sharing bandwith, giving you less than 300 megabit speed.

This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen.

2407,"Not cost-effective. In the case of HD Radio, the HD does not stand for high-definition, but hybrid-digital. HD Radio implements something called digital IBOC, which has only 60% the coverage of regular analog radio, poor signal penetration into structures, and causes adjacent-channel interference. When an HD receiver goes out of range of the digital IBOC signal, there may be a delay, as it switches back and forth to analog. HD Radio has extra HD channels, which evidentually, are just extra low-bitrate streams of repetitive terrestrial radio. Save your money and get Satellite Radio, Wi-Fi Radio, or iRadio (iRadio will be appearing in Rokr E2 cellular phones), which have hundreds of stations HD Radio just carries local stations. Wi-Max, or wide-area wireless access, will bring Internet Radio to portable devices, including automobile radios, by 2008. Sirius has just come out with the Stiletto, which receives Internet Radio via Wi-Fi hotspots, as Wi-Max will eventually allow for reception everywhere. Cingular and Sprint Wireless have 50 radio channels, available through their cellular phones, for a small fee. As a matter of fact, over 200 XM Satellite Radio and HD Radio stations are free on AOL Radio, so there is no need to buy expensive HD Radio receivers.",1

2410,"Poor sound quality. I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good.I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string ""telephone"" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly.The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly.I returned the receiver and both kits the next day.",1
2411,"Poor framerate, tricky setup. I really wanted to like this gadget, but I've ultimately been disappointed.  The idea is COOL, being able to see your family and carry on a FREE Internet phone conversation with them, and the price is much less than other videophone solutions out there.  Alas, there are a few problems still to be worked out with this device.Here's the saga of trying to just get the device to work with my network setup.  I tried calling Dlink (the i2eye manufacturer), Linksys (for my router setup), Comcast (broadband connection) and SunRocket (VOIP) for support on this issue.  I eventually got the device to work connecting to my parents' wireless version of the i2eye (which I setup through a USR wireless broadband router by opening the required ports) by connecting my i2eye (the wired ethernet version) directly to my cable modem (without my Linksys broadband router or SunRocket VOIP box in the equation).  I then tested various configurations until I was able to determine that the Linksys router (model WRTGS) was not forwarding ports correctly (I HAD properly configured port forwarding).  Linksys tech support tried but failed to help me out.  I swapped routers with my girlfriend who had a Dlink router and the problem went away (after also configuring port forwarding).  Would have been nice if Dlink could have told me when I called them for support that my router wasn't compatible with their device (though it's possible that my Linksys router has a ""broken"" port forwarding feature).  I also had to forward ports through my VOIP box which the SunRocket tech support people quickly told me how to do.  So I eventually got the damn thing working after a month and a half of trying.  Of course that is two weeks after the standard return policy of ANTonline expires (who I bought the device from through Amazon).Now to performance.  Even when the i2eye is connected directly to my broadband cable modem my framerate never rises above 5 frames per second.  That's both for the transmitted and received data stream.  (On my parents' end I have to connect wirelessly through their wireless router as their TV is too far from their cable modem.)  I've tried tweaking the ""speed"" settings on the i2eye to adjust the amount of data the device is configured to send and receive, but I never got an improvement.  Dlink advertises that you can get up to 30 frames per second using a high quality broadband connection (like mine and my parents').  I haven't tested my broadband connection's total upload and download speed because I simply don't know how (probably need some third party utility program).  Regardless I SHOULD be getting at least 500kbps upload speed and at least 1Mbps download speed (at both mine and my parent's end) as that is typical of cable broadband connections.  Also the image quality from the i2eye's ""lens"" and CCD is horrendous.  The brightness, contrast and general overall ""sharpness"" of the image is lousy.  That's simply not acceptable.  You can get better framerates (along with much better image quality) from a good webcam using one of the ""messenger"" applications out there.  Which is what I'm going to explore doing next.I'm going to attempt to return the devices now (both mine and my parents' i2eye) through ANTonline and Amazon with the argument that the i2eye devices don't perform as advertised and that I'm ""late"" returning them because of the difficulty in testing the devices (you have to coordinate with the people at the other end of the connection to determine if your own configuration is working).  I'll try to post an update to this review with the results of that attempt.Unless they can improve framerate throughput through some kind of data compression technology upgrade, I can't recommend this device to anyone.  Less critical improvements would be a better quality camera (and microphone) onboard and better support for setting up the devices (a dedicated i2eye server you can connect to test your i2eye configuration settings) including a list of supported and non-supported routers.Hope this helps someone else avoid the headaches and hassles I've been subjected to by this device.Andre",1
2412,"Save Your Money!  This System is Complete Junk!. How much can I emphasize that I wish we HAD NEVER PURCHASED THIS SYSTEM?  Purchasing a radio from a dollar store would be a better investment.  This unit is the result of poor manufacturing and will provide you with poor performance.  I'd give it no stars if that were an option.We have had our new Bose system hooked up for about two months.  One major complaint is the lack of a headphone jack.  I have never heard of a stereo system without a headphone jack.  We were updating all of our components and purchased a new Sony DVD Recorder/VHS and a new DirecTV DVR with Tivo.  We were trying to pair down our equipment.  Turns out, none of these components have a headphone jack.  All of these newer components are being produced without headphone jacks, which left us in quite a pickle.  Fortunately, we found a company called ""Ramsey Electronics"" which provides a headphone amplifier with audio cables to allow us to hook our headphones through the Ramsey unit and then into the Bose unit.  It set us back $80.Next, we had the dilemma with the remote.  The Tivo remote won't work with Bose, though it did work with my 12 year old Pioneer sound system.  Then, I spent another $100 on a decent learning remote that could control all of my components, but I'd rather use the Tivo remote.As irritating as that was, the most irritating thing about the Bose unit is that the audio/video plugs do not stay plugged in.  They are all kind of ""loose.""  We bought new, expensive A/V cables, thinking that would solve the problem.  We've tried everything to remedy this problem, including pushing the unit up against the back wall of our entertainment center in order to keep the plugs from falling out.  I can't tell you how disheartening it is to be in the middle of a movie with a $1300 Bose sound system and just have the sound go OUT because one of the plugs fell out of its socket.  It's not a tension issue, either.  It's poor manufacturing.Even more flawed is the DVD disc tray.  First, there is NO eject button on the remote, then when you press the eject button on the unit, it will just say ""Opening..."" Nothing happens!  Then, when you press it again, it just says ""Closing...""  Nothing happens.  My husband had to ""teach"" me that if you push the eject button in rapid succession, you can sometimes get it to open.  That's just swell for a $1300 investment.  I have a DVD player in the guest room that I paid $29.99 for and it opens and closes its disc tray, no problem.  Go figure.  Fortunately, for us, we have the Sony DVD Recorder/Player and use it when the Bose is being ""temperamental.""  We've only been able to successfully watch 3 DVDs using the Bose because the tray won't open.Also, it sounds NOTHING like it does in the store.  I don't know if they have some special demo disc or what, but our 12 year old Pioneer system had far superior sound.  We've never owned a Bose unit before and thought we were stepping up to purchase this one.  I think we stepped way down.  Also, how can a company that manufactures headphones-not make any units with a headphone jack?  That makes no sense, at all.  To inform me in the literature that I will ""lose sound quality"" by plugging my Bose headphones into a ""non-Bose"" component must be some sort of joke.  The Bose units don't have a headphone jack, what else am I supposed to plug them into?I am confused about this.  I've always been told that Bose is the leader in sound components, but this headphone issue is just a lack of good common sense and the shotty manufacturing of the plugs and disc tray have caused me an enormous amount of stress and regret.Save yourself money, time, regret, and stress by finding a different system.  This one will only test your sanity in regards to the $1300 you spent on this piece of junk",1

Using the cable DVR fast-forward button cycles the ADS through screen formats with each button push, etc.  I contacted ADS tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time.Obviously, this is not acceptable.Too bad because this box does a much better job than my Philips Cineos at upscaling.

2419,"DANGER, WILL ROBINSON!! NOT COMPATIBLE with Linksys Wireless PCI Adapter!. Okay ... it's late, and I'm crabby after wrestling with a wireless network for most of the day.I bought this bad boy to strengthen the signal for my network. A few really insanity-making points...FIRST, as several other reviewers have pointed out, apparently you can hook this thing up to your router. Not that the directions tell you that, though. The directions only show connecting to a free-standing PC. (How silly of me to think I could follow the directions.)I popped over to my local MicroCenter and bought a Linksys PCI card and this HSB2. (I'll usually try and stay with the same brand but MicroCenter had neither a Linksys signal booster or a Hawking PCI Adapter ... if indeed either company makes such a beastie.)I got home from the store, slapped the Linksys PCI Adapter in, fired up the computer and went to connect the HSB2. Things were going too smoothly. As soon as I unscrewed the antenna from the PCI Adapter the signal disappeared (which is to be expected). I then connected the HSB2 ... and still nothing. Rebooted. Still nothing.Checked Hawking's website. No user forums ... no nothing.Checked amazon, thinking that I might get some good tech advice. The reviews say you can put it on the router (what a concept!). I unscrew the antenna on the router (a Linksys WRT54GS) only to discover ... that the HSB2 connector doesn't fit. Argh.I call the tech support # from the back of the manual. Wrong #. Search the web, find the right #. I call and after a fairly short wait (a pleasant surprise!) I get a guy from India (no surprise there). I can usually understand these guys, but the connection was horrific ... had to start phonetically spelling everything like a WWII fighter pilot (""Kilo ... Bravo ... Whiskey ... Foxtrot..."").Anyway, the tech support guy right away starts talking me through the ROUTER end of things. I told him that I was following the directions (I'm goofy that way) and trying to connect to a PCI card. After a short stint on hold, Mr. Tekkie informs me that the HSB2 is incompatible with the Linksys PCI Adapter (this despite the HSB2 package that says, ""Also works with other certified wireless network adapters and devices with removable antennas."") Except that it doesn't.So.....Mr. Tekkie THEN suggests I try to hook up the HSB2 to the ROUTER end of things, at which point I inform him that the connectors are incompatible. Another short moment on hold, and he comes back and tells me that I need a HACST coupler to connect the HSB2 to the Linksys Router. ""Will the HSB2 be compatible with the router even though it's not compatible with the PCI adapter?"" I ask. Tekkie assures me that it will be.Amazon lists a HACST coupler at about $9.00 USD....can't wait to see what my local MicroCenter hammers me for it. (For installing my network I at least had the wisdom to buy locally so I could return things easier. When I go and pick up the HACST, it'll be trip #4 for the network....)I might return the HSB2 or I might pick up the HACST ...

I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.

2428,"I've had problems too. I set up a wireless network with the Belkin wireless N router and three computers containing the desktop card. The first two worked fine, although they've been lightly used. They're both within 10 feet of the router. The third computer (unfortunately my main desktop) is located about 30 feet away on the same floor down an open hallway. It's hard to know exactly what's going on because the computer freezes periodically with the desktop card installed. When it doesn't lock up, it has video problems and switches into some God-awful default mode. All three computers are running Windows XP, but my computer is the only one to have these problems. During the brief intervals when I'm actually able to bring up the Belkin wireless networking utility, it either shows the wireless network with minimal signal or the wireless network doesn't show up at all. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, updated drivers, and everything I can think of to no avail. I also have a laptop running the PC card N1 adapter. It works OK but the signal varies between good and poor, again in the same room 30 feet away from the router. Needless to say, this has been a discouraging experience and has soured my impression of Belkin as well as 802.11n. Unfortunately, as I've read reviews of competing products, they all seem just as bad. I think I'm going to break down and run a wire to my bedroom and drop the wireless desktop effort for now",1
2429,"""Acquiring Signal"" for eternity. I purchased this receiver in December 2005. It worked like a champ until February 2006 when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal.The unit works for five minutes from cold start up, then the audio cuts out. Display still shows program info. Being an experienced PC user, I turned the unit off and back on, repeatedly. The message ""Acquiring Signal"" displays permanently, even though the Antenna Aiming screen shows full SAT and TER signal bars.My best guess is that a ROM or RAM chip cooked. This unit runs hot! JVC has been less than helpful. It sucks to have to landfill  a $100 piece of hardware, but no one will touch it. It's my last purchase from JVC.Glad I didn't purchase the Sirius ""lifetime"" license",1
2430,"Nice features but poor display and reception. A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out.It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird.Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes",1
2431,"Did not perform as advertised. This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that",1
2432,No Vista Compatibility. Do not buy this if you are planning on using Windows Vista.  There are no (not even beta) drivers and the Windows XP/64 drivers do not work.

2433,"Review. The adapter, which allows you to connect your CD player to your car's stereo system, worked fine and I am completely satisfied with it.  The CD player is a different story.  It repeatedly would not recognize disks (that worked fine on a different player), or would read a disk for a while but then stop, just generally very poor reliability.  I didn't return it, as the adapter was what I needed the most and I had another CD player that worked fine.  My advice is to buy the adapter by itself and then get a different CD player",1
2434,"NEEDS HIGH CONTRAST DISPLAY!!!. I'm sure the capabilities are wonderful. That's why I bought it.

I couldn't program it without getting a headache from eye strain.If it had a decent display, it would be great. Without reasonable input and output display, it is just a piece of junk",1

The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC.I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it.Very disappointing",1

2437,"DWL-G820 is a piece of crap. Do not buy this for your xbox.  It sucks.  The unit was functional (well, not defective) and by 'dialing in' to the unit it was able to communicate (with and w/o wires) with my computer.  The first red flag was when the xbox did not recognize the DWL-G820 as a wireless adapter.  This is normal.  It has to be configured with an IP address, which is ridiculous because the wired router connection is normally plug and play.  However, no amount of configuration in the xbox dashboard would allow the xbox to connect wirelessly.  This was even with the assistance of tech support, which is spotty at best.  The folks are nice enough, but getting through can take a very long time.  I'm okay with networks - all of my other stuff works great - but definitely not an expert, and I could go on and on about the changes I made.  I won't, though.  If you prefer painless set-up it's probably best to match brands when designing a wireless network.  I'll give D-link the benefit of the doubt and admit I was using a router of a different brand, but with all of the configuration options on both ends, this should not matter.  Oh, and I read some of the earlier reviews and I agree that this thing runs real hot.  Who knows what that'll do for the product's longevity because I don't plan to keep it.  If I ever got it to function properly and I had small children, then I'd probably mount it out of their reach",1
2438,"Drive itself is great, U3 software troublesome. As a sysadmin, I am administering Windows, Linux and Mac PCs all day, and need this device to go between them all seamlessly.Pros: lots of room for data, after much headache, I uninstalled U3 and the drive now works on all platformsCons: The U3 caused trouble from the start.  Confuses linux machines (I wasn't expecting U3 to work, of course, but it is supposed to appear just like a data drive on non-Windows PCs - instead, it just failed), failed to work on a Mac, failed to work on VMware Windows images, failed to work on Windows PCs where the PC has some policies that prevent full access to the PC (i.e. most work/corporate environments).  Other cons are that it doesn't fit well onto my keychain.  It comes with an extremely flimsy cord to attach it to things - so flimsy it was immediately obvious that it would break on a keychain with the way keys get used throughout the day.  So, I ditched the cord and fished the keychain loop through the actual plastic hole on the end of the key.  But it's too small to allow for free movement, so it is always tangling up my keychain.  The lid appears to be getting looser the more I use it, too.u3.com has the uninstaller product.  It works fine, and now the drive acts just like a 1GB plain data drive.  I recently bought 20 of these for distribution at work.  We unpack them and immediately remove U3 before handing them out - it would be a support nightmare otherwise.  My advice is to buy a drive without U3 or similar technology while you still can.",1

2448,"Horrible support but a good unit. I bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week. It works great. When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan's website showed there were software updates for this unit (Roadmate 2000). I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade. I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked. I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct. I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support. The support group was hard to understand (they are located in India) and were unable to help me. I asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say. They asked that I upgrade the unit again (although the screen showing the firmware and OS versions showed the new version numbers) but by this time I was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade. This unit did not ship with an A/C adapter. I asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he (Tom) informed me there was not. I asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues I might experience with this ""upgrade"" and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions. I asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours. I was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after I told him I thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations. He came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour. It is well over an hour and no call so far. I tried their Corp office and was routed by an ARU back to India. I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management. She said she would send me to Quality Assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary. I spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected. I love the Magellan GPS units and I have three (Blazer 12, Explorist 210 and the Roadmate 2000) and each time I have had to call tech support I am very disappointed. I have to say I will not recommend their products to anyone else since I am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers.To be fair Tom (tech support) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time. However, until then I have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever. If my wife was not already used to the unit I would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer.In summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don't expect good customer service if you need Magellan's help.",1

The review on CNET is misleading - it says that the colors were a bit washed out but they were impressed nevertheless. The only thing that can impress me is how much the colors are washed out.I own quite a bit of Canon photo equipment and I cannot believe that Canon can make such a terrible product. The printer came free with a laptop that I bought and I did not have high expectations for it, of course. But I did not expect it to be that bad for photos. I have seen photos from $80 printers that are brilliant compared to this one. Canon should have advertised this as an office printer with color capabilities.

No problem.About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying ""your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer.""Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams",1

2478,"Be an educated consumer!  You don't have to spend a lot for *digital* cables. You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals. Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel? There's no gold inside! So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables. If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie. Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.With analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).",1

2487,Crappy Tuner. I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future model,1

Unfortunately, there is a charge of $95 to give it a 'hard boot' - according to the technician.  Since it works fine otherwise, I elected to have it sent back and I'll just have to find another brand I can rely on when this one falls apart.I'm giving this 2 stars because it is light and easy to carry and discreetly set on a lecturn.

2489,"Sub par experience. Well, I did considerable research for comparable low-budget microphones.  I have a 3-chip Panasonic consumer video camera and I'm interested in producing documentaries, shorts and travel videos.  My goal was to enhance the audio that came standard with my PV GS300 when filming and capturing both near and far-range audio.I performed a few mic. tests to create a standard for evaluation.  I filmed six scenes.  3 scenes at close-range with these 3 mics, and 3 scenes at long-range using these 3 different mics.  I used iMovie to import my recordings to evaluate the audio.   For this review I tested my on-board stock mic., a Radioshack lavaliere mic. and the Audio Technica mic.  My results are as follows:I. Out-of-the-box standard mic.: Performs with mediocre results, less than desired by Current.tv standards.  The recorded audio has a slight echo/ reverberation, it performs like a stock mic. is expected to perform and produces a somewhat muffled sound.II. Audio Technica Mic.: Disappointing sound quality.  For $53 I expected this mic. to improve upon my equipment's stock microphone; it did not.  The regular setting was just as loud and clear as the stock mic.  The upside is that it had slightly less of an echo than the stock mic. but it also delivered a softer audio recording.  The Tele setting essentially acted as a volume increase; the subject was louder, but so were ambient noises.  Overall it was difficult to distinguish between this mic. and the on-board mic.; and certainly not worth the extra duckets.III. Radioshack lavaliere mic: The audio was significantly enhanced.  When interviewing a subject sitting 3 feet away the recording of both my questions and the subject's answers were louder and clearer.  Down-side : this mic. is less convenient because it requires attaching a corded microphone to the subject's lapel.  There are ways around this like a wireless receiver but what is gained in audio might be lost by creating technical intricacies with your subject.  Don't forget to switch the mic. on; this one also requires a stereo adapter.I was hoping this Audio Technica mic. would provide an increase in performance worth the additional cost.  The lesson I learned is that it is all or nothing.  Shell out $200 for a pro/pro-sumer grade mic. or get by with what you have.   You can improve your situation with a lav. mic. but so far I have not discovered a budget shotgun mic",1

The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.

Though this offers the best protection, it makes the hold button very difficult to reach, since the plastic is 3/32"" thick.2. The bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync/charge cable.  However, because of the proximity of the hinges, it's almost impossible to use the Apple-provided USB sync cable, since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug.

Samsung telephone service help was great and agreed it was defective.  Amazon was terrific and paid for the return and refund.  Be careful with this set and wait a little for other feedback.Oh, one annoying feature.  While the HDTV tuner works well, you cannot dial in a specific digital channel (like 10.1) unless the search program has previously found it.  And there is no way to ""save"" the found digital channels so that you can reposition the antennae, search for signals again, and then have a compiled list channels locked into the memory.  In other words, if your search found 10.1 in one antenna position but not 6.1, there is no way the TV will let you dial in 6.1 even if you reposition the antenna optimally.  You must then reprogram the search to find 6.1, but then after that is completed you wont be able to dial in 10.1 after turning antenna back because the TV did not permanently store that channel prior to the new search.

2533,"Unusable. I bought these for use with my HP DVD740e Lightscribe DVD burner. The device would not write to them. Not one of them! I have never had this problem when using similar blanks with HP and Verbatim labels. The Memorex blanks I had were made by CMC Magnetics. What a waste.FYI - Windows users can get a small -- but distinct -- increase in label darkness with the use of a free utility found on LightScribe's site. It increases the contrast. ""Best"" quality labels do take longer to create.I guess Amazon does not allow web addresses. If you want the utility, search for ""Lightscribe Exstended Label Contrast Utility"" without the quotes. Or you can take a big guess at the name of a commercial site devoted to LightScribe",1

Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all.  Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning.  I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time,1

Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very ""tiny"" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen!

2550,"false advertising claims. The DocuPen holds, at a maximum, 10 pages.  When I called customer service about this, I was told that the unit's capacity was being exceeded because I was scanning ""high resolution images.""  Photos?  No.  Pictures?  No.  I was scanning printed pages from books.  Apparently the DocuPen can only hold around 10 pages of normal text.  The 50 page limit described in their advertising apparently refers to pages with a sentence or 2 on them, rather than actual pages in books or journals--very odd considering it's touted as a tool for students.  A complete waste of time and money.  I returned it and now I'm back to using the photocopier.  Don't bother with this one, it's not at all what they claim",1
2551,"Disappointed. I have been less impressed with the new case for a number of reasons:1)	The additional insulation does cause heat related performance issues.2)	I had to trim the bottom case with a sharp knife so that it didn't catch when opening and closing.3)	Even after trimming the case, as recommended on the Speck website, the bottom part of the case still doesn't secure completely to the laptop (although this could be specific to my machine).4)	The additional weight on back of the screen causes the laptop to shut with considerable more force.5)	The case adds overall weight and size.6)	The case further limits the angle at which the laptop can be opened.Still, I use the top part of the case without the bottom part.  The case provides some protection against the flexible nature of the screen part of the laptop.  If you allow the top to flex you run the risk that external pressure will push the rivets (the ones that attach the apple icon) into the back of your display.  This will cause little dark spots on your screen that don't go away",1

2553,"Inefficient and Ineffective. I've owned this unit for about one year.This unit suffers from 5 problems.1.  The unit gives poor directions.  On a route from Long Island, close to an entrance ramp onto the LIE, to a destination close to a different exit ramp off of the LIE, it told me to take local roads.  That's 100 traffic lights I would hit over local roads.  I did not have any avoidances set in the settings.  This is not an isolated circumstance, but it happens all the time in NYC.In addition, it's constantly trying to take me over toll roads, even though I set an avoidance to toll roads.  I get the feeling that the unit does not really know what toll roads are.  It also likes to take me over roads with lots traffic lights (see previous paragraph).  Although they might be the most direct, this device does not take into account time wasted at traffic lights.  Oy vey!!!!2.  The maps are not updated.  I tried to go to Home Depot through the business search function.  Unfortunately, when I arrived at the ""destination"" - Home Depot was no where to be found.3.  Speech directions are often given too late to actually make the turn.  The unit also gives me turn directions after I've already made the turn.  Moreover, the screen updates slowly.  After you've made the turn, you look at the unit and it still displays your position prior to making the turn.4.  The unit processes so slow.  Searching for businesses by name/category is completely useless.  It literally takes 10 minutes to find an business by name.  Its faster if I text google for the addresses with my Treo and manually enter them into the i3.5.  The input device is really cumbersome.  You really need a keyboard or touchscreen.  Scrolling back and forth through numbers is a giant pain.  In addition, this unit does not speak street names; only left, right, turn, bear, u-turn.  I want to spend time looking at the road, not trying to decipher directions on a tiny screen, to figure out where to make the turn.This unit is really useless.  At least in NYC, where there are many roads.I've wanted to hurl this thing out my window on several occasions.Don't waste your money on this.  Buy something nicer (that actually works) or buy it from a store with a liberal return policy",1
2554,Horrible Customer Support. I had a terrible time with HP's costumer support when I needed help with my scanner.

I set the EQ on treble boost, and I pressed the ""3D"" button on the unit.  Still as muddy and muffled as could be.  Besides that, there was a terrible sound between tracks that reminded me of a CD player searching for the next track.  Amazingly, I never hear this sound when using the nano with headphones.   I am returning this and moving up another price point when searching for my next small speaker set",1

Working with HP is a real nightmare. When I called I was put on hold for 15 minutes each with a series of customer service reps who could not help me. Finally they said they would ship out a replacement unit within 2 days. 10 days later no printer and I called to see what had happened (they did not ship because they had written down a wrong PHONE number for me!) They said the unit would be shipped out ASAP. It did not arrive until nearly another 10 days had passed. By then I had  to buy another printer and just refused delivery on the HP.

Once again Epson customer service shipped me a new replacement printer.  It worked for another two weeks and quit on me yesterday (same problem).

I decided to upgrade an older memorex model with a new sony.  Yes, it did work, but some of the functionality was quirky.  If you press the DVD function button while the DVD is on... the remote will turn it off. So if you want to switch from the stereo or tv functions back to controlling the DVD, you'd better put your hand over the transmitter or it will shut off the DVD player while your watching it.

2586,"Interlink RemotePoint is Poorly Designed. I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!",1

How disapointed did we get.First of all is was nolonger possible to put the labelwriter off, when we went home (not good for environment). Then it became clear that it was no faster then the old Labelwriter 330 turbo and even worse it pulls the label forth and back before printing, which makes changes of labels gettting stuck in the machine very high (which happend to us a lot). Also when printing to it from another computer it stops just before the end, then after a second pushes the last peace of the label true. Which means for us that we pull the label of the machine to soon and then it gets stuck in error mode.

2588,"Tray locked after 2 use. SONY service sucks. The child proof tray lock feature is an absolute nightmare.  There is software issue with this player.  This feature was activated by itself and wouldn't unlock following the procedure in the manual.  Sony support is totally useless.  They recommended steps that I have already tried. The support person was obviously reading from a template as it took him (probably doing support from India) 10 minutes to respond to every simple question.  After struggling for 1 hour, he finally concluded that the unit needs to be sent back.The player is only accepted at SONY's Texas service location.  SONY doesn't provide service locally even though there are tons of SONY stores in my area.  Not only I have to pay shipping out of my own pocket, the turn around time will be about a month.  Worst yet,  the fine print in the support agreement says SONY will ship me back another refurbished unit.I will think twice before buying SONY again",1
2589,"Blah. It looks like I bought this unit based on the very positive reviews only to come back and see the few less than positive reviews that are brand new. I've had this happen on several products now from Amazon - product has a lot of good reviews, I buy it and by the time I go back to review it there are several non-positve reviews. Makes you wonder if some are being written and scored by people involved with the products. Some of the review sound like sales pitches and brochures and I personally question if these are real consumers -  not that I necesssarily think that happened here.I bought this unit to and just received in. So, far I am disappointed in it as well, but I'm not ready to throw in the towel with it yet.The interface takes some getting used to, but I don't find it that horrible compared to others. Some GPS have excellent user interfaces, but most just seem average to below average and the X930 fits in there too. So, I would say its interface is just as bad as most are - there are only a few units with very good interfaces IMO.The POI in this unit seem ridiculous. Michelin tries/wants/is/offers travel type services in general and I thought this unit would be packed with tons of accurate POIs (Points of Interest) - not really. Maybe I expected too much here but I think their POIs are dismal and very dismal if they are a travel services company. This unit should overflow with POI and again, its just about average. Though I will say again, there are onl a couple of very good GPS unit and then there is all the others, so this unit fits in with all the others IMO.Its directions are not fabulous so far either.Any route from my house actually has me drive a circle around my block.I have not found any route from any point in my city where the ""quickest"" or ""shortest"" route is any different and I know of shortcuts.It also wants to route you to the most major interstate and streets even if a less major put acceptable roadways are closer and shorter. For example, from my house to work it routes me 4 miles west to catch the north-south interstate to get me to the west-east interstate. There is a major road that gets me to the west-east interstate less than a mile to my east though. Shorter distance and quicker drive time.Same on my work to home route - it routes me 5 miles past two major roadways in order to stay on the interstate - and it does this regardless of choosing ""quickest"" or ""shortest"". The interstate may be quickest with no traffic, but it is definately not shortest.It does attempt to tell you what lane to be in on the interstate but its been the wrong lane for me about 50% of the time - 25% is due to outdated maps, 25% seems just wrong.I've tried it for some in city driving where I already knew the routes and its routes did get me there, but were not the best or shortest route. I expect a GPS to actually return a shortest route when I ask for it. So far, all the directions I've selected - the shortest route and the quickest route are identical.I am headed on a several hour drive in a couple of weeks and will see how it goes there.Like the other reviewers, the speaker is ridiculous - at the out of the box volume level the speaker is distorted and crackly. Its not loud enough with windows open, vents on medium or with a carfull of conversation. Its adequate if you are concentrated on following its directions.The screen itself is decent. I don't have a big glare issue and the unit responds to my commands ok. The mount is adjustable so glare can be avoided. The unit seems to respond quickly to commands.I don't think this unit calculates routes or picks up your GPS position extremely quickly. It seems about average there too. I've used some other GPS and I would not say they are much better so maybe my expectation is too high. Again, there's the very high end and then everything else and this fits in with everything else.Overall, I am disappointed but I may keep the unit because I need a GPS and I don't see one that seems much much better. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I don't think they are.The MIOs, Garmins, Magellans, etc all have pros/cons and none seem to hit the target completely on price, function, accuracy, interface, etc. They all have their quirks and from playing with several the key items of speed and accuracy don't seem much different. I tried a friends MIO 310x and if I were to review it, my review would sound worse than the Michelin.I've also used a Garmin 350 and other than perhaps the user interface, my review of it would not sound much different.So this seems to be par for the course for the $200-$500 GPS - I did not look at higher priced units, because I'm just plain not interested then.I was really only willing to spend up to $250 on one so my choices were cut down to just 3 units really anyway though I did review some of the $299, $399 and $499 sales units.Up to $250 your choices are the MIO c310x, Michelin X-930 and a Nextar model. I don't think any one is appreciably better than the other so its a dart-shoot.If your expectations are high and you need/want a GPS now with the low end price target then all 3 of these are about the same with their own set of quirks. If you don't need/want a GPS now then I would personally wait for the low end units to be improved. They are not worth it (nor do I think the higher priced models are) until they improve.[...].",1

2596,"2 major design flaws - Buy Kensington version instead. I purchased this product, but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away.The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder!  The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress, the solder breaks.  You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection.  I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter.The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall, it would cause my laptop (IBM T20) to emergency power off.  Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine.  I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter.I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter.  It looks almost like the same product (same OEM?) except they have stronger power tips.  It also didn't have the power-off issue.I loved the form factor, but the product just didn't work",1

The address that Yahoo will map out will not necessarily input to the Magellan.  The second bad point is the loss of signal at key times.  Cloudy days and winter as we have now do not go well with the Magellan.  Several times it has taken forever to pick up or reconnect to the signal.  Third, don't always believe the 360 on what side of the street an address is located or a turn must be executed.Overall I would still buy at the price I paid.

2601,"Garbage - Buttons wore out in 14 mos. I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio.The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem.

While the TiVo service is amazing they really missed the boat with this product.The idea behind this unit is to be able to record two shows at one time; a really great idea that has been available in cable and dish systems for some years.  However, this unit really can't do that for many people.You can ONLY record two shows if you meet ALL of the following conditions:-You subscribe to cable TV-At least one show you want to record is on analouge (not digital) cable-The other show you want to record is on either digital or analouge cableIf you have an antenna, no dice.  Dish newtwork or DirectTV, no dice.  Want to record a show on HBO and Showtime at the same time, no dice.  Basically, you can never really know if the shows you want to record can be recorded or not without having to cross reference them to what part of your cable service they are on.TiVo has the right idea but clearly did not execute it with this product",1

I have to put my ears up against the speakers to actually hear them (I think this may not be due to the wireless speakers so much as the Panasonic system driving them).That's not the most annoying feature though.  Ever since I installed the wireless kit, I've had problems with my wireless home network.  Apparently, this Kit interferes with my wireless g network.  At one point I could not get my network to work at all.  Sometimes, I cannot even use my network while I've got my TV/surround on.  So I have to turn it off just to work on my computer.

2607,Could have been fantastic. This unit could have been fantastic if not for one issue.  Almost all the navigation fuctions cannot be used while the vehicle is moving over 10 miles an hour.  What good is having all this power and information at your fingertips and not be able to use it when you need it.  If you are going down the highway and you want the unit to find a restaurant or an address you have to pull over and stop to enter it into the unit.  This is just plan wrong and there are many other units on the market that will let you imput information without stoping the car.  I can understand not allowing DVD's to be viewed while driving but restricting the ability to imput address into the unit while in motion is just plain stupid. I highly recommend you do not buy this unit as you will be very disappointed,1
2608,"Caveat emptor... Despite being sold as an X-Fi card, this particular model does not use the X-Fi chipset. In fact it uses a variation of the Audigy 2 SE chipset. This is further confirmed by the fact that this card uses different drivers than the rest of the X-Fi line, and is not recognized as an X-Fi card in games. The main problem with this is you cannot uses any of the X-Fi features in games like you would expect. Try using this card in Battlefield 2142 and you will see what I mean.Creative Labs should be ashamed of themselves for this blatant act of marketing fraud. When someone buys a Ferrari, they are expecting to get a Ferrari, not a Honda with a Ferrari emblem on the front. But that is exactly what Creative Labs has done here. They are marketing this sound card as a high-end brand (X-Fi) when it is really a crippled version of the previous product line (SE model Audigy). They must have a glut of unsold chips and they thought they could pull a fast one on consumers with this cheap card.I for one will be very cautious before I consider purchasing Creative Labs products in the future.

This device does a good job of calibating your monitor, but does nothing to help you calibarate your printer.  The software that ships with the device has many options of which most are ""greyed out"".  For instance, options for calibrating your printer are ""greyed out"". Why the heck show the options on the screen, if they are not included in the product!  When you call tech support you get a response in about 36 hours. An overbearing jerk explains that printer calibration is not included in the product, but you can buy another product for several hundred dollars more, which will address that. The same company offers the Huey for about half the price of this device. You would expect for twice your money you would get twice the value - right? Wrong!  As best I can tell the Huey does everything this device does, and more.  This device cannot monitor ambient light, which is a feature of the Huey.The device has two modes for calibrating - simple and complex. Simple works pretty well. Complex is useless.

IT DOESN'T FIT CORRECTLY & YOU CANNOT SEE THE SCREEN. This armband is NOT FUNCTIONAL!I even tried to make it work by fitting some tissue at the bottom to raise it to its ""intended"" position, but inevitably the tissue shifted during the run.  I used the Nike+ armband a total of three times over a 10-mile period and IT CAUSED PROBLEMS DURING EACH RUN.  First, I had trouble adjusting the volume. Second, I accidentally kept pausing my workout trying to play my ""Power Song"" (center button on Nano).  Third, on my longest run, just today, I accidentally erased the workout trying to end the workout without taking the Nano out of its case (I still don't know how I did this).  I was so frustrated after that third negative occurrence that I immediately went out and bought a different case.I'm not going to name drop, but just type in NIKE+ armband and there are several other options (okay, I will name drop).  My favorite, (especially because I did not want to purchase the Nike+ shoes) was the Marware Sportsuit Relay; this set comes with a neoprene Nike+ sensor pouch (to attach to your current running shoes) and a wrist/arm band that covers the entire Nano with room for the additional Nike+ transmitter.Bottom Line - Nike+ system and partnership with Apple Nano = AWESOME!

Hopefully we will see enough bad reports, and Nike will come out with a new, more functional design.",1

I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod!

There is a firmware upgrade available, butsometimes it still refuses to use DVD disks.  And sometimes, for no reason at all, it decides for some reason not to record something. However, I like many of the features, such as Pause Live TV, simultaneous play and record, the ability to use double side Ram cartridges (I have never had a problem with the ones made from Maxell), DVD-Rs, and DVD-RWs. Also, at the highest quality setting, I have made DVD-Rs, finalized them, and it has worked in all the DVD players I have tried.  I also have an older Pioneer DVD model (which is probably the best of all of them except for this), and if you do this, the DVD-Rs sometimes do not work in other players.Onto the D-R5.  I have just bought these for both my sister and my mother as Xmas presents, but I had no idea they would have dropped simultaneous play and record.  I think a lot of the cheaper DVD recorders do not have this, but the better models all do.  It also does not have either the TV-Guide ONscreen guide (which may be a blessing), nor VCR-plus, as it says on the website, as far as I can tell.The picture quality is actually very good, perhaps because it has a digital tuner.  I really am not sure why, as I only have it hooked up to theTV with the RCA cables.  It seems better than the D-R4.By the way, for some strange reason, you cannot use component cables froma D-R4 to a newer Toshiba CRT HD-ready TV, as the tv wants something calledColorStream componnent cables, and the D-R4 does not use these.  I am not sure about the D-R5, but some of the newest upconverting DVD players made by Toshia, do have Colorstream component cables.At any rate, I will take two of these back, and get the Panasonic 25 model.I would have bought a Pioneer model instead, but according to their website, the only DVD recorder they make right now is one with a hard drive.

The Mp3 recorder records the lecture, afterwards, recording is really bad. Sometimes it doesn't record at all or it erases the file or there is an error. In addition, the volume/sound quality is bad. Not loud enough. In the end, you need the software to transfer files, takes forever to figure out what to do. My brothers bought Mp3 player called Matchspeed (red color), good price and it worked great. Best player we ever had, 3 times louder then scan disk and the best thing, no software needed to transfer files. Just drag he items into the folder, thats all to it. And it records great.

I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.

If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.

The one and only reason I purchased this label printer was for the highly touted Dymo Stamps feature, supposedly giving you the ability to print your own postage stamps onto thermal postage labels for no monthly fee, only the cost of the printer and the thermal label refills.  According to the Dymo Stamps website, Dymo Stamps gives you the ability to ""Print Exactly the Amount of Postage you Need"" and ""Eliminate the Need for Costly Postal Meters.""  What the consumer is not told upfront is that these ""precise"" amounts of postage can only be in denominations of the Dymo Stamps software's choosing, not any amount you want.  In fact, the only postage denominations that can be printed are those already available in stamp form at the post office, basically just your run-of-the-mill $0.39 stamps, $4.05 Priority Mail stamps, and postcard stamps.  This software also does not give you the capability to print postage for Parcel Post, Media Mail, or Express Mail, and doesn't allow you to add additional postage for services like insurance or certified mail at all.  How this saves you any trouble over buying stamps from the post office is beyond me.  Conveniently, you can only overcome all of these limitations by subscribing to Endicia (Dymo Stamps' backbone provider) for a monthly fee.  Heck, you can't even go to an office supply store to buy the thermal postage label refills that you need to print postage on; they can only be ordered online through a link in the Dymo Stamps software.  Especially given the fact that even the least expensive Dymo Stamps capable LabelWriter model is over $100, this will NOT save you any money in postage, will NOT save you any time, and ordering stamps online from USPS (or getting them from the local post office) is just as convenient, if not more convenient, than ordering the stupid thermal refills online from Dymo and waiting for them to arrive.  Thankfully, Amazon is great at accepting returns",1

Tuned into truckers' channel 17 (for North-South traffic) and heard mostly noise.  There was very little discernible language so I squelched out the noise and waited...and waited.  I called out for a radio check and got a comeback--loud but not clear.  The speaker in that hand held CB is awful.  It's abrasive to listen to.It is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker.This CB radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road.  Perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying.

At first I was baffled by the lack of instructions and the apparent lack of attachment screws. By reading another of the reviews here in Amazon I learned that the screws arrive inserted into the bottoms of the ""X"" pieces. Thanks to the person who pointed this out, as it isn't intuitively obvious even to those of us long accustomed to putting together small mechanical devices for our children.I managed to figure out the proper hex key wrench to remove the screws and then quickly put together the keyboard stand. Once you have all of the pieces and the proper tool it's not rocket science. However, it soon became apparent that the stand isn't really made for my model keyboard. If you line the keyboard up directly on the stand it rocks back and forth. The only way to get it to stay put is to angle it a bit, which looks kind of odd  And there's a constant danger that someone will knock the keyboard right off of the stand onto the floor. Someone suggested a double-velcro strategy--not bad!  But this is a makeshift solution that can only partly mask the fact that the stand was never really designed for the keyboard I own.

If you have a dedicated 16x9 screen, like I have, this will not work if you like a clean image at the edge of the screen.  If I mount the projector to fill the screen, then the 4x3 DVD image is projected above and below the screen.  Perhaps I don't have it setup correctly, but that was the best I could do.  Specs say this projector has component video inputs, which it does.  However, they are part of the monitor input jack and you have to spend another $20.00 for an adapter to connect to them.

2741,"JUNK. I read another review on here complaining about the ""sticky buttons"" on the Audio Source EQ 200. After reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems, I decided to take a chance, hoping that the other reviewer's button problem was an isolated incident. Wishful thinking. I've had the EQ 200 for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine. I was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out. At first I thought it might be a loose cable, or worse, a problem with the cartridge on my turntable. Then I remembered the review about the ""sticky buttons."" Sure enough, I went to the EQ and jiggled the buttons, and the sound cut in and out as I did so. After jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while, then it out of nowhere started acting up again. It's not so much that they ""stick,"" as it is that they just plain don't work properly. The have a ""cheap"" feel to them; all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket. When you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move. Besides the fact they don't work, they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted. They don't let you monitor the tape deck's output when recording; something that should be a standard feature of an EQ. The buttons on my old Radio Shack/Optimus EQ made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbing/monitoring. There are a couple other annoyances on the Audio Source, too. The analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment; when I play my CD player, the display is just maxed out. You can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs, but I only want to turn down the display, NOT the volume! The ""0"" line on the EQ should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders, but it is simply white like all the lines, which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line. If I were keeping the unit, I would take care of this problem with a magic marker. There are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs, leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced. The sound quality seems decent when it works, but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while you're listening to your music? The illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat, but hey, I don't buy a stereo component just for looks. Seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue, I'm sure Audio Source has to be aware of the problem. Obviously, they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer. It's too bad, since this model seems to be pretty much the only EQ left on the market for a home stereo. The only other EQ I found other than professional models for rack-mount systems, was a TEAC model which doesn't have as many inputs as the Audio Source. I am returning the Audio Source for a full refund; no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect. I guess I will try my luck with the TEAC, either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an EQ. I will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if I want to do any dubbing with the TEAC",1

Battery case - this is a flimsy piece of plastic and the finger that enables the cover to click shut will break with the slightest pressue. I totally agree with the other people who commented on this issue. Yes you can prevent it from breaking if you are willing to spend 5-10 minutes to slowly change the batteries but once you tend to hurry up with this process the end is inevitable!2. Power off - the power off si the same as play or power on. If you want to power it off you got to press until you see the unit display switch off else it will stay powered on and playing and drain the battery or probably if in recording more might use up your entire storage space.3. Chord - comes with  chord to hang the unit around the neck while listening to stuff but unfortunately just like the battery case, the groove on the unit into which you are supposed to slip the chord and fasten it, is flimsy as well. It might break off if you have it caught somewhere and try to pull it free instead of patiently working it.4. UI is bad - the IPOD click wheel is very simple and so is the Zune UI. This one is simple cos there is just one way to use it but its not easy to use.Go for a IPOD Nano if you will. This one is not worth the investment",1

2762,"The good, the bad, and the ... really bad. I've often wondered how many people review things on amazon when they first buy them. Had I done so, i'd have posted only the good, and would have forgotten by the time it got really bad.The good:When I first purchased 2 of these, my first run to a customer went fantastically well. I copied the files via windows explorer to the drive, which showed up in My Computer under windows, as you'd expect, and presto, no problems.The bad:- Sometimes the drive won't turn off by the power button on the front. Sometimes it will. It's like my 2 year old child. It's got an unreasonable and emotionally uncontrollable reaction to what you do.- Customer support is crazy. Crazy! I spent a long long time explaining my problem, what i'd done to solve it, the steps I took and provided a screen shot - only to wait a day and get an automated response - which had nothing to do with the problem, and i'd already reviewed prior to submitting the question because they force you to - and the ""person"" who responded proceeded to provide feedback and steps that did not address the issue, solve the problem or leave me with the impression that he understood what he was doing.- The first backup performed with their software took overnight - that's fine, it really was 300GB of uncompressed data on a windows drive - but when it was done, it wasn't - their backup software puts it's own ""restore"" binaries in the directory you created at backup time - and for this one, it didn't. It seems the backup software is unable to backup when you input over 50GB of data at a go. The workaround, though, is to break it up into smaller chunks. PITA when you have a system for ""filing"" within your windows directories, but livable considering the bigger PITA to backup to DVD :)- The drive makes not so nice sounds when shutting down. Yes, it's a known ""issue"" - they say it's not an issue, but when you shell out a lot of money on your drive, your heart stops for a moment when you hear a painful clicking sound. You know, the sound your drive makes a day or two before it stops working. Yup, it's that one. For what it's worth, i've had the drives on for roughly a month without a problem - but you should be aware that it'll be a little strange the first time you hear it.The really bad:- The backup software refuses to work. The problem I have is that it wasn't predictable in how it chose to .. stop working. I installed the drive, did a backup. That overnight backup. Which failed. The next morning I did the backup in smaller chunks and when i came back from work, sure enough it was fine. Great. I performed more backups over the course of a week. No problems. Last week I launched the software, selected the folders i wanted to backup, even selected the files - and the software insists on telling me ""Please select the files to be backed up"". Nothing changes this message. I'd removed the drivers/software, rebooted, reinstalled, uninstalled just the backup software, reinstalled - it doesn't matter - it just simply refuses to work.- The diagnostic tool that their website and their techical support people will tell you to use is useless. When you launch it, it does a SmartScan - which, if things are fine, it says ""Pass"" and you think ""great"". The problem is when it says ""Info unavailable"" - what does that mean? You check the help files, right? There's nothing in there that mentions what it means - or mentions it at all. So I reviewed the responses I got from technical support - which provided me a link - and the information in the link simply reiterated their software help info - which was useless. I'm a self service junkie. I don't want to call you. I don't want to email you. If I have a problem, I want to read the manual, or your website, or your forum. While I don't really believe i'm the first to have a problem with their backup software, I absolutely refuse to believe i must have been the first one to ask what ""info unavailable"" means. Help me help you help me! :)I think for me the issue is now trust. I think the data on the HD is fine - but considering the application stopped working out of the blue - who's to say the application in each directory I made a backup of on this drive won't stop working too? It works today, but there's no telling if it'll work tomorrow. Yes, I could manually copy the files - but when you're backing up 2TB of data, incremental backups really are the way to go. Another potential workaround is to purchase another vendor's backup software. Which i've done, and not yet tried - but this is wholly not the point. Don't shlep cheap and buggy software off, charge $25 more than the version of the product without it, and market it as ""backup software that provides the world in gold"" - that's just wrong. And frustrating.As a result, I won't be buying this drive again. I highly recommend you don't either. There are plenty of competing products on the market already, and if you're going to buy someone else's backup software - you might as well buy a hard drive from a vendor that invests in competent online and software support. After all, as of today, what were you spending that extra $25 on",1

I really wanted to like this phone from all the good reviews, but received one with issues, returned it and received another with the same issues; so it must be the phone model.The below items do not involve using the handset speakerphone feature which requires a ""wait for you"" ""wait for me"" behavior; just normal handset.-When you first answer an incoming call, you usually have to wait a few seconds for the phone to make available 2 way converstion; otherwise, you can say hello and the caller can't hear you and you can't hear them.-During a call using normal handset, background noise and even regular conversation can cause the phone to block the volume of the caller as though you are using the speakerphone feature when you're actually not.

2772,"Product Has Bugs, Customer Service Won't Help!!!. I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying ""I can't believe you Americans"" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again.By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.Jeff",1

I used the router WGT624 for several months just as a firewall directly hooked into my computer and never had any problems.  A few days ago however I moved my computer and decided to use this USB card and have had nothing but problems since.  Half the time on start up my computer will not be connected so I have to reboot. Sometimes multiple reboots and then it still doesn't work and I have to unhook everything, router, cable modem, etc.  I don't know how or why this happens but it seems to make everything stuck and nothing can communicate again until I do this.  This has happened several times so I am not imagining this.  I try various things but ultimately I have to shut everything down and actually unplug the modem from the power source for a few seconds then start everything back up.  I have cable and this is a procedure they have you do sometimes if things get locked up, usually when you have a bad connection.  I didn't have to do this when it was just hooked into the router, but with this USB P.O.S. I am doing it every day, sometimes several times a day.  Then it shows a connection of like 55% and the router is in the very next room.  That is with the door open, not 20 feet away.  Even now as I sit here writing this the little computer on the task bar showing my connection has dropped to yellow.  At least it hasn't changed red...........crap, just did, not #%^%$ kidding!  .....................Okay, back on line.

2783,"Update: Password can't be registered. Read my initial review below which was on July 27.  On August 11, Kensington told me that they do not know when the password registration process will be working, and they strongly urged me to send the product back for a refund.On July 27 I wrote:This should be a great item at a great price.  And as far as I can tell, it works fine.  Kensington has some serious technical problems, however.   The encryption installs and becomes fully-functional before you can register your USB key and password.  Registration is essential in case you lose the key or forget your password.  This is a BIG problem, because as of July 26, 2006,  Kensington's registration utility was down and not expected to be working until 6-10 days(current estimate).  Worse, the message I got when attempting to register my key the first two days was ""Authentication Failed"" which told me nothing.  Even worse, their overseas technical support person did not know about the problem. So he also thought I had a defective key, and we wasted a lot of time discussing replacement and timing (I'm about to leave on a trip and really wanted this protection for the trip).  When I finally realized that I would not receive a new key before I left, I asked whether I should uninstall the product or whether I could register the key verbally in case the key was lost on the trip (I figured the answer was no but I was getting desperate).  He went away for a long time, then he reported that he would have to call me back (that took 40 minutes) and finally he reported that probably my key was fine, it's the registration that was offline.  And no, there is no other way to register - that's part of the security.So the encryption is in place, the laptop boots and runs fine, but I have two days to decide whether to risk taking my laptop and losing the physical key, which means I would have to wipe my hard drive, or risk uninstalling the encryption and having the laptop stolen, in which case I still lose all my data AND sensitive data is exposed.  The laptop will be at risk in hotel rooms, and the key will be at risk on my person as I will be swimming and snorkeling. Kensington claims the thing is waterproof - maybe I'll just buy one of those little waterproof capsules and keep it around my neck.",1

2786,"The other reviews are correct. I've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters. One of them was on an older Dell laptop,installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a Linksys WRT54G router with WAP encryption.The problems really started showing when I tried to install the second and third adapters, both on desktop computers running Windows XP SP2. The software installation was a breeze, but when I plugged in the adapter - nothing happened. Connect to network...which network? Scan..who? What?It looks like this adapter has a very, very short range and doesn't work very well a wall or two in between the routers. It would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one. But then it would find it again, and on and off.Never really worked as expected on the desktops, so I've given up. I've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times. Downloaded the updated software from Belkin's site, and still have connection issues with the desktops. The laptop works fine as long as I don't take it one room away from the router.Avoid at all costs please. I've used other wireless devices with the same router that I'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all.Spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent. Spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing.Good luck",1

But then I saw this Sylvania 26"" HDTV for $499.00 and thought it was time to move up to high tech for a few dollars more.  I ordered it and received great service with quick 2 day delivery.  However, I was immediately dissapointed with the picture quality, much worse then my old TV of 18 years, but I still had hope because I was still waiting for my HD cable box.  After 10 days I got my HD cable box installed and while I saw a big improvement it was still not the quality picture I expected.

2794,"DO NOT USE AS BOOT DRIVE. I recently purchased this item, and I was extremely disappointed.  It was a horrible experience trying to install this item.  The instructions for the drive did not match the type of drive, and on the western digital website, it didn't even list this drive to get instructions for.  So, I followed the instructions that came with it to a T, to install the drive as a boot drive, copying all my information from my current drive, which was about to fail.  It seemed to copy the files just fine and work ok as a slave drive, but then my original hard drive failed, and I moved this supposidly boot drive to be the single drive on my machine it would not work.  Upon calling customer service to find out what was wrong, I was asked, did you make the boot drive through windows or dos?  I told her I just popped in the disk they gave me and ran it, and followed the instructions, click on ""I want to make a boot drive"" and not on ""I want to make a drive for additional service.""  She said that it sounds like I did it through windows mode, and it won't make a boot drive in windows mode, only if I was in dos mode.  I asked her why this was not explained in the instructions, and now I had no original boot drive to try to do it again.  She told me to run windows recovery.  I asked if she could help me do that, because I couldn't figure it out, and she said no, windows isn't our product so we won't help you with that.  I said, but if this is what I need to install this drive, it says you are supposed to offer me free installation help for 30 days, why won't you help me.  Then I was spoken to as if I was a problem customer - you know, ""MAAM, I TOLD YOU I CAN'T HELP YOU"" in a nasty tone.I ended up going out, buying another hard drive to use as my primary and then installing windows from scratch, and having to reinstall all the drivers and programs I had on this new drive and I kept the western digital drive for a backup.All in all,  I thought this was a waste of money, a waste of hours upon hours of time, and a terrible experience.  I would never recommend purchasing this product",1
2795,"More development work to be done by Pharos. Yes, it's inexpensive when compared to some alternatives, but the devil is in the details.  These suppliers all differentiate themselves on the software and feature set since the underlying chips tend to be common, so this is where you will want to focus when comparing.Things I like about this system:1.	The hardware is well done, though the cable to the receiver could be a little longer.2. 	The option to view satellite positions in their software is really neat.3. 	Integration with contacts for route planning is nice.However, I just returned my Pharos system for the following reasons:1.	It crashes my Dell Axim X5 PDA, and this is apparently a known issue.  On investigation, the vendor's web site has a FAQ on what to do in this situation.  Unfortunately this is not a rare occurrence, and it is clearly a software bug.2.	Another bug in the navigation software showed my distance (as a bird flies) increasing to the destination while I was actually headed towards it on the interstate prescribed by the routing software.  After about 45 minutes of this, it abruptly fixed itself as if nothing had ever gone wrong.3.	The route calculation is so slow as to be unusable, and this is on a 400MHz Dell Axim X5 with a ton of memory- a very highest performance device.4.	Map inaccuracies are such that it occasionally indicates the user is off-route while on a major highway or the interstate.  I think that this is a case where map position coordinates for the roadway are at least 50 to 100 feet in error.5.	Maps have to be manually loaded from region to region.  Even if present in the memory, the user has to instruct the software to use it.  This is a big hassle, and one that is not tolerable while driving.6.	Generated routes are terrible in town and out, and I found myself using a paper map for the sake of efficiency instead of this system.  As an example of how ridiculous things can be, the device instructed me to exit Interstate 20 in the middle of nowhere then immediately get back on the highway.  This was not related to a map inaccuracy; the exit ramp, stop sign, and entrance ramp were exactly where they were indicated to be but the instructions made no sense.There are also a number of product features and tweaks that should be addressed (in my opinion):1.	A route builder tool is needed where the user is presented with route options, or can constrain the routing engine to use a certain highway or road set.  Without real time traffic information, school zone locations, etc, this would be necessary even if the routing engine were good.  And wile not a panacea, this would also speed the calculations up as a side effect.2.	The display should auto center when one zooms.  Drawing a zoom box on the screen only instructs the unit what scale you wish to see rather than zooming in on a specific region.3.	The map view tool is weak, making the process of transferring maps to your PC and Pocket PC slow and tedious.4.	There should be an option to adjust the amount of detail shown on the map: low, medium, high.  I saw situations at both extremes that I would have liked to adjust (actually needed to in one case).5.	It would also be nice to have basic trip computer features like ETA at destination as well as waypoints or road changes, average speed, a speed profile, etc.6.	The unit should be able to store and upload actual detailed routes to Pharos' web site for analysis.  This would allow them to tweak their routing engine to a point of usability, and perhaps generate rules or algorithms that would allow it to finish calculating before you arrive.Conclusion: At its current stage of development, this is a toy at best.  I don't what alternative to suggest yet, but would like to hear from you if you have a good one.Best Regards,Ro",1
2796,"Frustrating. On the surface, this is a slick mouse. It's cute, small, full-featured, and stowing the receiver in the mouse is great.But after using this for a week and a half, I'm ready to throw it out.Let's see:1) It refuses to turn back on after being stored. I'll pull it out of my laptop bag, plug-in the receiver, and... no juice. The mouse doesn't turn on, even though it's automatically supposed to turn after you unstow the receiver. I have to open the mouse up and reseat the batteries.2) Sometimes when I plug the receiver into my laptop, it doesn't get recognized. I try multiple ports and nothing. Once I reboot, it's ok.3) The absolutel LAST STRAW: as of last night, the mouse motion will suddenly freeze. You'll be mousing around and the mouse will suddenly lock  up. The buttons will click, the mousewheel will still scroll the page - but the cursor will be frozen. It only becomes ""unstuck"" when you scroll the wheel. It's absolutely aggravating to be working on my design work only to get stuck mid-movement, scroll the wheel, move the mouse, figure out where my cursor has now gone (it places it randomly), and then go back to work - only to repeat the process all over again 30-60 seconds later.I'm really disappointed. I've bought a few other Wenger products and never had a problem. I honestly didn't think twice when I was looking for a wireless mobile optical and saw this one with the Wenger logo.

You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is ""hinged"" at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in & out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!

I ordered this television with high hopes, knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle.  But you get what you pay for.  Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad firmware.  What does this mean to you?For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again.  Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help.  My TV was completely bricked.  A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase.  For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV.  I say a ""visit"" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for TVs under 32"", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled.So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it.  Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either).I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006.  Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one.  If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you.",1

I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player",1

2844,"BEWARE SAMSUNG DLP DESIGN FLAWS!!!. Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to ""turn it off"", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!I have a 42"" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26"" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP",1

Because your digital signal is comprised of ""0's"" and ""1's"" if you can see your TV or hear the music then what ever cable you use works-  There is no distortation across digital signals, so don't pay the extra money- In fact you shouldn't need to spend more than around $30-50.",1

This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night.Unfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor.  Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver.  Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony",1

It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.

We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.

2864,"Almost impossible to use with large-capacity iPods. I have this cable installed on a CDA-9856 deck, using a 60GB iPod Photo. The interface completely circumvents everything that is good about the interface on the iPod itself.1. The controls and display on the iPod are disabled when connected the head unit. You MUST use the head unit to control the iPod, and you cannot see information about the currently playing track on the iPod.2. When searching through artists, albums, songs, or playlists on the deck, only one item is viewable at a time (contrasted with 5 or 6 items viewable on the iPod screen itself). This makes it extremely dangerous to browse through your music while driving if you don't already know exactly what you want to listen to.3. One ""tick"" of the control knob on the deck scrolls through 1 item (artist/album/song/playlist) on the iPod. Scrolling does not speed up as you continue to turn the knob. If you want to scroll through 200+ artists, expect to spend fully 2 minutes or more twiddling the knob. While driving. I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is.4. There is absolutely no way to speed up the process: there is no fast scrolling mode that skips through 10+ artists at a time, there is no way to scroll by letter of the alphabet, no nothing.5. When scrolling through items, the menu returns to the beginning of the list each time you pull it up. If you spend 90 seconds scrolling to ""New Order"", then next you want to listen to something by Nirvana, have fun scrolling for another 90 seconds.It's as if Alpine didn't bother to user test this system AT ALL with large-capacity iPods.

I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more.The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long",1

2867,"Good printer when it works. First, the print quality is very good.  When it does work, it seems to work very well.  I was pleased with the print quality and features, and the print speed is excellent.But the real problem is the extremely unstable software.  More than half the time, I could not start a scanning operation without it failing.  And when it fails, it really fails, and the only way to get it back working again is to pull the plug on the printer (that's right - the power button won't turn off the printer power when this happens), AND restart the computer which was the target of the scan output.   Since I normally do a fair amount of scanning, this meant most days having to reboot both printer and computer, just to do a simple scanning job.The printing software was also iffy, although not nearly the problem as was the scanner software.   Probably 10% of the time, a print job would not complete.The HP Image software which came with the printer was a very useful and straight-forward photo-processing tool, which I would recommend for the most part.  HP chose, however, to ignore all the normal Windows software conventions, (like having a File and Edit menu at the top of the screen), so you are always having to hunt around on-screen for what you want to do.Bottom line:  I hate playing the ""print/scan lottery"", wondering whether my print or scan job will actually work, each time I try to print or scan something.   This is not a finished product, and I strongly recommend buying something else",1

Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are ""uncomfortable as sin"". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return.If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..",1

After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor.Looking at the pieces that came apart, I saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece. But the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the DVDs facing upward, and they were the same on all 16 boxes.I emailed the manufacturer (from whom I had bought 12 of the boxes) and asked, since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back, and costly for them, what would they offer me if I just kept them and glued the corners together. I had absolutely no response.I ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart, glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them.

The problem is that the Sony implementation is mediocre at best.  The user interface is *terrible*; so bad you almost can't believe that they'd release a product like this.  You need a keyboard to do anything reasonable, and the ""Load info from DVD"" feature barely works.  And when it does, it's wrong and uneditable.  The remote control is so poorly laid out that it's almost comical.  The most important button, to get a list of your DVDs, is labeled ""Folders"" and is tiny and in a bad location.  Plus once all your DVDs are loaded, then what?  You only can support one TV...I have other TVs and a DVD player in the car, so I either have to unload them (and the device forgets everything), or have to copy all the DVDs that I need to use on multiple machines.If you are not sure whether to get this, I'd consider buying your movies from iTunes and using an AppleTV, or some other similar model.  You might also consider any fair use provisions that let you keep a copy of the DVDs you rightfully own for permanent insertion into this device (although the interface is still absolutely horrible).If the remote and user interface were actually functional and elegant, I'd probably feel differently about this product",1
2888,"Linux Users Beware. I purchased this card after borrowing a card with an identical product number from a friend. My friend's card worked out of the box with my version of Ubuntu Linux.When I received my card, it simply did not work. After doing some research, I found that I had a card with a different version number, and a different chipset. My friend's card had a chipset made by Atheros, which worked out of the box. The card that I purchased had a Broadcom chipset, which is notorious for being incompatible with Linux. Even after going to the forums, I was unable to make the card work.Belkin is dishonest, in that it makes changes to the chipset without changing the product number, only the version number, which the consumer is not made aware of. Had I been aware that the card had a different chipset, I would not have ordered it",1
2889,"This stopped working after about a week. When I was christmas shopping, I thought this looked really cute, and I figured, ""Hey, it's cheap, and looks good.""  So I bought it.  It worked pretty well for the first couple of days, and then the CD playing system on it just decided to stop working.  I checked all things that I might have possibly done wrong, but I didn't find any.  When you try to load the CD, it doesn't let you play anything.  I would not recomend this product for whoever wants to buy it, because it did not work like I wanted it to, and it made a pretty lousy Christmas present after I found out it had broken.  DON'T BUY THIS",1

As another reviewer stated below, after a couple of years, when using my cordless phone, I started to hear static, then eventually, I heard a very loud, annoying pulse tone which the person I called also heard.Assuming the line noise was due to my phone/DSL line, I called my telephone service provider to check the line. I was thinking of changing my DSL line filters or buying a new phone (assuming some problem with my Panasonic 2.6 GHz phone). When I figured out this device was responsible, the Zapper went immediately into the garbage.Not sure what started the problems (bad battery?, latent defect?). In the end, am not sure how effective this device is as I still received plenty of unsolicited calls. In any case, this device was not worth the trouble and cost.",1

A USB port hub will almost be as good as this docking station - with the exception of a place to hook the monitor.

2896,"BEWARE of Kingston REBATES!. Beware of KINGSTON rebates!Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying ""your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer.""Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams",1
2897,"Are you kidding???  Good sound from a $5 pair of headphones???. Com'on folks...let's be real here.  The Coby CV-H42 headphones may have decent sound for a pair of cheap headphones, but com'on...they're only $5 or less.  I've tried them on a non-amplified computer monitior at work, and they sound decent.  The bass is average at best.  If these have a 40mm driver, then I'd hate to hear what a smaller one in a Coby set would sound like.I've also tried them on my at-home 5.1 amplified PC set-up and they distort way too easily.  The bass distorts at almost the slightest bit of bass.And I concur with those who say that it's a roll of the dice to get a good working pair, as the left-speaker in my set is a bit weak.I mean let's face it...these are some pretty cheap headphones...if you want a cheap, but great sounding pair of headphones, you better look to a set in the $15+ range.  Take for instance the KOSS KTX-PRO 1 Titaniums for $18 here on Amazon.  They're sold for upwards of $45 at retailers like Radio Shack.  And from all the glowing reviews, they're a hellava set of headphones.I gave this set 2-stars only because they're decent for a cheap pair, but for audiophiles, stear clear",1

Even at the highest resolution setting, recipients of my faxes complain about not being able to make out even typed text.  The dusty old laser fax I paid five dollars for at a garage sale takes much longer-lasting toner cartridges and completely outclasses the FAX-575.  The 575 is, however, a surprisingly adequate phone, with exceptional volume and voice quality.  Go figure",1
2908,"Good audio, lousy handset interface. Once again, a consumer electronics hardware maker proves that they can't develop a good software interface for their device. In terms of physical design, this is one of the best cordless phones out there. The sound quality is also quite good, and the DECT technology works on a band that keeps it free of WiFi interference. However, I had to return this phone right away because the interface is so awful. First of all, Philips really shortchanged this device by putting in a cheap LCD display that can only display 8 letters on caller ID, and then they are letters formed in barely legible block-style on the numerical display. I mean, how much more would if have cost them to put in a modern LCD display with enough pixels to show real letters? But the clincher is the poor design of this phone's Caller ID interface. Call it Caller Confusion. If you have Caller ID with Name service from your phone company, with this phone you can only see the name -- and only the first 8 letters of it! While the phone call is coming in, there is no way to scroll the display to show the phone number. You can only see that AFTER the phone has stopped ringing. What use is that? If the incoming phone call actually has a name from the phone company, this is barely OK, but for the many calls that have no name, this phone will show ""CELL PHO"" or ""UNKNOWN"" or ""800 SERV"". There is no way to get it to show the actual number while the phone is still ringing. If you're trying to screen calls, it's essentially useless. Whoever designed this interface just doesn't get what Caller ID is for in the first place. I would have loved to like this phone, because I think the phones from Panasonic, VTech, Motorola and others are horribly ugly, and my previous Panasonic had the worst audio quality imagnable. But this phone doesn't cut it as well. Why is the cordless phone market so devoid of good products",1

I've been using Sony's ECM-MS907 for more than 5 years now and have loved it; so two weeks ago I ordered the Sony ECM-CS10 to use for audio journal keeping while on the road.  When it arrived just a few days ago, I compared the audio quality of its recordings to that of my existing Sony microphone.  In spite of its pleasing aesthetics, I found it to be a sad disappointment!!!  The ECM-CS10 is a very noisy microphone with an audio quality far inferior of what I would expect from a Sony mic.  (I wonder whether this is because it is a plug-in-power mic).Frankly, I think I'm probably going to return it and look for something else.  I've purchased a number of microphones on eBay and have only been satisfied with one other type of compact mic.  Microsound makes it; and its a mic with a cable lead about three inches long.  I'm not in any way affiliated with them, but I would recommend their product.With all of this said, I think I still might spring for Sony's top-of-the-line lapel microphone, just to see whether it's any good",1

The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal ""automatic"" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2.So I called back again. And again. And again.Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person.Install from CD. Reboot. etc.It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort.I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card!I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650.Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it.

2929,"A niche product that falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, I found the Nexus to be a very niche product. I'm sure anyone who is researching this product knows by now that it does not allow you to listen to live XM content on the go. Fair enough, since it never claimed to. However, the idea of this being such a small player only for use of MP3 content and recorded XM content did not impress me.The screen is incredibly small. Of course, this isn't a problem if you are using this player hand held, or in a situation where you don't want to see the display anyway. However, listening to live XM content is entirely different. Don't expect to have this receiver docked in the home kit a yard away from you, and still have the ability to read the screen.This also becomes a problem in the car. I drive a small compact two-door car, and had the receiver mounted at eye level on the dash. I could see the display okay. Not perfect, but okay. My passengers, however, could not see the display at all. Before you have the chance to think of any bad eyesight jokes, I have had both an XM Roady 2 receiver and a Sirius Audiovox PNP3 receiver mounted in this same position, and never got any complaints. Adjusting the brightness and contrast didn't do much good. The artist text is easier to see than the title text, as it is in bold letters. Having a black and white screen did not help.To record live XM content, you must begin the recording within 45 seconds of the start in order to get the entire selection. This may be great when you hear the first notes of a song you know, love, and want to record, but it's a huge flaw for discovering new music. How many of us can decide within the first 45 seconds of a song whether it is or isn't a song we'll want to hear again? Since XM boasts of having the largest play lists on Satellite Radio, how can you assume that song you just heard on Deep Tracks will be a song you will ever hear again on XM?Wait, you could've just add it to your TuneSelect, so it will notify you next time it is played and you can record it then, right? Nope. The Nexus does not include a TuneSelect. Nor does it even include a memory option, where you can store the artist and song title. There is an option titled ""Bookmark"" though, where the Nexus and the included Napster software will make it easier for you to find and purchase any song you ""Bookmark"" when you have the Nexus connected to your PC. However, I could find no way to see what songs I bookmarked without using the included Napster software.The User Interface on the Nexus could use a lot of help. There are way too many buttons to press to find your way around the unit. Simply going from Live XM to Recorded/MP3 content can take a while. Be prepared to wander around aimlessly with this receiver for at least the first few hours.Of course, this receiver does not have the 1-10 presets that other satellite radio receivers do. I did find switching between stations more challenging while driving due to this. You can set up a ""favorites"" category list on the Nexus, but I would have liked more options for customization with this category.Both the Nexus Home Kit (included with the receiver) and the Car Kit come with remotes. I found the remotes to be pointless though. The remotes could have offered an easier way of getting to your favorite channels, but there was no such option. The number keys on the remote only guided you in accessing a channel if you knew the channel number. If you could dock your Nexus across the room and see the display clear enough, the remotes may have been of more use.As for MP3s, you are able to search by artist or song title, but not album. You just transfered the entire Led Zeppelin II album onto your Nexus, and you want to play it from start to finish? Well, if you have some other Led Zeppelin songs on your Nexus, you'll have to find ""Whole Lotta Love"" and begin playing there. The album title will not be displayed on the Nexus screen though, and the track number won't be either. I'm not expecting the Nexus to be an iPod, but I did find this to be an extreme annoyance.Note that the Nexus can be partitioned to store either 50% XM content and 50% Personal content, or 100% XM content. Don't expect to fill 1GB of your own MP3 collection.The Nexus also contains a new technology for XM known as the Passport. The passport is a small chip that is docked directly behind the Nexus in the home or car kit. It is not and cannot be physically connected to the Nexus. The passport is only required for Live XM content. If you purchase a Nexus and activate it with XM, you are not actually activating the Nexus. You are activating the XM passport. Essentially, you can purchase as many Passport enabled receivers as you desire and only pay one subscription fee, assuming you will only want to listen to live XM content on one receiver at a time. Of course, this is a plus side to the Passport technology. If you only have the desire to own one Nexus, it can be a real pain to have to carry around and dock both the Nexus and the Passport with you every time you go from the car to home. The Passport's small size could make it much easier to be lost or misplaced as well.I have heard that satellite radio companies make it hard for thieves to get away with stealing equipment. The victim of the theft just needs to contact the company, and they will blacklist the ID of the receiver so it cannot be reactivated. The Passport makes the Nexus an easier target, since it is impossible for the receiver to be blacklisted, due to the ID coming from the Passport.Although I am well aware that the car kit is sold separately, I feel the need to mention in this review that I was not comfortable with the cosmetics of the car dock. The bright silver color of it made it very easy to see, regardless of the time of the day or the amount of light coming into my car. Needless to say, I was concerned that this would be a huge theft magnet. Most satellite radio receivers and mp3 player car docks are much more low profile, and for good reason.Although I'm sure this is the result of stricter FCC guidelines, FM Modulation is only an option with the car kit. Unlike previous satellite radio receivers I have owned, you can use any FM frequency you desire with the Nexus. One thing to note is that the FM Modulation will not work if you have anything plugged into the ""Line Out"" of the car kit, such as a cassette adapter or axillary cables. I was very disappointed that no FM Modulator is included with the home kit.I can't say there is nothing positive about the Nexus though...Loading your personal music collection onto the Nexus is very simple. You can even simply do a copy/paste or drag and drop though Windows. I used Rhapsody instead of Napster to load some of my songs onto the Nexus, and it worked perfectly.I also liked that there was an equalizer included. Of course this is an expected feature of an MP3 player, but it also works with live XM content.It doesn't play only MP3s either. I have all of my music library encoded with iTunes AAC, with a VBR of 128Kbps. I had no problems with playback of these files.Overall, the Nexus does what it is advertised to do. I feel the receiver comes short on many features and with it's portability though. I noticed the price of these have already gone down substantially since the holidays, and some retailers have already stopped carrying them. It should be interesting to see if Samsung and XM continuing with this design. Hopefully they will address some issues and create a receiver worth while.",1

2931,"Poor sound quality destroys a good idea. I bought the wireless base with 5 handsets to replace a VTEC 2.4GHz  setup that was being stepped on by my wireless network.  Quite frankly, I regret it.  Sound quality on the Motorola units is extremely poor...sometimes.  And it is not predictable.  I have tried moving the base unit and even sitting next to the base unit when the sound quality is poor and there is little correlation to distance from the base.  The range is vastly inferior to the VTEC 2.4 GHz units.  I can talk on the VTECHs up to 400 ft away from the base and I can't even use the Motorolas in the next room.  It's too bad because Motorola did a good job with the features and functions.  I especially like the blinking light on each hand unit to notify of a waiting message.  The ability to have a local and global phone book is also a very good feature.  Despite the good choice of features, what good is a phone that breaks up and clicks while in use?  Don't buy these unit",1

I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks.-In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away.-It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately!I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key",1

2941,"Don't buy the Audiovox D1750T, it WILL break!. Hello, this is my first Amazon review, actually my first anywhere review.  I normally depend on reading reviews but was never so affected by a product, positive or negative, that I felt a need to write a review.  My experience with Audiovox's D1750T DVD player has changed that.I'll put it as plainly as this:  If you buy this product, it WILL break.  That is a fact.That says it all, and the rest may get long winded, but read on if you want to know how/why it will break.  I purchased this product 6 months ago.  After 2 months the hinge on the battery that allows you to set the unit on a tabletop and watch hands-free broke.  I thought it was a fluke but was able to get a replacement.  Now my second battery has broken in the exact same place, the exact same way, and that's after the fact that I did my best to handle the unit with the utmost care, since I thought it might have been my fault the first time.It is now clear to me that this is a manufacturing error, one in fact that Audiovox's Customer Service representative acknowledged yet refused to do anything about since I was outside the 90 days warranty.  Unfortunately I've only found one other person online who's written about it (epinions.com) but that's out of maybe 6 total reviews I've found anywhere online.The player gets 2 stars from me because battery issues aside, it's a decent player at a decent price.  The resolution and sound without headphones leave something to be desired, but if you can pick it up for $200 or less it would be a good player as far as screen size and general quality goes.  But this battery issue and subsequent customer service issue is unacceptable.  People need to be warned when they're buying something that is flawed in its manufacturing and will break.Another warning is that the paint(?) or whatever it is that makes the sides of the unit black has started to flake so now the unit's good looking design is marred.... insult to injury I tell ya!  Bottom line, I say don't buy it, but if you'll be using it in such a way that you won't use the battery's stand (btw, there's a stand that flips off the back if you're using the unit with external power.  I've never had a use for it.), then I guess it's a decent player.  I'll bet there's better ones out there for the money though.P.S. I finally managed to strongarm a higher-up at Audiovox into replacing the battery for free.... this time.  Fingers crossed THIS one doesn't break too...",1
2942,"Annoying and Frustrating...Not What I expected from HP. I started my own business and purchased this item because of my past experiences with HP laser jets.  One year later, I'm about to throw it out the window and buy a new printer.Why?  First of all, even when printing in black and white, the device uses color ink.  Approximately 97% of my printing is black and white, yet the color ink cartridge levels are consistently depleted.  As a result, I have to purchase (what a surprise) HP color inks even though I don't ever use them.  I estimate that's cost me about $150-200 over the last year.The second reason I despise this machine relates to its annoying warning message pop-up boxes.  When ink is running low in any cartridge, a pop-up appears.  They cannot be disabled.  They appear until the ink cartridge is completely empty.  Since the machine depletes color inks at such minute levels, these messages can appear for days (or until you replace it with another expensive HP ink cartridge).Lastly, the machine will not operate if any of the ink cartridges are empty.  I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to print a simple black and white document but could not because the machine was out of pink or yellow ink.Clearly HP has decided that the best way to make money is through ink sales.  If they'd focused more on the customer's ultimate experience, they'd have secured me as a repeat, long-term customer",1

2948,"Too quirky. After purchasing these earbuds for a bargain price a few days ago, I was ecstatic with the initial quality I heard from the tracks I was playing on my Zen, but for all the package's hype (including a tag proclaiming some kind of award the earbuds had won in 2004) the Philips Surround Sound Earbuds aren't all they're cracked up to be.  After the somewhat promising initial tests, it took me only a couple more uses to realize that the EQ and frequency response on these puppies was way out of whack to say the least.  The product specs on the package claimed the earbuds to have a maximum frequency pick-up of 22kHz, which is interesting considering the human ear can only hear to just below that level.  So, theoretically these earbuds can deliver any and all sound the media dishes out, right?Not only did I notice significant attenuation on the higher frequencies when the volume of my Zen was turned up barely past the halfway mark, but also a complete domineering of the low-end sounds in whatever media happened to be playing.  Just try playing some ambient music with these things to get an idea of the frustration I felt trying to enjoy some relaxing vibes amidst all the jarring distortion and ringing I was hearing.  There doesn't seem to be a feasible solution to this, either, as the earbuds seemed completely oblivious to my efforts of adjusting the EQ output on my player.  Additionally, the assymetrical cord design seems a bit of a silly concept considering the undue amount of pull and tug it places on the left earbud, causing it to fall out a little too easily.  Ranting aside, though, those of you seeking out something better than the stock earbuds your portable music player has provided you with should probably keep searching",1

2952,"When It Works, It's the Best Available Tape Adapter.  But... I've read many of the reviews of the sorely disappointed, and I understand their complaints since I've also experienced many of the same problems.  There are, however, some workarounds that might help some of the stuckees...Regarding too-high-gain leading to static, I've learned through trial and error that the not-so-SmartDeck volume is fairly random due to variations in mechanical position of its head relative to the tape deck head.  If  the volume is set too high (or low), try plugging the SmartDeck in and out a few times, or reach your finger in and see if you can jiggle its position.  Picking an especially loud song while you do this will help you to know when you have successfully adjusted to a good volume.  Unfortunately, this workaround doesn't work for all iPods... although I can always successfully find a good position with my 4th generation 40GB iPod, I've noticed that the output from the iPod mini is significantly louder, and therefore, much harder to adjust this way.Regarding the tapedeck-spits-out-SmartDeck problem, I've noticed that I only get this problem when the SmartDeck is cold, usually first thing in the morning (clearly, this is the tape deck thinking the SmartDeck is a jammed tape).  Try warming the SmartDeck by blowing warm breath into the hole where the fake ""tape"" is, then put it back in.  In cold weather, the deck itself is also going to be cold, so you may have to do this several times until the entire car warms up.  It seems to me that this problem has become less pronounced over time -- I rarely have to do this more than once nowadays.Unfortunately, I don't have a workaround for the intermittent track-skip/FF problem.  I have seen that once or twice, though in general, that feature tends to work for me (both track skip, and track FF/Rewind).  I have a suspicion that this is another cold weather problem and a side effect of the spits-out-tape problem, but now that I have a workaround for the latter problem, I've not seen this problem in over a year.Ironically, if you manage to avoid all these warts, the SmartDeck is the best-sounding adapter I've ever heard.  Plus, the auto-on/off feature is much more valuable than you might think (and no one seems to complain that this feature is broken). With the four other adapters I've tried -- two cassette, and two FM transmitter -- I cannot tell you how many times I forgot to turn my iPod off when I exited the car, then came back to a dead iPod.  Nevertheless, the warts are pretty obnoxious, therefore I must deduct 3 stars from this otherwise 5-star product",1

2965,"Decent, but not as advertised on Amazon.com. Pros:  solid construction, good feel, excellent sound quality, works with power outCons:  keypad isn't backlit, caller ID isn't backlit (contradicts advertising as of 9/19/2004!), if on table then caller ID visible only when looking down at phoneNeutral:  caller ID and programmable buttons (3 of them) dependent on 3 AA batteriesI've been on a quest for the perfect corded phone.  I wanted something with a cord so that there's at least one working phone in the event of a power outage, and I wanted caller ID since I enjoy knowing who I'm going to be stuck talking to when I pick up the phone.  One of my requirements for caller ID is that it have a backlit display so I wouldn't have to turn on the light in the middle of the night if I got a call.  I tried the AT&T 210 trimline paired up with the GE 29096 caller ID box, but that didn't work well since the box wasn't backlit and it kept clicking on the line as if it were trying to flash it.So you can imagine my delight after having read the specs on the AT&T 240 corded phone.  According to the information on Amazon.com, it had the trimline profile that I like, a heavier weight to the handset so it doesn't feel flimsy, and a backlit caller ID unit built into the back of the handset.  Plus, it was inexpensive.  I bought one immediately.  When I unboxed it, I was happy with the weight and design of the phone, even though it doesn't have a backlit keypad like the trimline phones of old do, like the AT&T 210 that I was using.  A pity, since that's a nice feature and one for which I would have been glad to pay more.So anyway, I hooked it up and tested it out.  The phone had a good feel to it, comfortable to hold as well as cradle between ear and shoulder.  The quality of the sound was excellent, both clear and without the tinny sound that can result from the audio compression in cordless phones.  I only had one complaint, but it was a major one:  the caller ID wasn't backlit.  Moreover, there was nothing in the instruction manual indicating that it was supposed to be, either.  This was a big gripe since the real feature of this phone for me was the backlit caller ID that Amazon.com advertises.A possible problem for others considering the 240 as a telephone would be the orientation of the caller ID window.  As it's on the top of the handset, you have to be looking down at the phone if you decide to rest it on a table or nightstand, i.e., there is no accessory to clip on the back to give it an angled elevation nor, due to the location and style of the rubber feet, can an impromptu one be constructed.  This essentially means that if you rest the phone on a table then the caller ID window is viewable only if you stand up, lean over, or pick up the entire phone along with the base and look at it.  Of course, if you don't care who's calling then you can pick up the phone and just take your chances; to me, however, this defeats my main reason for caller ID -- not having to talk to people I don't want to.  If you just use it as a phonebook of recent callers, then this isn't a problem.  Also, if you wall mount the telephone then this isn't an issue at all.  I use this telephone in my bedroom but have it wall-mounted next to the bed so I can see the caller ID just fine...in the light, that is.So, in conclusion, the AT&T 240 is a corded phone with great sound quality and a good feel to it.  I wish that the keypad were backlit and I'm quite unhappy that the caller ID window isn't backlit.  This is a good corded phone that, with a longer cord, could be a great wall-mounted kitchen phone.  I would not recommend it for a location where the lights may be out or the area could be dimly lit.  I am presently using it for a bedroom phone, but if I find another corded phone in a trimline model that has a real backlit caller ID then I will probably switch and move this phone to the kitchen or in a spare drawer for storage.",1

2971,"Basic functions OK, put caution on PS/2 ports. I acquired this unit about a week ago to serve as a docking station for a new laptop computer that does not have any of the traditional ports on it.  You must install the software that comes with it to use the serial or parallel ports, and I had to reboot my computer to get the parallel port working.  (Note that the serial port appears on a non-standard setting, mine is COM4, so any software must be directed to that location.)  I have not tried the serial port, but the USB and parallel ports appear to work fine.  However, beware that the PS/2 ports on the unit do not work the same way as built-in PS/2 ports.  A keyboard and mouse plugged into them will perform their basic functions. But, if you have an advanced mouse or keyboard with extra keys or other options, they will not function through the docking station.  It appears that the PS/2 ports on the docking station are wired to always appear to the operating system as some form of generic Human Interface Device mouse and keyboard, rather than recognizing whatever form of keyboard is plugged in -- as happens with built-in PS/2 ports.  Because of that, I could not find a way to get the computer to match the special mouse and keyboard drivers required for the advanced functions to those devices when connected to the docking station.  Kensington support ignored my first two requests for help on this issue, and then suggested I contact the keyboard and mouse vendors -- which does not make any sense because the devices work fine any time except when they are connected through the PS/2 ports on the docking station. I had to find another way to bridge my keyboard and mouse into a USB port to get them to work.  For that reason, I probably would not have purchased this unit if I had known about this issue.  However, if  you only need a parallel and serial port, as well as two USB ports, this unit will work fine.",1

2974,"SONY = Stops Operating Next Year. This unit looks nice and plays nice, until it doesn't anymore.This piece of crap worked for only 3 months and was turned on about 10x only, as it stood in my bedroom where I only seldom listen to music. It went dead all of a sudden, and Sony doesn't honor the limited warranty !!Apparently, what I have (a short circuit, that prevents me from turning the unit on) is a common defect and it's even MENTIONED in the owner's manual (ie if you get standy flashing, you're in trouble!).I had several bad experiences with Sony, this will be my last. My advice is stay with Panasonics, they're way way way better.",1
2975,"Great for women... but what about men?. Prior to my Zen V Plus, I had a Creative MuVo TX FM which came with an armband and belt clip in the box. It was a very comfortable and easy to use until it was stolen. As a replacement, I thought I would upgrade to the Zen. Unfortunately the armband for the Zen V Plus had to be purchased separately; I chose to go with the Creative branded band based on my previous experience. To my surprise, the Creative armband is too small for me. Now, I'm 6'2"", but I'm not much of a weight lifter, so my biceps are only 14"". However, the available strap length is less than that, so I cannot get a comfortable fit. It fits too tightly and tends to pops open as I try to secure it due to lack of slack.  I looked online and found that the average male bicep is 13"" in circumference - about the same as the armband's strap. As previous reviewers have stated, the included silicon skin is nice, but it seems that this unit was designed for women, children, and smaller than average men. So guys, unless you have a 12"" bicep or smaller, I would look elsewhere for an armband to use while you work out",1
2976,"doesn't work, tech support not good, manual not good. i just received this unit yesterday to serve as a bridge to my Belkin wireless router (the router manual specifies this AP).  Cannot get it to talk wirelessly to the Belkin router. I've spent a good deal of time with it including 30 minutes with Belkin tech support, which consisted of someone reading a script to me, arguing about trivial things, and then ringing off before the issue was resolved. Frustrating to say the least. I'm also not impressed with the lack of logging, as well as the wide-open browser access (your SSID and security settings are displayed to anyone without logging in).The manual is sadly out of date and does not match the firmware nor the physical product, which would make setup difficult for an inexperienced user. Belkin would like to have us believe that this is a plug and play product, but this is not the case.generally, this is pretty much a piece of cr*p. I'm tring to get Belkin to RMA it and either replace it or refund. Overall, I'm more impressed with Linksys/Cisco products than Belkin, even in this price range",1
2977,"HP 6310 has awful software. I installed this machine on a home office network via Ethernet.  The install took awhile, and changed registry settings without asking.  Uninstall did NOT restore the system to it's original state; only hours of manual resetting did that.  How many users can restore the registry?Further, the software/drivers do not like the printer turned off or missing.  If you install this on a road laptop, you can expect a program, HPZinw12.exe, to search for the missing printer every 100 seconds or so using all available CPU time.  If you are unlucky enough to be in the middle of a client presentation, the chances are good that you have just lost the job.If you turn off the printer in the office, your office systems will also search for the printer and display an unclosable dialog asking you to switch to an unknown program while using most of their available CPU time. (Please note that 6 hidden dlls are also running at all times.)  This software is totally equivalent to a virus except for duplication.I returned this system and will never buy another HP product",1

2981,"Too Bulky. Not for a Sony Vaio. I bought this case for a Sony Vaio SZ140 after seeing a spotlight review saying that the Vaio would fit perfectly inside. I ended up returning the bag for a refund for two reasons:1. My Vaio (13.3"" screen) was just slightly too big to fit in the case. The case itself is very well padded with thick foam. I probably could have forced it in, but it would definitely have taken some forcing. I'd guess a Macbook would fit better.2. The case itself is just too bulky. I bought it looking for a sleeve that would protect my notebook while carrying it in a backpack or messenger bag. This case is very large for a sleeve and would barely fit in my bags. True, it comes with a shoulder strap, but if you're going to use that you might as well go with a regular-sized bag so you can carry your power cords and other accessories.This case seems to have trouble making up its mind whether it's a sleeve or a regular notebook bag, doing a poor job at either. It's too big for a sleeve and too small for a bag",1

A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the ""Genius"" bar. At that appointment, the ""genius"" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple ""genius"" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut.

This is a great product, as it can record sound, play movies, radio, and play tons of file formats.I highly reccomend this product, especially over the iPod...they are crap compared to this.  The only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts m4p files (songs from iTunes if you purchase music from them) as the iAudio can't read m4a or m4p.  It's easy enough to get a converter, just might cost you a little more money.Outstanding use of my money though....thumbs up",0
3002,"A Winner !. The Philips SHP2500 Headphones sound great...period.  The $20.00 price tag make them even more of a stand-out.  When listening to familiar cd's, right away I noticed rich deep base that wasn't there with my mini phones.  And after about three hours of listening over several nights, the highs became noticeably extended, must be due to a break-in period.I wore these full size phones for about an hour per sitting and never had the urge to take them off to give my ears a rest, they are very comfortable; the earshells toggle up/down to match individual head shape, and the fabric covered earpads can rotate to match ear angle.  Assuming you have the volume down low enough, you can still hear the phone ringing or the door bell.  The line cord volume control is convenient. I gifted a pair of these to a rap music lover and the observation made was that the maxumum volume isn't as loud as the phones these replaced.  I noticed the same difference between these and my mini phones.  This is a good thing for anyone who cares about long term hearing loss.  I was researching expensive earbuds, now I can spend the $400.00 savings on something else.  Thanks Philips",0

The UHF antenna is supposed to plug directly into your tv (I think this assumes your tv was made a long time ago), which wasn't an option with my set, but it turns out I don't need it anyway; channels in the 50s and 60s come in just as well as lower ones.

Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing.

This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.The CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I've never had a problem with D-Link's website (or customer service, while we're on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link's site.Either way...  install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates.Be sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can't go snooping through your stuff.

Although DivX is the best format for recording off of cable TV, remember its 4 GB file-size limitation.

With all the reviews about how easy the Nano scratches, I left the protective film on until I found the right case the next day at CC (they had just received them that day), sorry Amazon but the Nano did come from you.  Anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the Nano itself.  It comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself.  I have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it, but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible, it works great.  It fits snugly in this case, yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. The case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls. I have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all.  The belt clip is sturdy and secure.  The magnetic snap for closing it works great. The case can be closed with headphones attached, but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access. This case is as cool as the Nano itself and I would very highly recommend it. I hope Belkin makes the same case for the new IPOD",0

Had I not seen that I would have returned it.The performance of the unit plus the cost definitely puts it on a 5-star level but the lack of meaningful instructions I dropped it to a 4-star",0
3031,"I'm Impressed!. I am kind of a shortwave junkie, and have a few radios all over the place,I must admit that for the money spent, and the performance and endurance, this little bugger is probably my best buy!  I cannot believe the sound quality or the reception, its phenominal!  I can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where I work!  (Big heavy steel freezers) It is a simple, small no frills, pocket size radio, but it blows away anything in its price range, trust me",0
3032,"Creative Sound quality with some HFE problems. I have used the Zen Micro (6GB) for about 4-5 months now and I am satisfied with the product. There is a lot of storage space to carry all the songs and most importantly the sound quality is excellent. Sound quality has as much to do with the earphones as with the player itself and I am more than satisfied with both. The interface on the player is easy to use and directory structure, etc. is clear. The interface (button) sensitivity is easily adjustable which helps, especially while travelling.On the negative side, the human factor engineering could use some development. I have consistantly found it difficult to access the storage (Data as opposed to music) difficult to access and retrive data from. However, the software controls for loading music on the player is simple and easy to use.All in all, given the excellent sound quality I declare myself a satisfied customer and I may consider another Creative product in the future.",0

3039,"No Complaints Yet. This machine has delivered everything it said it would.  I had a slight bit of difficulty getting it set up to print (according to my husband, it was all me).  Otherwise, the machine has been functioning wonderfully in my busy CPA office during tax season - my busiest time of year.",0
3040,"Great for DVD labeling. I needed a printer capable of printing directly onto DVDs because LightScribe can not create ADA-compliant labels, and DVDs with paper labels often ""skip"" and play incorrectly.Only Epson makes printers that can print directly onto DVDs, and the R-260 is their current lowest-end product with this capability.  Indeed, this printer is so low end that ink refill packages cost about three dollars more than the printer (which comes complete with ink).  Hence, this is probably the first high resolution ""disposable"" printer on the market.Speed - a couple of minutes per DVD.  Basically, it's about the same speed as any low-end high resolution printer printing a 5x7 photo.  This is about eight times faster than a LightScribe.Quality - great!  It blows away anything I could do with a felt tip pen or a LightScribe.Cost  - TBD.  I've printed seven full color disks with zero defects, and my ink refill icons indicate full reservoirs.  Don't use the ""highest"" quality print setting (there are only two settings).  It drinks more ink, and the normal setting produces great results.  These are DVD labels after all and not something I'm hanging on a wall.Setup - The multi-lingual instructions were clear, and setup was simple (Windows XP).  You'll need your own USB cable, so read the box to be sure you have (or buy) the right kind.Ease of use:  move a lever down, place DVD into DVD tray, place DVD tray into the printer and align arrows.  Print from label program (included with printer).Label program:  very simple to use compared to competing products.  I would not hesitate recommending it to an eight-year-old.  One happy surprise, I can paste screen shots directly onto the label template.  On the other hand, the software has no database merge capabilities.  As a result disk customization with customer names, serial numbers, or product keys becomes a manual task.  That is, you'll need to update the disk label yourself prior to printing each unique disk.  I never used that feature anyway",0
3041,"Wonderful phone. I've been wanting a phone like this for years and finally decided to splurge and buy it. I couldn't be more happy with it. It's a hefty, solid phone and the sound is clear as a bell. It's extremely attractive and I recommend it to anyone who likes retro items that work well.",0
3042,"A very easy connection. This product works very well in a number of situations. Like others, I had a cat5 cable running from my router to another computer across the ceiling, and for aesthetic reasons it had to change. Previous versions and similar products by other manufacturers were not reviewed well, but this unit worked like a charm. Installation took less than five minutes, and the speed, while not as fast as a direct connection is more than adequate, usually above 40 MBPS. While I miss the direct connection when I am grabbing large files, even for video tasks it works well.And what price can one put on no longer getting complaints about a cable looks hanging over the door",0

3046,"AT-PL120. Overall, the AT-PL120 performs quite well.  The flexibility and control this unit offers make it a good value for DJ's and avid music listeners alike.  It is easy to set up and performs respectfully.  The AT-PL120 has a built-in switchable power adapter for different AC voltages and has a built-in switchable pre-amp to make connections to the amp simple and easy.  Good speed adjustments and the AT-PL120 will play the 33 1/3, 45 and 78 rpm vinyl. I found the 78 speed nice since I use it to play some very old 78s.  The unit easily accepts both my mono 78 cartridge and my stereo cartridge. Two improvements I would like to have on this turntable are: 1) Auto reject at the end of the record (a reject button for operator control would be nice) and, 2) I would like to have had a higher quality cartridge included with the unit although the one supplied was adequate",0
3047,"A Good Little (Outdated) Chartplotter. I am happy with this chartplotter but right now I wouldn't recommend it. For one thing Garmin nickels and dimes you to death if you want to actually use this. The memory is very expensive and proprietary. You need to buy additional memory to download any charts into this device. And the charts are VERY expensive and come with all kinds of obnoxious copy protection. Also worth mentioning is that the screen is hard to read in broad daylight. But the deciding factor is that Garmin is just now rolling out their next generation units that will replace this one. I would wait the few weeks it will take to get one of the new ones which will use standard SD memory and provide bigger, brighter screens, etc.",0
3048,"Pocket-sized style. I own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds. I have to say that the only way to improve upon this product, other than offering more color combinations, would be to make it bulletproof, which it damn near is already. A wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory. Although $15 might come across as steep for such a small product, the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds. The $100+ Shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected. The Sendstation Earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it's category",0
3049,"Good for over 2 years. I bought this phone used, on eBay, about 2 1/2 years ago. I did a lot of reading before I bought it and found that there is a known issue with battery life of the handsets. For everyone that has mentioned battery life, there is a solution.When I bought the phone, the station with 2 handsets was $60 on eBay. I immediately ordered 2 Energizer ER-P511 NiMH batteries to replace the Panasonic throw aways. I had the battery life problem with my previous Panasonic phone set, but, this set never dies! My family has talked for hours on a single charge and left the handset in a few interesting places, only to be found again with the paging system and plenty of battery life. At 2 hours of talk time, it still shows two bars.The voice quality is not the best, but, it's not bad either. I use Vonage and no one can tell that I'm not on a traditional line. It's definately better than any of the 2.4 GHz phones out there.The range is more than I need so I can't complain about it. I can go to the corner of my back yard on the opposite side of the house from the base station and experience minimal static. I've gone so far as to walk to the end of our street (a cul de sac) and still had enough coverage to carry a conversation, although it was a weak signal at that point.Overall, I would have given the phone 5 stars if I didn't have to provide my own batteries to make it useable.",0
3050,"The best wireless router money can buy (if you ask me). The range on this thing is amazing. The ease of setup and use is great. The design is great. I wish I could be more detailed here, but it's just great all-around. Nothing more to say than that. If you have an Apple computer and need a wireless router, this should be the only one you buy.

3055,"Don't Be Fooled by it's Size or the Brand Name. When I started looking for an mp3 player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level. The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I  didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects:-Superb sound quality, especially from something that weighs under 8 oz. (I am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable)-Rugged all metal construction and overall great feel-Simple design and intuitive joystick/buttons (I found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes; converts from the iPod may take some getting used to)-A plethera of options: mach3 bass, surround sound, pan, wallpaper, 5 band equalizer, fm radio, voice recorder, surround sound and MP enhance-The ability to play video-A 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time-Very powerful, I normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it-Priced about the same as equal or lesser mp3 players-Extremely easy program to use for transferring ANY type of file to the iAudio. It is a drag and drop system; it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music.-Everything you need is included in the box - earphones, usb 2.0 transfer cable, another cable, a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player, charger and jetshell software-Great storage space (20 GB) which can be used to store much more than mp3sThere are some negative attributes to the iAudio X5 however:-The most glaring problem I had was with the in-ear headphones; they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable. They also have an assymetrical length cord. I consider myself to have average size ear canals so I imagine this is a major problem for other users. I suggest Cowon completely redesigns these.-Because the brand is widely unknown, the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews.-No place online to buy mp3s particulary for this player (however I read somewhere that there would soon be one just like iTunes.)This being my first mp3 player I am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price, because I would rather pay more for the quality. The iAudio X5 is an all around outstanding media player and I believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out. If I were to rate everything that came in the box I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones. Other than that this mp3 player is close to perfect.",0
3056,"watch out where you plug in your laptop. The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling.  I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice.  Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger.

I had doubts about ordering something like this online, but have had no trouble at all, and counting tax, saved $300 over the Best Buy advertised sale price.

It works GREAT with broadband, and doesn't slow down even if you're downloading a lot of files, or playing online games.My only gripe is with the Vonage rebates, which are terrible.  Put simply, Vonage doesn't pay.  Once they've got you signed up what are you going to do?  It's too little money to switch, and so you won't... but you'll be out $50 or $100.

Simply go to the Logitech site, sign up and plug in your new remote (also have your old remotes nearby.)  DO NOT USE THE CD!!!At first, I put in the CD, followed the instructions...  and the next thing I know I am installing the software over a dozen times!  I was directed to install the new version, deleting and uninstalling the old ones, reinstalling the program and some desktop manager thing, and on and on.Finally I uninstalled everything and just went to the website, installed the ONE remote manager program and I was on my way to programming the remote.  Half an hour later I had almost all of the kinks worked out (still a couple buttons that need to be 'learned'.)I am running the following off of this remote:Syntax Olevia LT32HVM 32"" LCD TV (haven't found the ""source"" or ""enter"" buttons yet, but will have to teach new remote)Sony STR-K740P A/V receiver (a few buttons needed to be 'learned')Philips DVP642 DVD Player (a couple buttons needed to be 'learned')Switching from ""Watch TV"" to ""Watch DVD"" is awesome and quite fluid.  Takes about 10 seconds to do all of the macros I have it performing, but with some tweaking I can get that down to just a few seconds.Button response time is very good.Agree with the other reviewers about the ""activity"" buttons at the top: you can't read them in the dark, even though they are backlit.  You'll have to memorize them or customize them to be on-screen functions.Good weight, good feel.  Most used button (Channel +-) is right by your thumb, along with the joystick-disc thing.You don't have to have it poited directly at the devices you are operating -- it can be pointed at the ceiling and still work.I knocked off a star for the nightmare I had with the CD programs and website not talking.  JUST SKIP THE CD and go directly to the website.Oh, and don't forget to install the changes you make -- it's a bit of a small, tricky button you have to press on the main menu of the program.  The data and macros are not sent to the remote live, you must create your activities and then the program will send it to the remote at one time.I recommend the remote, but I also feel that I could live without it.

3087,"Excellent printer -. I've been an Epson printer girl up until now.  I began with the 1270, which was a terrific printer, lasted forever, did a great job, etc.  It finally died of old age and I purchased the 1280.  It was temperamental, sucked up ink big time, and just was not as good as the 1270.  It died an early death, barely a year old.  I was tired of the ink problems with the Epsons, so I did a great deal of research on larger-format printers, and finally decided on the HP 8750.  I was influenced by the fact that the little HP PSC 750 I have owned for more than 6 years is just a terrific, sturdy, quality printer (and scanner and copier).  I've been working with the 8750 since end of December, and so far I'm very impressed with it.  The quality is excellent, operation is pretty straight-forward, it doesn't end up with dried ink supply like the Epson's are prone to do.  The 8750 produces beautiful 11X14 prints - I'm just delighted with it.

3090,"Nice . . . Really Nice!. Ok, if you have two monitors side by side, or a single wide-screen format, this is the way to go!  I use this tablet with the Mac G5, with full functionality, and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen.  I have used the smaller tablets from Wacom, and they work very well, but this particular product is designed and constructed VERY WELL and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use!Having the assignable ""ExpressKeys"" left and or right is really slick for repetitivetasks.This model stands 5/8"" high/thick, 10 and 7/8"" deep (front to back), and just under 16 and 1/2"" wide.  Take two late model white Mac keyboards and set them one behind the other, and that is about the footprint this item covers, (width and depth).So, you will need some desk space, or I have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen.  Quite comfortable!In any scenario, this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use.Thanks Wacom",0
3091,"Solid!. I already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers. The speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled.The mounts are solid, and can be oriented in any direction easily. I am about to by three more for my center, and two fronts.I highly recommend",0
3092,"Well designed; not perfect, but very good. I bought the manual select FM transmitter for my brother and I liked it, so I bought this one for myself.  True, in heavy traffic congestion (I live in Chicago)the static is not cool, but I don't see how Monster could get around that.  I find that the  auto scanning feature works quite well, despite other reviews.  I'm happy with this product and was able to find it for about $70.",0

Instead of paying 300 to install an ipod controller in my car I used the DLO ipod car charger because it is small, with the iClick Leave it insidee the armrest between the front seats and the control is all I need or under 50 dollars.

Once I converted our library, I discovered how easily it works with a new mini-dvd camcorder. I pop the mini dvd in a DVD player hooked to the product and can now combine several mini DVD's onto one large DVD, I can perform simple edit functions and add a music soundtrack from my iPod too!  I have an iPod and optional cord to show video / slideshow on TV -- instead, I run it to this product and make slideshows with music soundtract on DVD.  Sure I could do all this on a computer, but why fiddle with software and the like when this machine does it all!  DVD -- VHS -- iPod -- camcorder all run to this product fabulously and the DVDs it makes work in everyone's DVD player.  LOVE IT",0
3098,"for desktop. I bought these to attach to my laptop and sit on my desktop, small size was important. The fractional watt headphone amplifier in the laptop is enough to push these to reasonable volume. A visit to radio shack and some quick soldering produced a cable. Not exactly hi-fi, but better than the 1 1/2 inch speakers in the laptop. The real use is listening to radio web streams while I work, and playback of my ripped CD collection",0

In addition to the audio paramters, we wanted these speakers to be a white color to blend in with the wall paint.  We have been very pleased with their performance and appearance.  To obtain the positioning we desired, I had to re-form the wall brackets so that the speaker would be aimed down towards our seating position (previous location was above ear level).  This was relatively easy to do with a vice and a hammer.  Aiming left and right is a built in feature of the mount.",0

3102,"Best CD/DVD envelopes out there. I've tried more types of CD and DVD storage devices and techniques than I'd care to admit, and these envelopes are the best.  The capability of holding more than one disk is great, but the capper is the flap that holds a label (provided) with the disk title.When they're stored in a simple box such as Fellowes' own fake-leather ""CD Box"" (great, but very hard to find) you can store an INCREDIBLE number of disks in a small space and it's easy to riffle through the titles because you can flip the label flaps easily without removing the envelopes from the box.I challenge anyone to find a more compact method of storing disks",0

3106,"These are, by far, the best earbuds I have ever owned. If you are looking for a fairly inexpensive pair of earbuds to replace the crappy ""stock"" earbuds you have, buy these.The packaging says ""surround sound,"" and boy, is it right. To test it, listen to a song that switches from front-rear and left-right a lot (I recommend The Beatles' ""Revolution 9""), and you will be astounded by how amazing it sounds. It's like sitting in a spherical room surrounded by 360 degrees of speakers. It's amazing what that little external speaker can do... Cover it up with your finger, and it's like switching back to a cassette tape! That being said, I feel like if it's windy, you won't be able to hear your music at all because of wind blowing straight through into your ear. But, I haven't tested it in the wind yet.And the quality? It's the best quality that you will ever get from earbuds (for less than 40 dollars, at least). They sit comfortably in the ears, although I do have to put them in pretty hard. Also, if you have a monstrously large ear canal, a larger ""tip"" is included.There are a few oddities, however. The main one is, perhaps, that these earbuds are too powerful for their own good. On my iPod, I have to have the volume down at just a sliver to have it be at a reasonable level. I also had to turn my Wave volume way down on my computer. On the other hand, if you like blasting your eardrums out, these will be quite useful. Also, I've never been a fan of the different lengths of wire to the left and right earbud. I don't like the wire scraping on the back of my neck. But, I can definitely deal with it being in the front.I saw that many reviewers hated this because of the lack of bass. Come on, they are .25 inch speakers! You're not going to get subwoofer-like bass from them. I tried some Sublime (""Greatest-Hits"") just to test it, and the bass sounds fine. I think a lot of these reviewers are just way too picky...BOTTOM LINE:This is a top-of-the-line pair of earbuds for 20 dollars and I highly recommend it. It won the CES Innovations award in 2004 for a reason",0
3107,"Everything except SACD. Ever since I discovered this player in the summer of 2005, I have been highly impressed with how much it met both my normal and oddball demands.  As a student of Musical Theatre, Opera, Classical vocal and choral literature, and Jazz and Classical piano, DVD-AUDIO capability is of great importance to me because there are a lot of titles especially in the Classical genre available in this format.  One thing that sets this player apart from the other manufacturers' players is Yamaha's CD UpSampling feature.  For those titles which are currently only available on CD and possibly will never be released on DVD-AUDIO and/or SACD, this option converts standard CDs to the quality of DVD-AUDIO.  On the Musical Theatre, Opera, and choral side of things, this player is capable of playing both NTSC (North American) and PAL (European) DVDs on corresponding as well as opposite TVs.  For certain titles in these genres, the North American editions are either four percent slower in tempo and picture movement and flatter in pitch than the European editions due to the method of PAL-to-NTSC conversion used by the distributors of such DVDs, or do not include as many bonus features as their original European counterparts.  Sometimes, it can be the other way around, except the European editions might be four percent faster and sharper and have less bonus material than their original North American counterparts.  On both ends of the spectrum, if the audio pitch is corrected without changing the audio speed to keep the picture and sound in synch, a subaudible breaking-up effect may be noticed as the result of slight artifacts from slightly bending or stretching the pitch in the conversion process.  However, because of this player's bicompatibility with both color systems, I have the freedom to choose and purchase whatever editions are the best.  Although it is not in the manual, this player can be made multi-region compatible including RCE DVDs.  Turn on the DVD player.  Make sure there are no discs loaded.  With the tray open, using its supplied remote control, slowly press 99990.  Wait for the 'Region 0' message to disappear.  Close the tray.  In conclusion, if you are looking for a DVD player with wide compatibility, you have come to the right place",0
3108,very handy. I purchased this swivel stand for my TV in the bedroom.  It is nice when I need to turn my TV towards my Elliptical machine to watch my shows while I work out.  Very handy and I'm so glad i got it.  Saves the furniture from scratches when moving my TV back & forth,0

However, since the computer recognizes the speaker as a sound card, it would have been better if it also supports mic connection through the remote control just like the head phones.In this case, I would recommend you to change the settings of your sound recording software or chat software to use old sound card during the recording or video calls instead of the ""Default Device"". If you do it so, the software will automatically send and receive sound from your old sound card, in which I assume that a head set (microphone and headphone) is connected.",0

I have to say....I bought 2 of these on a whim in a recent sale.......Suffice to say....I think these could be the MOST IMPRESSIVE Wireless Speakers I have ever owned.....and I've owned them all from 900mhz ones to fancy Sony 2.4ghz ones. All came with a downside of some sort whether it be Hiss, distortion, poor sound quality, low volume....etc. These have none of those problemsWhile 1st testing....I was blasting music on these.......1st in a bathroom.......Zero Hiss.........I was like ""How loud can I make these baby go??"" Suffice to say......very loud (you can definitely crank them up).....They have clear highs, and nice Bass and you can adjust the Treble and Bass.Also...very simple setup....literally plug and play and it supports up to 3 different inputs.I was absolutely amazed by the range of these.....as I was easily beyond 90+ Feet......I walked all over indoors with the remote speaker in my arm (it's not that heavy even with 6C Batteries).....I experienced Zero Distortion or dropouts with no Clicking (that I've experienced in other ""wireless"" speakers"") and this was in fully obstructed 2-3 rooms away.Throw in that the environment contains a wide variety of 2.4Ghz Wireless Products including: 8 set 2.8Ghz phone system, 802.11g Network with a D-Link Range Extender and 2 bridged Routers, Wireless HP Printers, XBOX 360, PS3, Nintendo Wii, Wireless Bridge with VOIP Adapter.....etc.Impressive.....Verrry impressive product. Glad I bought 2.....one for use on my deck....and one for use on patio at beach house.I've seen wireless speakers almost 2 x the price that didn't perform nearly as well as these.The styling is great and the only downside is that they aren't waterproof/weatherproof....then they'd be THE perfect wireless outdoor speaker.

3124,"Best Bang for the Buck. I was cautiously optimistic about this set of speakers after listening to SS-MF650H (a model behind this) at a local Bestbuy store. Listened to it side by side with JBL Venue series and Klipsch. Loved the Klipsch but couldn't justify or convince myself to spend over $800 on a pair and they are huge. Didn't think they sounded 4 times better. The JBL was a little better than the 650 but not that noticeable. So i decided to take a blind leap of faith based on so many positive reviews; remember I only listened to the 650...since that sounded good I figured a higher end will be even better. Man, was a pleasently suprised, it sounded amazing - wow; once again, I am enjoying music in stereo again :)These speakers are a little big, but I love them. I will highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good set of speaker...and you'll have enough left over cash for more additional toys to add to your home theater experience. I have since decided to upgrade my KenWood passive subwoofer to a powered Velodyne. It's like the more good toys you have the more you yearn for better ones.Quick disclaimer; I am not an audiophile, so I am just giving my average Joe ""seat of the pants"" review. I have had these for a little over a month and I am still loving them. Don't know if audiophiles will be settling for these speakers anyway...there are much better (of course expensive) ones out there. Whoever thought Sony only makes good TVs",0

The first movie I played was Primary Colors, and in the begining of the movie there are a lot of reds, (which as most people know reds especially bleed on the screen), but not when using component cables.

The only thing I can figure is they're talking about Table Mate I (which I've never tried) or some other brand completely.  I've had the Table Mate II for at least 2 years and use it daily for my laptop and occassionally for eating on.  It certainly can be set perfectly flat.  I wouldn't recommend leaning heavily on it but I rest my hands/arms on my laptop while I type all the time (like now) without a problem.  It has held up superbly to my abuse.

They are incredibly THICK for audio cables.  If you're imagining something the thickness of the typical headphone or PC-speaker wire, you're in the wrong ballpark:  This is closer to the thickness of a power-strip wire.  It's massive... nay, monstrous.  The wire is still very supple and easy to manipulate.  However, if you plan to run it across your living room floor, it will be extremely conspicuous.  Although you could certainly use it as a permanent connection, its massive construction suggests that the intended use is probably in a setting where you will be frequently connecting and disconnecting, packing and unpacking, and generally giving the cord heavy use.  It looks like it will take this kind of abuse fairly well.  The end",0

3137,"MTX 10-inch 200 watt subwoofer. MTX 10 Inch SubwooferThis product is a 10-inch MTX dual coil subwoofer, which has a 200-watt RMS.  On the new style MTX road thunder subwoofers there is a black carbon fiber-look with a bright red color on the subwoofers cone.  It has a dual coil instead of a single coil, which makes it more durable and able to give the owner that extra sound that they are looking for.I have owned and listened to over twenty different brands of subwoofers, such as Polk Audio, Pioneer, Bazooka, Audiobahn, Sony Xplode, and Kenwood.  Of all those different brands of subwoofers, none compares to the MTX.  Not only do they sound great but they are made as if they are bulletproof.  My MTX has been put through a lot and they still sound like they are brand new.I have used two different amplifiers with my MTX.  The first amplifier I used was a cheap fifty-dollar 200-watt Optimus amplifier.  I did not like that amplifier because it did not give my subwoofers full power.  I next purchased a 250-watt MTX amplifier and I loved it.  The amplifier is  4-channels with maximum 250 watts.  My two 10-inch MTX with my 250-watt MTX amplifier sounds just like my friend's two 12-inch Bazooka's with a 300-watt Bazooka amplifier.  People have told me they could not tell the difference between my 10-inch and his 12-inch.I looked at the exact same subwoofer in Best Buy and at Circuit City.  At either store each subwoofer would have cost me $79.99.  I really did not want to pay that much so I started looking around and pricing out different brands, but I knew that I really wanted the MTX.  I looked on Ebay, and other audio sites on the Internet.  Finding the exact subwoofers I wanted on Amazon.com was just a fluke.  I am so glad I did because the price on Amazon.com was more then fifty percent cheaper.  I did not hesitate and bought them that day.  I received them the next day by overnight mail. I have had them now for about four months and have absolutely no complaints.  I will not hesitate to buy more car audio equipment on Amazon.com.I recommend the MTX 10-inch dual coil subwoofer, 200-watt RMS, to anyone who enjoys music and loves the extra sound quality from your car stereo.  I also recommend doing business with Amazon.com because it was easy and stress free, and I have absolutely no complaints about the product.",0
3138,"Worth every penny.  One of the best 17"" out there. I attend a military college in Vermont and accordingly have an academic day full of marching, running, etc.  This case held up far better than any leather one that my buddies had, while providing amazing comfort.  Regardless of if using the shoulder strap of holding it by the handle (the two parts combine together very nicely) it is extremely comfortable.  The shape of the case molds to your walking stance better than all of the boxy ones from the other companies.Kensington did a very nice job in making sure the laptop is well protected as well.  My 2400$ 17"" notebook is safely nestled inside in a ""sub bag"" that is paded by which fits nicely into the rest of the carrying case.  Very well made.

The case is large enough to store my laptop, power supply, external mouse, several textbooks, notebooks, ti-89 calculator, pencils/pens, etc at the same time!

First off, I want to say that Amazon had the best price I could find, and this shipped right away and arrived 3 days after ordering, even with 3-5 day shipping.Second, I agree with some comments I have read on this. Sure does feel like you spent a lot of money when a thin piece of plastic arrives that cost you over $50. Unfortunately there is no alternative. To me though, the privacy is worth the price.I bought this so I could have stock charts up on my laptop at work without people being able to see what I was doing (so I wouldn't get in trouble for trading) when they would walk by down the aisle. This works perfect in that sense. I tilt my laptop so it faces me, and when people walk by, the laptop looks to them as though it is off. The screen is black for them except in the little thumb notch spot 3M made so that you can easily remove the screen.I used the plastic tabs that came with to hold it in place, they work well enough... however, I found that I cannot close my laptop with the privacy filter held in, as it flexes in the middle and thus falls out. I can't really imagine a better way for 3M to improve this, except perhaps to make it much more rigid.Some other notes that potential buyers may be wondering...1) It only filters and looks black from side to side, not up and down. If someone is standing over your shoulder, they will have no problem seeing it. It is only when they go to an angle to the side that it will block. So horizontal blocking, but not vertical.2) This thing smudges easily! Expect lots of dust, fingerprints, etc. It wipes off just as easily though with a dry Kleenex.3) 15.4W fits perfectly with my 15 inch widescreen. Perfect fit.4) The tabs that hold it in are small and transparent. They have very sticky material on part of them, and look like a half circle attached to a rectangle.5) This filter does not reduce glare in my opinion.Overall, this was well worth the cost of privacy for me. No one can tell my PC is on even though my screen is open",0
3142,"Good wireless repeater with caveats... The D-Link DWL-G800 works fine as a repeater once you get it figured out, it's the pathetic and inadequate D-Link documentation that's really the sticking point.This product is advertised as being compatible with the DI-624 AirPlus Xtreme G wireless router/AP and indeed it is...  EXCEPT that you cannot run the DI-624 in Xtreme G mode with the repeater, unless you enjoy dropped signal and having to hard-reset the repeater every five minutes.Here's the quick and dirty if you are using this repeater with the DI-624:1. Log onto the DI-624, go into the Advanced Options and enable the ""Long Preamble"", then disable the Xtreme G options.  Allow the router/AP to reboot.2. The DWL-G800 is then considerably more stable and can be configured with WEP or WPA.3. An aside, if you are using XP with either service pack, know that Microsoft in their infinite wisdom have now included something called ""Wireless Zero Config"" which, so far as I know, can't be disabled or turned off, unless you're using some sort of third party configuration utility.  Briefly, this means that you shouldn't disable the SSID broadcast on either AP if using this Wireless Zero config.  In fact, Microsoft advises against it since the Zero config doesn't allow you to statically enter your SSID.Open question to D-Link: why even purchase the DI-624 in connection with the DWL-G800 if you can't use the Xtreme G with it",0

3146,"A Great LCD Monitor for Gaming!. I've always been a CRT user, thinking that no LCD monitor could give the brightness and clearity that CRT monitors offered, till I took the plung and bought the Samsung 214t, with 21.3 inches of veiwing area and I'm really blown away by this product. From the ease of just taking it out of the box and plugging it in and having it start working with no install problems, to haveing it automaticaly adjusting to the correct resolution for either normal surfing, to flying with the Microsoft Flight Combat Simulator 3, this monitor is everything I wanted and then some. It is very bright and clear and you notice the size of the display right away, not to mention all the desk top area you get back with this monitor's slim size and easy to use and adjust stand, not to repeat myself, it really is plug and play! The price is well worth it compared to monitors that are smaller and don't offer the 900:1 contrast this model does. If yu're just moving up or making the change over from CRT to LCD as I did, this is the one to pluck down your hard earned money for. Buy it, you won't be sorry",0
3147,"Perfect replacement to my blown expensive old speakers. My old expensive speakers were shot so I went out and bought what consumer reports said was a great speaker for the money.

3148,"Sherwood RD-6500 Surround Sound Receiver. I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required",0

3151,"Useful, but disposable... The short: Don't buy a pair of these expecting to use them for the next five years, they simply aren't engineered that well (details follow). Buy them if you want a cheap pair of headphones that are easy to carry around, comfortable, block outside noise, and sound great.The long: I've owned two pairs of these headphones over the past few years. My use consists of primarily listening to music. I'm not throwing them in a book bag every day, they usually stay at home by the computer, except for the occasional road trip.The second pair recently broke (to the point where it was not worth repairing), so I decided to take it apart to see if I should purchase a third pair.That said, here's how they fail:1. ) The volume control in the cord breaks, and as a result, one or both of the speakers cuts out intermittently. Eventually, there is no sound at all. This happens consistently.With the first pair, I tried soldering the wires back on--this lasted a few hours, until it broke again. The problem is that the weight of the cord pulls directly on the fragile solder joints--they will inevitably break off, no matter how gentle your daily headphone use is. The only solution is to cut the volume control out of the cord and tape the wires back together (I've done this once for each pair).Unlike the volume control, the cord is properly connected, and requires a great deal of force to remove it (accidentally or intentionally).2. ) The wiring in the headset breaks, and the right speaker works intermittently, then fails. This has not yet happened to my first pair, which I am still using (albeit, in a taped-together state) until I purchase a new set of headphones. I have stopped folding/collapsing it to try and prevent it from failing before I buy a new pair (NOT the same ones, I've decided).In the headband, a curved piece of springy metal is stuck between two pieces of a foam-like material. This metal piece has four holes drilled in it (very poorly), and the wire to the right speaker is woven through these holes. The result is that whenever you fold/collapse the headphones, the wire rubs against the sharp metal edges, and the insulation wears away. Eventually it cuts through the wire (which is actually *taught* at the headphone's extended-most position), and it is not possible to remove and replace the wire without cutting and re-sewing the headband. The wire I removed from the broken pair was worn down to the bare metal in all four locations where it was woven.Despite these engineering oversights (failures?), the headphones last for about a year before modifications/repairs will be required, and the sound is above average (bass is actually pretty decent). They are easy to carry and don't require very much power to get loud.Just don't expect miracles for &lt;$30",0
3152,"Good SD card case for the price. This memory card wallet consists of a stiff plastic outer shell that is stuffed with thick, heavy rubber holders.  The case is heavier than it looks and weighs a couple of ounces.  It will support a lot of weight on it without damaging the cards.There are tiny feet on the bottom that fit into tiny indentations on the top that will allow you to stack two or more cases and they won't slide off of each other as long as you don't bump them.The hinge and the latch strike me as very flimsy, but so far, I've had no major problems.One problem I did have is that the rubber slots grip the cards so tightly that if you're not careful when removing a card you can pop the ""lock"" slider out of the card.  That happened to me, but I was easily able to pop the slider back into the card.  You can quickly and easily develop the technique of handling the cards that will prevent this from happening.It's not high-end but does the job for the money.",0

3160,"great product, great buy. The best!  I have been using add-on portable hard drives since back when they were on 10GB, huge and heavy.  The WD 160GB is almost everything I have always wanted and not yet found before -- they have huge 160B storage and are incredibly small -- three or four of them could fit in the space that other small drives claim.  I suppose the only tradeoff is that for this size and with USB self power, you can't yet get a 9600 drive this big (160GB) and a space so small, but the WD160 drives are as fast as my internal drives and they look fantastic.  I am now own 4 of these and now I can bring huge video libraries with me all in less than the space of a paperback book",0
3161,"DVD Space Saver. I really love the space savings of this storage system, although the 140 disc capacity can be misleading.  The 140 capacity includes 16 slots on the inside surface of the cover (billed for 'easy access' to favorite discs, but also handy for storing a multi-disc set or two). Each of the 31 pages of Pro-sleeve storage has two storage pockets on one side (easily holding a DVD case insert or 2, or with folding, a DVD box liner).  On the other side of each page, there are 4 slots to store discs.  The design works well for keeping a DVD and bonus disc together with its package insert on each half page, with capacity for 62 DVD 2-disc sets using this arrangement.The soft rubbery material of the pages hold the discs snugly.  The two slots on each half-page are of different depths, with one covering most of the disc's surface and the other covering about half. The shallower pockets allow some of the disc label to show, making it easier to see which disc is in which pocket.The binder system allows individual pages to be removed and re-inserted, but the design makes the process cumbersome.  Plastic straps pass through two slots in each page and lock into the binder.  Removal or insertion of a page involves unlocking the system (unsnapping a heavy snap - a potential breakdown area with repeated use) and withdrawing the straps from all of the pages between the lock and the desired page, then reinserting the straps through all of the other pages before locking the system again.  Extra pages are available for purchase in sets of 10, making it a little easier to re-organize contents.  Even though I have packed some of the pockets with layers of inserts, there seems to be room for several more pages in each case.An older version of this case had a space in the handle for a label (allowing multiple storage cases to be marked for range of contents, for example), but the current ones do not.All in all, the system allows for compression of DVDs and packaging in about one fifth of the space",0

However, if you're like me and you've been looking for a reasonably priced option to convert your LP collection to MP3 (or CD I suppose, but why bother with another dying technology???), I can't imagine a better option than this turntable.There is a small amount of assembly required, but once you finish that (2 minutes to assemble, another 2 minutes to calibrate...the belt was a little tricky because I didn't read the assembly directions until I ran into trouble with said belt) and install the Audacity software (and download an MP3 converter if you don't have one already), it's smooth sailing from there.  If your records are in good condition, it's truly as easy as playing the record, cutting the tracks and clicking the export command.If your some of your records are a little worn, though, not to worry...after downloading a few plug-ins for Audicity (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) you will have an easy to use and wonderfully functioning noise reducer which will remove NEARLY ALL cracks, pops, etc without affecting any other aspects of the sound quality of the track you record.For me, this will be a time consuming process (5 down...500 to go), but if you're looking to convert a record collection, I can't imagine a better product.

However, unless you're listening to it on near-audiophile or better quality headphones or speakers, you probably won't be able to tell the difference between the two.And as another reviewer mentioned, you really are only getting 16-bit, 48 khz sound quality, though it handles 24-bit, 192 khz input/output.  It's a similar lie that creative labs marketed about their audigy(1)/extigy sound cards, which I suppose were this product's competition at the time it launched.  And for portability, it really is a bit big to carry around with your laptop.  But for the EAX limitations that reviewer mentioned, that's only going to make a few percentage points worth of difference in cpu load on 3d sound, so who cares ?However, it is well designed and it looks great.  All the jacks, knobs, and buttons are in the right place, and it's got nice blue LED meters in the front--download the product manual from the links above for specifics.  Using headphones with it is really convenient.  They've got usability nailed down with this product.If you use a laptop mostly in one location, this would be a good solution to the built-in sound.  It's also good if you use a desktop at work and want to listen to music without having to go in and open the box up.  For a home desktop, an Audigy 2 Value edition might be a better choice.It would have been nice if Philips designed this device for true 24-bit sound quality, but for the price, it's easy to look past that",0

3203,Works great!. I bought this to use in the NAV system of my 2007 Honda Civic.  It works perfectly with 1 and 2G SD cards - I put 1.77G of MP3s on the 2G card and was able to listen to all of them.  SD cards fit so that the end of the SD is flush with the end of the PCMCIA card.,0
3204,"Great antenna, probably best out there, but still not 100%. I don't have much basis for a comparison, as my only other HD antenna was the unamplified plastic & metal 8"" triangle jobbie that came with my receiver. I researched heavily before settling on the Terk-SP. It works great, but not as perfect as I might of hoped. I live in a major city where every station has an HD version, and I've always been able to get them all, but the signal was typically so weak on some stations, they would constantly cut out on me. Having a strong outdoor antenna has solved that problem almost completely.The cheap indoor antenna I had before picked up all the same channels, but with sporadic connectivity. I was constantly moving it around to improve the weak signal. A real pain.When I got the Terk-SP, the first thing I noticed was that it was pretty light. A plastic cover with plastic backing that even has a pear-shaped picture-hook eyehole on the back for hanging the antenna on the wall. Pretty unique idea. It is an ""amplified"" antenna, but that refers to the design. It doesn't plug into a wall socket or anything or use any extra power.One thing I really like about this antenna is the way it looks... like a square satellite dish. I live in an apartment among a sea of dishes, so the unique Terk-SP really stands out (at 16"", it's about the same size too). The package includes a mounting arm with adjustable bracket. It does NOT include a Grounding Rod or Grounding Block (get both at Radio Shack for $14 and $5 respectively). If you are mounting this antenna outdoors, you WILL need them. Static electricity builds up inside the coax cable (this is true of ALL antennas) and can fry your TV (I discovered this the hard way, accidentally touching the cable with my hand after a few days use and shocking the living daylights out of my thumb!) Your coax antenna cable needs to go from the Terk to a ""mounting block"" that you place on a Grounding Rod that you sink in the ground, then run a second wire from the other side of the block to your TV. This will protect your expensive equipment. If you keep the Terk indoors without mounting it, you probably don't need to ground it, so I don't blame AudioVox for not including them.Reception wise, as a quick test, I disconnected my cheapo antenna to the Terk as soon as it arrived and tuned in my worst station. I saw an immediate 30% signal boost than before on that one station! Great. Unfortunately, don't expect a 30% boost on *every* channel. More than likely, any station you could get before (even really badly), you'll get a good steady signal from with the Terk-SP. But any channel whose signal often drops to 0% for any reason, you're probably not going to get with the Terk because 0 times 30% is still 0. When I first installed the Terk-SP, I even (intermittently) picked up an entirely new (obscure out-of-town) station that I never got before, but for some reason, I haven't been able to pick it up again in weeks.Mounting time took about 45 minutes. Screw the mounting arm to a post or rooftop (brackets/clamps for mounting the Terk to a round post come with it), and the antenna to the arm. Then run your cable inside to your TV. That's it.Short answer: this is a great antenna that should work great as long as you can already receive a *steady* signal (for at least a minute or two) from your local stations. The Terk-SP's flat-face design works best in areas where it can pick up ""reflected"" signals off neighboring buildings and such. I suspect the benefits of the Terk-SP might be lost if you live in the middle of nowhere with no place for signals to bounce off of. Also, HD signals are VERY directional, so it helps not to live in a location where you are surrounded by stations coming at you from different directions. You need to point your antenna in a direction that is ""generally"" the right direction for all stations. It took two people to properly adjust my Terk for best possible reception (""A little to the left. No, the signal was stronger back to the right.""). Positioning options are left/right, tilt and twist (low number stations have taller signals that like an antenna whose face is more *parallel* to the ground). The Terk-SP works great and I highly recommend it, but I don't really know how it compares to other antennas since I've never tried them, but I can tell you I am now getting strong steady signals from stations I received only intermittently before",0
3205,"Great Buy. I had been using the CD player for about a month and liked it so much I went back and bought the 3pak magazines so I could load more of myCDs. I works smoothly and quietly when switching tracks or CDs. I would recommend it highly unless they wanted a higher capacity unit, then try one of the other Pioneer units. They;ve got to be just as good except at a higher price",0
3206,"Easy to use and good quality. We had a similar model at our church which we have had for 10-15 years which finally gave up.

Several comparable projectors are available currently, and I chose this one because of good experience with its previous model (the X1) and slightly better specs.Our initial experiences with this unit have been completely satisfactory. The controls are easy to use, the output is bright and sharp for an audience of around 40 people. I was disappointed, however, to discover that it has only one adjustable leg toward the front of the projector. That leg is used in tilting the projected image upward, but  we had to use found materials to level the unit. Two legs would be better!",0
3209,"COULD USE MORE VOLUME ... BUT. I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound, the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price. Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes, so that means it's great, right",0

3215,"Good system for the price. This is an all inclusive Karaoke Midi based system that plugs into the RCA input of your Audio/visual equipment.Set up is easy.  Navigation through the music is easy and easier when you know which song you would like to select through its index that accompanies the system.Construction is solid.  The background visuals are nice but monotonous.  The text is clear; as well as prompting.  Lead vocals are lead by the prompts as well as the MIDI generated music. Quality of the music is good.The drawback of a system like this is the lack of 'actual vocals'.Songs are expanded by buying cartridges (which are limited to as few as 50 or as many as 200).The rating of your vocals is based upon how you hold the notes in conjunction of the prompts - not the quality of your singing.  A seasoned singer who doesn't follow the prompts can get a 40 whereas a singing hacker can get an 88.All in all, it's worth the time and money for a self contained system that is highly portable and easy to use",0
3216,"Very sturdy. After reading other reviews and noting the product specs, I wasn't expecting a very light bag. Indeed, this is a heavy bag, but the weight is worth it - it's very sturdy and will withstand the horrors I will put it through.The compartments are numerous. I wasn't expecting the number of pockets or zippers, but they've turned out to be an enormous help. Plus, the padding surrounding some of those pockets is very handy, since I tend to carry around a ton of gadgets.In all, it's very heavy but it's a useful bag.",0

The main selling point for me was that there's also a protective plastic layer over the screen that will protect the screen during collisions as well.  Not many (if any) other cases had that.  Plus, you can see the colors through the silicone.  I thought the pink/blue/green iPods were way too bright for my taste, but this case could easily blunt those colors",0

3225,"A Solution That Works. I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.)The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable.The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.",0
3226,"Great product, mediocre software... I was nervous about getting any converter after reading reviews of quite a few of them here. I have never done any video conversion or editing before, and I had about 2 days to transfer an analog videotape and clean it up for a work project.The Plextor installed and ran perfectly under XP with absolutely no problems. Since I had the unit, I also took the opportunity to convert about 15 VHS tapes I had to DVD :) with no problems on any of them, even older ones. Specifically, I had no video or audio sync problems with anything, commercial or non-commercial origin. If I could give a separate rating to hardware, I'd give it a 5 and give the included software a 3.Intervideo's WinDVD comes with the product and is generally usable, but has installation issues, at least one persistant bug even with the current update, and a generally non-intuitive interface (YMMV). Please note that, contrary to common practice, the product serial number contains the letter ""O"" and alphas *must* be in upper case. I couldn't get font size changes on title screens to stick--they looked right on author playback, but reverted to the default (huge) size when the DVD was actually recorded. Otherwise, most basic stuff appears to be there if you click around, and the help isn't bad.Completely met my needs. Thanks to prior reviewers for the info I needed to make my decision",0
3227,"Love it!. I got this for my birthday and it is one of my favorite presents ever!  It is SUPER easy to mount, only took about 10 minutes, if that.

The radio reception is also much better than any other radio in my house as I can get stations on it that I can't on my other radios",0
3228,"Outstanding Range!. I did my research before purchasing this wireless card from Amazon to use in conjunction with my Belkin Pre-N wireless router.  According to every net review I'd read, this combination of Belkin Pre-N desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class, and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router, 'range' is what I needed above all.After some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself, I now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90% range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely (and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not I had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability.)The odd thing about this 'Pre-N' combination from Belkin is that apparently the later Belkin N equipment is grossly inferior, and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model.These cards and the Pre-N router are becoming harder to find as they've been superseded by the newer (inferior) models currently in the stores, so if you have to operate wireless at great distances, I doubt you'll beat these Belkin models for at least the immediate future",0

It has almost everyting that you could ask for from an mp3 player. My main reason in leaning towards this product was the lack of necessity for a special software, and that comuters can read and write to X5 like a regular external hard drive. This, plus the folder/subfolder/file system -which is a much better cataloguing method than mp3 tags- makes finding and navigating tthrough your collection much easier. Especially if you primarily listen to classical music it is a big help, since you may have a folder system such as : Classical/Beethoven/String Quartets/Late Quartets/Op 132/the Lindays/xxx.mp3The sound is very good indeed, I  do not like to use any enhancers such as EQ's or the Jet effects still you hear a robust natural sound.

I use Energizers 2500mAh rechargables in my Kodak 4MP digital camera and I can take over 100 pictures before having to switch to the other set. So let us see, you can charge your 4 AA batteries overnight, take over 200 pictures, then recharge them, cannot see 1 problem with that! If you need to rush pick up Energizers 15-minute charger, but if not this is your best bet",0
3265,"Liked it so much, we bought a 2nd one!. I've had my pair since Christmas and use it everywhere!  We all know the earbuds that come with the ipods are CHEAP!!!  Sort of ridiculous considering you pay so much for the ipods, they could be just a little bit better.  My oem earbuds started giving me problems about 2 weeks into owning my ipod.  These earbuds eliminate white noise and static and rounds out the sound for a crisp, clear sound.  I can have my volume all the way up and my eardrums are not rattling.  I do listen to a lot of bass rich music.We just bought a 2nd one for my husband and felt it was well worth it.  You will always have someone that is unwilling to part with the money and feel that if they do, they are going to find something to complain about.  It's all a part of their vicious buyer's remorse cycle.I use mine at the gym and they play their music pretty loudly, not to mention the sounds from the various machines and weights.  It completely blocks out all of those other sounds so I can concentrate on MI-TUNES :O)The earbud covers do take some adjusting to.  Finding the one that best fits your particular ear is not too difficult considering they provide you with 3 different sizes.Bose Customer service, like the quality of their products, has always been top notch.  I see these on sale for under $80 on a regular basis.Buy it, you'll love it.  (As long as you are not a card carrying member of the 'Buyers Remorse Club'.)",0
3266,"Great product as advertised. I experienced the same problem some other people did when I used this card with my Canon 20D.  The firmware was 3.01 which is not compatible with firmware version 2.03 on the camera.  Seagate responded my email within a reasonable amount of time and I was sent a replacement with version 3.02.  Formating the older one took about 20 minutes; Formating the one with firmware 3.02 took a few seconds.  The speed of the drive is descent if your camera has a large buffer to keep up with the slower speed of the drive when taking multiple shots at the same time.  Before you buy this product know it's limitations and you will make a better choice.  A microdrive has mechanical, therefore moving parts and will eventually fail.  That is just the nature of the drive.  Also, 8GB is a lot of room for a lot of pictures.  If you cherish your pictures, be smart and backup as soon as possible, don't just let them sit in the drive.  I have nothing but good things to say about Seagate.  Follow the procedures and they will always accomodate you.  For their supprt and efforts give Seagate 5 stars.  In summary, 8GB of space for about 150 is a pretty darn good deal even if it breaks eventually.  Just determine the usage you are going to get out of it and decide if it is a cost effective solution for you.",0

NEVER!!people will typically place them in the corner of a room which is fine and you will NEVER have an issue with the rack at all. i have mine set right near the entrance of the bedroom door and i have brushed up against it and bumped elbows with it, and it ever so slightly moved a little but nothing where i was worried about it falling. oh and i have carpet in my room which makes it for a less sturdy foundation.i have even thought about purchasing another one for dvd's.personally speaking i def recommmend this cd rack",0
3269,"Bang For Your Buck!. Well, I needed some new headphones. I tried the UR5 from Koss. The sound quality was alright, but they could BARELY be heard. I found these, thinking Sony, would make headphones with better and louder sound. I was right.The good news is that the sound quality is excellent. Sony headphones always seem to have more punch than other Koss, RCA, Panasonic, and other brands of headphones. The bass and treble are clear, and bass is pretty deep as other $6 headphones I've tried. I would have enjoyed the headphones that came with my player (SLSV570), but they were uncomfortable, and I mean VERY. These are pretty comfortable and lightweight, as the box explains.The bad news is the overall durability of these headphones, which is a big minus. I've been though two of these, yet the third ones haven't broken yet at all (keeping my fingers crossed).The price is very reasonable and very cheap, and I wouldn't have a problem buying another pair, because of their cheapness.Overall, these headphones add a punch to your music, and the volume is loud for those quiet CD players",0

I bought this card to add more USB ports to a Mac G4 AGP (Sawtooth).The two USB ports just aren't enough when you're running Pro Tools and add-ons like a Frontier AlphaTrack, which will not work off a hub -- it needs a dedicated port.The Allegro does the job perfectly and at a price that's comparable with a powered hub",0

3277,"Decent radio, some marketing hype. First, a little about my background.  I am an amateur radio operator (ham radio), and an electrical engineer.  So, I know a little about radios.  I got another car, and decided to put a two-meter mobile and a CB in it.  Since the 2M mobile takes up all available space for mounting a radio, I decided to choose this model as my CB.  I have had it going for a few days now and it seems to work just fine.  The advantages of this model, besides the obvious one of being easier to mount, is that it also includes weather reception, a scan mode, and an actual frequency display (a rarity among normal legal CB's).  About the only bad points that I can see is that the unit itself is somewhat large and looks awkward on my dash, the speaker does not sound fantastic (but not too bad considering the size), the knobs are a little difficult to adjust while still attached to the dash, and the cable is coiled and flexible but it is so thick that you have to really tug on it to get it to extend.  The thing that amazes me is the marketing hype.  The ""soundtracker"" technology is close to useless.  If you power on the radio without and antenna, soundtracker sounds great.  However, if you turn it on with an antenna attached while truckers are talking all over the state, soundtracker does nothing for that type of noise.  The problem is that, with CB, you never really get quiet conditions.  If soundtracker is so great, why even include a button to turn it off?  Why not just leave it on all the time?  Soundtracker also claims to increase the transmission strength.  There is really only one way to transmit at full legal power.  If soundtracker does actually improve transmission, that means that they intentionally crippled transmit when soundtracker is turned off.  So, the whole soundtracker thing smells to me like a bunch of marketing hype.  This is still a good choice for a CB, though, if you cannot mount a regular-sized unit in your vehicle.  Just make sure to get a good antenna.  I chose a Larsen designed for 11-meter usage in an NMO mount.",0

I was having trouble finding this system in stock with other vendors.  But when I shopped at Amazon.com not only did I find it, but the price was amazing and far less expensive than anywhere else",0
3280,"SHN5500--How to USE IT for GREAT RESULTS!. It looks like others who have reviewed this product ""just don't get it.""  And, that's great, because this is causing the price to drop on a VERY FINE product.  They think these are supposed to be BOSE or something.  No, they aren't $300-plus equivalents.  The noise suppression is not exactly the same, true.  But now going at just over $20, what does a rational person expect?  All the same, they have a real charm of their own....First, the comfort is fantastic!  Did the other reviewers use the ear loops right?  I don't think so.  The ear loops really support the unit on your head.  Rotating the entire unit in the ear loops allows for use even on a pillow (certainly enough for airplane useage).  I have BOSE Quiet Comfort II's.  They're great--but in other ways.  I can take these Philips SHN5500's where I wouldn't risk the Bose units...Second, the sound is very clear.  I've got thousands of tapes I recorded years ago from CDs and cassettes with special denoising (DNL) processing.  I don't have time to do all of that all over again, so I prefer (as old-fashioned as it sounds) to use cassettes on airplanes.  Ever fumble and ""discus"" a CD in a plane's tight quarters?  At any rate, my tapes are free of noise, dynamically processed as they are.  So, a decent cassette player introduces a BIT of hiss, yes, but on a PLANE, that's not much.  BUT, to the POINT:  These SHN5500's have a transient quality that is breathtakingly beautiful. They actually limit whatever hiss does come on the tape.  CLARITY.  They'll do great with MP3, but I'm a Classical junkie so I won't be there until a system comes along without the compression.  But, that's a whole other story....Third, I think you should consider snapping up a couple--like I have--before Philips redesigns them to meet the customer's MISCONCEPTIONS and (naturally) makes those people happier with a (then) misconceived product.Fourth, I ASSURE you I have no ties to Philips, etc.  I just think SOMEBODY needed to give credit where it is due.  BTW, I AM a ""technical person"" and have THREE (Research & Development) R&D 100 awards to my name.  I say that just to let you, the reader, know that my analysis is hardly that of an uninformed crank.  I also appreciate that there's at least one other reviewer, here, who gave great technical data and shares some of my thoughts about this really fine product.  $20 does not buy $300 Bose sound.  But on a plane, that $20 is well spent on the Philips SHN5500's.",0
3281,"Grandchild loved it!. I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it",0
3282,"It worked for me... I was able to install and use this product on an HP iPAQ hx2495 without difficulty.  I inserted the SD chip, the software installed and I was able to use it straightaway.

After determining that I had a dodgy SD chip, I was able to back up the chip to a second one for safekeeping.  I use Mac's at home, so getting something I could install without finding a PC was a huge win...I've made two trips so far, and things have worked well.  I connect the iPAQ to the car's sound system (mp3 plug) so that it's more audible.  I've also used it hand-held while settting it up, and it tracked me walking along at 3-4 mph.

3283,"Amazing Sound!. I'm no audio expert, but do love my music. I like to dedicate at least three hours of my day just simply listening to music. So, I thought a hefty investment in high-end earphones would make for a great listening experience. Last year, I bought a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort Noise-Cancelling headphones. Again, I'm no audio expert, but I thought the sound was awesome. I especially loved the bass...deep, rich, and I personally like the fact that you were able to ""feel"" the bass' physical presence. I thought no other headphones/earphones would surpass these headphones' magical sound. WAS I EVER WRONG. I got tired of looking like some weirdo with those HUGE Bose headphones snuggled on my ears constantly. They're just too big! I needed something that was more portable, more aesthetically pleasing to the average on-looker, and that produced excellent sound. I heard of Shure from an old friend of mine. He swore by his pair. He's a DJ, so I took his opinion on Shure with great value. Needless to say, I decided to invest. I was marvelled by the sparkling reviews of the Shure E500PTH. 5 stars is absolutely amazing I thought. This has to be the holy grail of all earphones. I forked out $350 and bought it. Two days later, I received it in the mail. Plugged it into my Creative Zen Vision M...and I was in MUSIC HEAVEN. The sound is...PERFECT. Literally perfect. It isn't tinny, not muddy, not distorted...or anything that compromises one's music listening experience. It's a very balanced sound with ringing highs, rich lows, and CLEAR vocals. It picks up on a lot of pleasant details. I used to hate in-ear phones, but these are amazingly comfortable. You hardly know that they're even there. Again, I'm a bass junkie. While the physical presence (which I know a lot of people dislike) isn't as prominent (in comparison with the Bose), it's still deep, real, and rich. The clear, detailed sound these earphones deliver more than makes up for that physical bass I barely even miss now. I say invest in a pair. You'll LOVE them",0

3285,"NO JOKE. I also installed this unit as a second drive into a Mac G4 and had no problems. Well, I take that back. I had some trouble trying to release the ribbon cable clamp (Novice). After I figured that, it was easy going. Oh it also helps to use the Power Mac G4 Setup Guide that came along with the computer. Under ""Installing Internal Storage Devices"" is written, ""Important: Use the original Apple cables that came with your Macintosh when you install additional ATA drives. Some non-Apple cables may not correctly support cable select mode"". And the screws were long enough.Formatting the new drive for Mac OS took some time (40 min.). But the computer did all the work using a current Macintosh drive setup utility.The drive is up and running and it only took one and a half hours. That includes reopening the computer to secure the cable clamp. I forgot",0

I set it up in a few minutes and can now play iPod movies, tv shows and slideshows through our home entertainment system.

I have never purchased any components from Onkyo before, but a friend of mine more familiar with audio components recommended it.  The price was very reasonable, especially after Amazon recently reduced the price to just over $140.The receiver was shipped from J&R Music World.  The packaging was good, and everything arrived in good shape.  The directions weren't great, but having set up 5.1 systems before, this was not a tremendous hurdle.  Once the unit was turned on, though, the actual setup of the speakers and other features was much simpler and much more effective than the unit I have in my primary home.  It was really a snap to get the speakers configured and balanced.The sound quality is excellent.  I don't have a sub-woofer hooked up yet, but the compensation by the unit is excellent, and the sound quality is still top notch.  It does not have many of the bells and whistles of other units, and it is just a 5.1 system, but if you're looking for a basic unit that provides all of the necessities, good sound quality, and ease of installation, this unit would be an excellent choice",0

It replaced a 36 inch CRT Mitsubishi that had a great picture, but even on standard definition the Panasonic is outstanding. On HD channels the picture is excellent.

3294,"Does a simple job, but does it well... I like the look of my MacBook Pro, and so I keep it (fairly) clean and am very careful with it.  However, the keyboard is one of those problem areas that is hard to clean, particularly on a notebook computer.I looked at several more intrusive (adhesive) scratch-resistant solutions, but I found the ProTouch to be the best option for me.  Because my main focus was keeping the system clean, I wanted to be able to remove it, clean it off, and put it back on, while knowing that whatever dust, gunk, etc., it was collecting wasn't getting into my keys.The ProTouch works fabulously for this purpose.  The silicone is not QUITE transparent, but does a pretty good job of letting the MacBook Pro's color shine through.  Some reviewers have complained that the MBP's keyboard is difficult to see with the cover on in some conditions.  I have no such problems, at least as far as the ProTouch is concerned.  The MBP's keyboard, because its keys are designed to allow light through, will be hard to see in low-light conditions -- this is unavoidable, and not really a fault of the cover.Remember to clean it regularly, though, or oils and such from the ProTouch CAN transfer to the screen.  It's reversible with a good cleaning for the monitor, but still disappointing",0

I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod.No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.",0

I loved my earlier home office version (which lasted 6 years with moderate shredding until a large hidden paperclip did it in) so I'm partial to Fellowes anyway.

Reading one reviewer's post that the cabinet is not solid wood (instead wood veneer over particleboard) boosted my confidence but I still feared the possibility of ending up with a WR-2 with a white but cheesy finish.  Buying things over the internet without touching and handling in person can be risky.  Having recently unboxed my new WHITE WR-2, I am writing to say I am overwhelmingly pleased with my decision; you couldn't pay me to take the wood grain cabinet now.  You would never know the cabinet is wood other than the solid weight and feel of the radio; the finish appears to be a high grade white plastic (presumably with wood underneath).  Absolutely Beautiful!Originally I was shopping for the CC radio (made popular by advertising on Art Bell's program) but after reading reviews that identified problems with the display and memory buttons decided to review all radios I was able to find online (there are hundreds) and pick the best to meet my needs.  I chose the WR-2 because it is fairly unique not having any buttons or knobs on the top or sides and advertised as having decent AM reception (I mostly use my radio bedside and listen for about an hour as I fall asleep at night and only rarely as an alarm clock.

3312,"Excellent cooling fan.....except for... This is a very well made cooling fan for your laptop. However, if you have a 15.4"" screen your laptop will hang off of it about an inch on both sides, 17"" is about an inch and a half on both sides. Is that a problem? No, not really. You want air circulation underneath to cool. The 3 fans are great. Most cooling boards have only 2. An earlier reviewer said he didnt like it because the back was ""open"". Well that reduces the weight and increases air circulation. It is well designed in my opinion. The on/off switch is nice. It will only work of course if the laptop is running. You will never forget to turn it off. It runs amazingly quiet. You cant hear it but you can feel it. It is really meant to keep the battery cool and help the heatsink fan. A cooler working battery will last longer. It has a good angle to work. I really havent found anything wrong with it. I highly recommend this item, however, if I was to make a suggestion to improve it, it would be to add a couple of usb ports to it.",0

3318,"Brief reply to ""  pinxet ""pinxet"" and some comments. I've had this keyboard for a little over a month. I'm a college student and purchased a PPC so that I can carry my notes and important dates, information, etc in my pocket.Typically, a keyboard was, with the intention of using the ppc as a notebook, necessary.The pro's are pretty much as pinxet mentioned, there's not much I can add.However his cons are somewhat... insulting to the intelligence of HP customers. The BT_KB comes with an off button. The same button you use to turn it on turns it off. To further experiment with this, if you press it once, and establish the connection with the Ipaq then press the button a second time a pop-up will appear informing you that the keyboard has been disconnected. Also, if you press the button twice and then have your ipaq search for it, it will not find it.The little lock to keep the keyboard flat is, as pinxet mentioned, useless.the ""/"" button (also ""?"") is curiously placed to the right of the shift (on a normal qwerty keyboard it is to the left of the shift). So if you use the forward-slash or question mark frequently you will have to adjust your writing to get used to the unusual position of the key. (where the ""/"" would normally be for you fingers to type is the up-arrow key. So what ultimately ends up happening, when you want to type a question mark, is you hold down shift, press up, highligh one line of text and continue typing removing that line of text. Fortunately the ipaq word processor comes with an undo function.)My only other concern is that I seem to be having problems connecting the keyboard to my cell phone. The phone identifies the keyboard and establishes a connection, but beyond that I can't seem to get the keyboard to type anything.For students and anyone intending to use the ppc as a PC (perhaps a pocket laptop), this keyboard is priceless. I use it four to five times a day.(and as such, I would highly recommend purchasing two pairs of rechargable batteries for it. Next time maybe HP will have a built in lithium battery, like all other accessories for electronics",0

3329,"Test your wiring as it's being installed with this unit. TRENDware CABLE TESTER 10/100 COAX & TP ( TC-NT2 )I bought one of these testers to verify coax and Cat5e wiring in a house where a structured wiring system was to be installed.  Two Cat5e and two RG6 (coax) cables were run to each room from a centrally located panel, so that's a lot of cable.  As Cat5e cable is fairly fragile (compared to non-metallic 110 volt house wiring), the time to make sure it works just after it's installed. Once the dry-wall is up, you'll have a real problem on your hands if a concealed cable fails.This thing tests for several things.  1) wiring is correct end to end [there's connectivity, the right wire is on each pin, there are no shorts, no wrong cross-overs, etc.), 2) the cable isn't damaged, 3) the connector isn't defective.  Leviton's Installation Manual for Residential Structured Wiring Version 3.0 emphasizes testing as being a fundamental part of a quality job.  The larger the job, the more important testing is.  Even smaller jobs should be tested though, if the wiring will be inaccessible later on.Here's an example of what not to do:  I recently toured a high-end new house featuring ""structured wiring"".  Unfortunately, the builder left many dozens of unterminated RG6 and Cat5e cables dangling about 4' down from the ceiling in the furnace room.  The individual cables had no labels on them and they was no panel to organize those wires.  Shame on him.  Since low-voltage wiring is not included in any county inspection, this builder got away with extremely sloppy practices, and the unwary buyer will be stuck.This tester works as follows.  After installing terminators on each end, plug one end of the cable into the sending unit and the other end into the receiving (remote) unit.  If either end the cable to be tested is terminated with a jack (versus a plug) plug a straight-through patch cable into that jack, and the other end of the patch cable into one of the tester units.  Turn the sending unit on and chose between testing one wire (pin or path) at a time, or set it to auto where it slowly cycles through 8 wires and a ground.  Testing is simplest when the remote unit is in your sight line.  If the remote can't be nearby, use the auto setting and then go to that other end to see what's happening, or have a helper yell back which lights come on.  I recently sent a helper to an attic with a walkie-talkie, with me in the basement, to check out Cat5e wiring.  You can also test multiple cables to/from the same location using a jumper.  E.g., at a bedroom wall plate location, attach the ends of two coax cables together using a double female jack, then concurrently test the two cables, from the Structured Panel end.The sending unit tests the wires in sequence (1 to 8, ground) and then starts over.  For each wire tested, a corresponding red LED on the sender lights.  The unit sends low-voltage current on that wire to light an LED on the remote.  If there is continuity, a red light on the remote comes on.  If you're testing wire 1 and it's received on wire 1 on the remote, the number 1 LED lights.  If it's received on another wire (e.g., wire 2), that LED comes on.  If it's received on multiple wires, they'll all light.  If it's not received at all, no LED's light up.  On auto mode, LED's 1 through 8 wil light at the remote at about one second intervals, assuming it's straight through cabling.This device easily paid for itself during the testing of one renovated house; with 29 RG6 runs and 42 Cat5e runs to various rooms from a Structured Wiring enclosure.  Even though all of the RG6 cables check out OK, there were several Cat5e issues, which I then fixed.  The Trendware tester found one defective Keystone jack, several plugs with crossed wires (my error), and one where a jack was wired correctly, but a wire didn't make contact.To test RG6 coax, you'll need two F Type Female to BNC Male adapters.  You can also purchase USB and Firewire adapters to test those cable types (see customer photos).Since many applications don't use all 8 wires, you could still use a cable successfully, even though some wires in that cable were mis-wired,  shorted, etc.The tester comes in a zipper case, with room for the optional adapters.  It uses one 9 volt battery.Excellent product",0

3339,"Solid well made radio- Improvement over old Grundig line. Hi , I'm Vince the radioman I've have a large collection of radios and I love to do compares and share my thoughts. The Eton E 10 ( along with the E1 and E100) is a vast improvement over to old Grundig line of radios. You can immediatly see and feel the difference in the quality of how the radio is made. It has a robust memory (500 presets) and complete functionality including wide/narrow band selection and an interference filter which seems to work well. The tuner sensativity and dynamic range are very good considering the price . It has an antenna trim feature which is a pleasure and not usually available on a radio of this price range.I enjoy AM DXing and have had good results, not quite as good as the SONY 7600 or the Sangean ATS909. The Sangean is priced way above the E 10 but the SONY 7600 is just a bit more but has SSB which the E 10 does not . The E 10s cosmetic design /sleekness is wonderful and as I've said earlier ...a well made radio!! The control buttons are a bit small and cause issues for those of us with large hands, but not a show stopper. My actual rating here is 4 and a half stars , I do really like this radio but its not a SONY , it does have some hiss and selectivity issues, but none the less a very good buy for the money .",0

3349,"Great system for your office or living room. I needed a small system for my office.  I wanted removable speakers, good sound at all volumes and a sleek look.  This system filled that void.  I searched for about a month to get it, and there is nothing less than fantastic about this system, even the price.In terms of sound, I can understand music at all volume levels (many cheaper systems distort at low levels) and at high volumes it sounds great.  I can't use it at high volumes now that I've taken it to work, but I am thinking about buying another for my living room at home (run the output of my family room stereo and I'll have a system that sounds good in both places for parties).In terms of looks, this system is very cool.  I tried to downplay it by placing it behind my desk, on the shelf where I keep my food, so that people wouldn't question it (because small stereos are allowed but not everyone likes us having them).  Despite my attempts to blend it in, I've received several complements on the way that it looks.  Silver casing and a sleek design are just the basics, this system features a blue backlit display that looks great!I thought that the ""DVD"" option in the stereo meant that you could play MP3s on DVD (a great idea for someone who wants to never have to change CDs), but in fact it meant that the system is a DVD player, and it has a video output to connect to your tv.  That's a nice plus.  I haven't tried the MP3 idea yet, so it may or may not support them.The stock antenna is terrible, but so are most stereo antennas.  I'll buy a new one soon...  The other downside is that you can't switch between presets without the remote (you can change the station, but not using presets).  But with 30 FM presets, I'll never run out!  The only thing that wasn't obvious about the set-up is that the disk buttons (disk 1, disk 2, etc) on the stereo are the eject buttons, not the select buttons like most other stereos.  Overall, this is a great design for a great stereo.  I used to work at a radio station as the engineer and now I wish I had this back then because I could blast music in my office and really utilize the system the way it was meant to..",0

3351,"Sony ECMMS907 is a decent mic. I bought the mic to use with a digital video camera that has an external mic jack.  You know how video cams get lousy audio because the mic is over with the camera and not out with the subjects?  When this mic is out in front the length at its cord (5 ft), it provides great audio.  When I add a 10ft extension, the mic loses quite a bit of its signal so that the audio level I get is about 60% of what it was with the shorter length cord.  Still much better than if I use the mic on the camera.  So maybe you will not try to use a longer cord - the main issue with the mic is that it would be nice if it produced a higher level of audio output so that you get a stronger signal into your recording device, but the sound it gets is nice and clear and it works well for amateur applications",0
3352,"Worth it. After reading a few reviews on the turntable, I decided to buy it anyway. This was more of a gift for my mom, since I would be transferring all her records to CD.

The software itself is pretty straight forward, although mastering it took a few hours. There are some cool options like graphic EQ & the audio restoration which I used on every record. The turntable is by far the best I've ever used. Audio-Technica has made a great package deal with this one. If you need to transfer records to CD, get this & save yourself some money",0

I haven't tried scanning from mine, but in the store the photo scan and the document scan were very, very good.  It was the ease of printing in the store a picture that was on my phone, that convinced me.  I did it with no one there and no manual.

So much so, in fact, that I've been using mine with only a single AA battery in place.My two niggling irritations? The fact that the battery sensor tells only when your batteries are dead or dying is one. But I'll give based on the aforementioned efficiency.

That said, I still had some free memory at the end of my trip, so it's not like my trip was ruined from missing out on 70 photos.  It just seems that the number of photos should be consistent in identical products, and I did not find that to be the case.  Aside from that, they say that this particular card is the best value you can get, and I found it to be efficient, perfectly-sized, and very fast to upload, all at a reasonable price.

The 2300 has external memory so that I can separate items (personal, school, work, etc) and it stores much more than the limited amount of memory on the 330.It has a nice size that is thin and fits into your pocket.  The memory life also seems to be pretty good on this.  As I had read on other reviews, the placement of the buttons might be a tad tricky, but so far no problems.My one complaint is that this recorder did *not* come with a case/pouch like the 330.  I went to the Olympus site and they offer one to European customers, but not U.S.Other than this drawback and the price, I am pleased on upgrading to the 2300",0
3372,"Amazing Batteries!. I've used a number of types of rechargeable batteries from various companies in the past. I bought these batteries to power my Olympus FL50 flash for my DSLR camera. Other rechargeable AA batteries only last for 150-200 flashes, with a slower and slower recycle time in between flashes. These Sanyo batteries lasted me over 1500 shots on one charge, with less than a second of recycle time in between flashes; that is simply amazing.I highly recommend these batteries to anyone who has a power intensive device that requires a quick recycle time",0
3373,"My favorite storage solution. I would like to second Aaron's review.  I've also had a hard time finding these.  Maybe it's an East Coast thing.  I use them to organize my music CD's, my computer program CD's, and my hard drive back ups.  The comments regarding the lack of space for liner notes are true, but that's not an issue for me, personally.  I find them very flexible, cost effective, and space saving.  I'm pretty excited to see them here at Amazon.",0
3374,"Awasome!!. The screen works perfectly!  If you take your laptop everywhere, this is a must have... even going into meeting at work.It does get dusty rather quickly which just mean that you have to wipe it more.  Not something to stop you from buying it",0
3375,"Great TV. The Flat LCD has bright color, decent sound, and many input options. I was dissapointed in the DVI input - I plugged my macbook pro in and found the image quite grainy.  I was also dissapointed with the composite in - I pluged my video ipod in and the resulting image wasn't great either.  All aside however, my xbox 360 going through the component looks fantastic. Even with games that have fast moving action, there is very little ghosting - the TV really keeps up.  The graphics look very sharp.  I played a DVD through the xbox and it looked very good as well. When I stopped thinking of this TV as a monitor I came to terms that the TV part is great, but it isn't a monitor.  The DVI port is a bit missleading.  There really should just be an HDMI port.  Overall though - great TV for little money",0
3376,"TERK HDTV Antenna. I bought this antenna for use with a new Samsung 40"" LCD tv.I have always used rabbit ears for reception of our local philly stations on our old analog set.The intention was to mount this unit in the attic, so we would no longer require rabbit ears on our new high tv.Product is much larger than I expected, with a width of more than 2 feet, so if you plan on putting the antenna near the TV, I would reccomend a smaller one.I feel the quality of the unit is a little low. High winds could collapse the ""arms"" (unit comes collapsed) I would hesitate to mount this outside, but because I was mounting in the attic, it was not a concern of mine.when I got the antenna, I held it in my hand and hooked it up to our old set. I was not reassured. picture was much worse in all direstions than with rabbit ears.When I got the new TV, I hooked up rabbit ears to test it immediately before signing for delivery. Reception with just rabbit ears was already much better than my old set. It made me an immediate fan of the digital broadcasts. I recieved some ""blocking"" and cutting out of sound on some stations. Once the TV was connected to the Terk unit in the attic however, all stations came in perfectly. A great antenna, that does what it says. I would recommend something more substantial for mounting outside, and I would reccomend trying rabbit ears before splurging on this, but it does what I wanted and hoped for for my area. (outside philly 15 miles from towers).As always, service from Amazon was great. (I avoid other merchants due to hidden shipping charges and return policies",0
3377,"Great portable/exercise phones. Convenient, tiny, secure-fitting, super-comfortable.  Very decent sound quality for this price-range, too.I recently changed to using Koss KSC-75 clip ons, which sound significantly better, but are a little fussy to get fitting properly and aren't as secure and comfortable.Ultimately, I prefer the Koss clip-ons for the better sound, but these are probably a better option for exercise or for long-term wearing",0
3378,Fantastic. The ice works well the auto mode is real simple and the unit corects the file for laying it on the scanner at weird angles,0
3379,"Awesome mobile mouse!. Not only is this mouse stylish and for a cause, it is very easy to use and a high quality product!  I love that the USB connector resides inside the mouse, so you can't lose it.  This mouse is extremely easy to set up when you are on the go and need something mobile.  It's comfortable and works extremely well.  I use in during all of my meetings and all of my coworkers want one!  I highly recommend this product",0
3380,"Absolutely Fantastic. I have tried to do this over the years with other products....with limited success. This one works perfectly. Very well engineered and thought out. A breeze to install. Rather exensive, but worh every penny",0
3381,"Excellent Printer. This printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear.  I have a Cybershot T-1 camera and the combination is nice.  The printer speed was quick too! I couldn't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the TV and view the pictures that I had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control.  I would recommend this printer because of the easy setup, quick printing speed, and excellent quality of the pictures",0
3382,"Great Features and Performance. So far the APC Back-UPS RS1500VA has been working very well. It switches over to battery power instantly without so much as a flicker on my monitor. The features are excellent in my opinion, with adjustable settings for voltage and noise levels. The description of the unit does not say whether or not it is generator compatible, but the manual seems to hint that the unit can be adjusted to work with a generator.The unit has plenty of reserve power for multiple or prolongled outages, and the control program lets you specify how long to wait before shutting down your system. The-power out alarm can also be adjusted to not sound during certain times such as at night when people are sleeping, or can be turned off altogether.The build quality of the unit seems to be excellent and the case is quite sturdy. I've owned APC products before and they have been of excellent quality too, this one is no exception",0
3383,Good Radio with that price. Pro-good reception. I used it in the bus.Con-Don't have pre-station saving feature. Don't have lock button function therefore buttons are easy touched.Delivery is fast as promised,0
3384,Kingston 1GB Data traveler. Excellent product at a great price.  Shipping was quick.  Never had a problem with Amazon vendors,0
3385,"Best for the money...for a musician. The M-Audio Audiophile 2496 is probably the best all-around soundcard available today. I am a musician, so for me, recording in a high quality was very important, and the gsif support was the main reason I purchased this. For the non-musician though, this soundcard might be passed up for the simple reason of convenience.The Audiophile uses RCA jacks, not the common stereo jacks (1/8"" or 1/4"") found on the cheap soundcard most computers come with. So if you want this to work with a typical set of computer speakers, you'll need an RCA to stereo adapter.I recommend this heartily to any musician, but to the non-musician, a simpler, less powerful soundcard is definitely recommended",0
3386,Doesn't like cold windshields. I have found that this suction cup tends to fall of when the windshield gets cold.  A little saliva on the suction cup prior to putting it up tends to help.  You can also mount the suction cup on the dashboard using the disk provided.  A good idea if you have a deep dashboard.,0
3387,"Beats Sony and Samsung by a long shot. No HDCP handshake issues as are often found on the Sony playersDetachable power cable, beats sony player.Upgradable firmware, beats sony player.Region coding, beats sony player.The overall look and design build is not quite as good as the sony player, however it FUNCTIONs much better.Basically if you are looking for a pretty DVD player w/ sub par functions get a sony.If you want a fully functional upscaling DVD player that is future proof thanks to firmware upgrades, you can not go wrong for this price",0
3388,"Happy linux gamer. I ordered this item because I only had a 64mb TNT Riva 2 card, which wasn't giving a great performance, and because I was able to find it cheap.  After installing it, there was minimal hassle getting it to work in Ubuntu 6.06, and it ran smoothly after that.  I've been able to crank up the details in the games I play and still get a decent FPS rate, but found that it might be underclocked, I plan on taking it to a friends to have him take a look",0
3389,Sony headphones. Great crystal clear sounding lightweight headphones make my Ipod sound fantastic. I'm hearing parts of songs I was never quite able to hear clearly,0
3390,"Good sound quality, awkward microphone. Provides good sound quality and comfort.  The main drawback is the microphone is a clip on and has no good spot on the headphones or the wire that would make it easy to use.  Other than that great headphones",0
3391,Brighter colors and more reliable!. Generic refills are cheaper but the colors aren't as vivid and consistent!  I never use generic!  Trust the name you trusted your printer with when you bought it-- HP!  Can't beat the quality,0
3392,"Fantastic, well-built Radio AND LED Light source. Very well built, right down to the battery compartment! This is a very sensitive receiver, with DEPENDABLE analog tuning. The LED light source is bright. The switches are logical in their placement. I own SIX of these radios. These are stored for emergency use. Think about this the next time you have a power outage at your house: A radio with a light source is not only useful for you as an adult to listen to the weather and news, it comforts children with that light! It also gives them something to do, 'learning' about radio and electricity in general. One radio for EACH child means that you will always have a working unit on hand--here redundancy counts! And GUESS WHAT! IF you break a whip antenna, ETON CARRIES REPLACEMENT PARTS that you can order right from their web site!!! Now, how many times have you seen a radio manufacturer that actually carries parts? I haven't had such parts availability since about the 1960's!",0

3395,Rockin labels. These labels are great.  I use them in my business with the Dymo 400 to make bar code labels and for sale stickers.  They are just the right size to put on my product for customers to see and for the employees to find the barcodes and scan.  Dymo has saved me alot of money with this product,0
3396,"Simply perfect for the money. As above, they simply sound great for the money.  And they have a volume thing in the wire, witch is great for when you have the ipod in the pocket or something.  When I got this thing I also got sony and Griffins ""earphones"" but I didn't like those fittings at all.  I only use this now",0
3397,"Peace of mind for the MacBook owners/lovers !!!. Hi there,I am writing this review after having used the product for almost 2 months now. From the moment I bought my MacBook, I was looking for a case that would protect my macbook without sacrificing it's look. The very reason many people buy a mac is for it's beautiful design and who in the world would want to spoil that look and how would you actually do that without hurting it by day to day use? Voila! I came across this product. The case is pretty hard plastic and has some nice cuts that gives good grip while holding/carrying the macbook. It covers the macbook completely at the top and at the bottom with openings on the sides for the different ports. There are fin like openings on the bottom case for heat to dissipate. That way you wouldn't have to worry about the macbook overheating.The only thing bothers me with this product is that once you put it in on your mac, it is difficult to remove it. I sometimes feel that I might damage the egdes when trying to open. This may also be because I am not doing it the right way ;-)But anyways, I would recommend this product for any macbook lover that wants to protect it from being scratched or damaged.Lok",0
3398,"Great Value and Impressive Features. I bought the Ebookman 901 without knowing anything about it, and I have been very pleasantly surprised at how versatile it is. Just add a 128 MB MMC card (which are now pretty reasonable on E-bay) and you can have 2 hours of music to go! I have another 64 MB MMC card in it on which I have all the books I have downloaded. A 64 MB card will hold almost 100 regular books! The MobiPocket Reader is great for casual reading, and the Franklin Reader has all the navigation features to make it great for references. I can read any book in HTML or TXT format, and there are thousands for free on the web. The Ebookman also has some nice accessories like a car stereo adaptor and an AC adaptor for home use. The PDA functions like Address Book and Memo Book and Date Book are very handy. There are some really fun games. I take this unit when I am traveling, and am never bored. I think if you read the manual and learn how to use it properly, you will love this device. And now you can find them on E-bay and Heartland America for less than 50 bucks. WOW",0
3399,"I think I made the right choice. I gave my son a Garmin 60C for Christmas last year. Tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any ""big"" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas!It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the Garmin to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?)Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the GPS file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh?2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the Magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, ""NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)"". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and Magellan) more obfuscating than informative. Why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages",0
3400,No more interference!. My old one was giving me nothing but problems. The D-Link works like a dream even on the other side of the apartment. No more dropped signals,0
3401,"You won't be disappointed. I was looking to up-grade my photographic printer and researched The Pro 9000. This printer does a fantastic job, consumes less ink than comparable Epsom printers, and has exceeded my expectations on print quality. Well worth the money if you are serious about your printed images and do not want to keep going to a lab to print your work",0
3402,"Beats the iPod by a longshot!. This is a great MP3 player. It sounds, looks, and feels better than an iPod. The storage capacity is huge. There are only 2 problems.1)The screen is really hard to see in the sun(this might only be with silver, I don't know).2)The software is great, if you're used to it, but, is a little slow compared to Windows Media Player of iTunes.Overall, it is worth more than you pay for. Just buy it",0
3403,"Surely, not just another run of the mill DVD player!. One of the best buys for a DVD player even at 2x the price. Too bad it's silver and has a 'thin' tray",0
3404,Super Sticks!. I just received my Soundsticks yesterday and could not be happier with their performance. I am using them to listen to streaming audio on my PC from a radio station in Italy that plays jazz and the nuances of that style of music are well suited to the Sound Sticks. The sleekness of the design is superb as well. The nice price makes this purchase a home run,0
3405,"Love these!. I've been buying the same ones for over two years now and I've never had a complaint about them. I think I might have had two broken ones in over 700 I've ordered. I love the clear backs, as I insert the song list behind the CD so I can see what's on there without opening the case.A great buy IMHO.",0
3406,"Great media player. I'm not someone that is hardcore ipod or hardcore microsoft.  I just wanted a good media player that was simple to use and that had plenty of features.  The Zune fits what I wanted perfectly.  There are several pros and cons to the Zune.The screen is a great size.  The player appears to be a bit wide, but it's not that big of a deal and the weight is just about right.  I wish it came with some of the basic accessories, but it doesn't.  Instead you have to pay big bucks to buy a few extra necessary pieces (AC adapter for example).  You can use the included usb cable to charge it, but at some point you will want the AC adapter.  The battery life is good, but not perfect.  I would like to see some additional battery life out of it.  The controls are easy to use and the menu options are exactly what you need.  The menus aren't cluttered, but they provide just enough navigation.You should definitely let the device upgrade its firmware when you first plug it in.  There have been several major updates.  The Zune software works just fine.  Overall, the software and device are simple to use, quick, and deliver exactly the content I want without a hassle.  I have been very pleased with my purchase.  I considered waiting for a second release of the Zune, but I decided to give this one a shot.  I'm glad I did.",0
3407,"The Best Earphones Ever. I have to tell you that i've always hated earphones. They were always falling out of my ears and the sound was terrible. They never had the one thing I craved, BASS!!! I read most of the reviews about these earphones at Amazon and I was sold. My dreams have finally came true, these are the best earphones for my 80gb ipod that I ever had. The BASS IS OUTSTANDING and I only spent $119.99 + $9.99(s/h) at EBAY! I have small ears and these fit perfectly (it comes with 3 different size earplugs) I am very skeptical so I want to tell all my other fellow skeptics to buy these earphones a.s.a.p!!!!",0
3408,Works well on my Mac. I needed a good mike to cut the echo when using Skype. This mike fills the bill. It is directional so the speakers don't feed back into it causing the people on the other end of Skype to hear themselves talk. Just what I needed,0
3409,Good item. I have a svideo-rca cable but my Dell 700M doesn't reconize the TV input. So I tried this one and it works great! I will give it 5 stars if they can charge a more reasonable shipping. $11 bucks for a simple adaptor is too expensive in my opinion,0
3410,Nice A/V receiver. A quality receiver for your home theater. Sounds and looks good at a great price,0
3411,"Canon printer ink. Excellent quality.  A bit more expensive than the ""compatible"" brands, but worth it for the reliability",0
3412,"Buy the extension cable for the antenna. If you plan to buy this and cannot mount the antenna outside, forget it. I tried it in two windows with no luck. I ended up having to run the wire throught the window and outside, it looks ugly for now but it works great. When I receive the extension I plan to run it alongside my TV cable wire and around the foundation of the house. Great sound when connected to my home stereo system. Between the car, the home dock, and the internet radio-I think I end up listening to Sirius about 6-8 hours a day. I don't think it will ever get old either",0

3414,Great set. Great set.  Wonderful picture.  Lots of inputs - including a cablecard which I love.  Great 1080i.  Don't know how it handles 1080p since I don't have my PS3 - yet.  Not clear if it will do 1080p on the HDMI although the specs are clear it will do that on the components.Only some oddball things annoy me:* Very hard to set favorite channels.  Just gave up.* Labelling of the channels does not include channel logos (like my LG does; great feature)* Lack of a guide.  Kind of stupid to have a cablecard and have to switch to the Comcast STB to see what's on.* PIP seems to be restrictive on what can be in the main picture.  You can put the digital tuner in the PIP but you can't activate the PIP if the digital tuner is the main picture (not the PIP)* Menu system is slow.  Often you click the remote and the menu doesn't change.  Thought for a while the remote signal did not register but now think the menu is just slow and misses the signal,0
3415,"Good for the car too. I have a Kenwood Sirius setup in my car, but the antenna connection became loose so I tried this one out as a replacement and surprisingly it fits much better than the Kenwood one - even though all my gear is Kenwood branded. The snug fit and larger antenna size contribute to a more reliable signal with noticeably less dropouts than before",0
3416,"Cheap way to make editing movies a ton easier. I bought this little gadget thinking ""Its cheap enough I  won't care if it doesn't work good.""  Now, I can't imagine using iMovie or Final Cut Express without it.  The jog and shuttle controls make it very easy and quick to zip through video clips or to fine tune the position, frame by frame.  The keys across the top are all programmable to issue the keys you want.  You don't have to take the stock pre-programmed keys that come as defaults.If you tinker with editing videos the ShuttleXpress is a no-brainer",0

3420,"Just enough. I bought this card because I was in a particular jam.  I had to tailor my video card purchase not to my bank account, but to my power supply.  The eVGA card was one of the few decent cards that would work with a 250w power supply, which is what my Dell box has. I know the eVGA box says 300w minimum, but their website says 250w.  The card works GREAT for Battlefield 2142, the reason I bought the card.  I even have the details cranked up to medium and am now seeing things that I didn't see at the low setting.  No lag induced by the eVGA video card and again, if you like Battlefield 2142, this is a GREAT, inexpensive way to get into the gam",0

3423,"Very nice. This Sleeve is very good looking and smart. Only thing I don't like is that the 13"" Macbook JUST fits in it. Therefore when zipping it up the zipper does catch slightly on the macbook.",0
3424,"Picture and sound are good, but setup is unnecessarily complicated. Olevia doesn't make setup of this TV as simple as it should be.  Not only is a printed manual not provided, but the on-screen setup menu is the least intuitive menu I've ever worked with.Our TV reception is satellite via Dishnetwork.  I also recently purchased a Sharp Aquos LCD TV, and setup for that was a breeze -- plug it in, attach coaxial cable, turn it on, and it does the rest iteself.  Easy and quick.But after connecting this set to the coaxial cable and plugging it in, I couldn't get a picture or sound.  I read through the manual-on-CD and tried the on-screen menu -- no help.  I finally searched through Olevia's website -- and found step-by-step instructions.  About 10 steps via the remote are required.  Very nice that the info was there, but it also should be in the manual!  The reason for this is, according to their website, that the TV as it is shipped is set for showrooms, NOT consumers.  Ergo all the extra 10 or so steps that ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THE CD MANUAL.  If you get this set, do this:  bypass the manual and the on-screen menu during installation and go straight to their website instead.Okay, besides that, the TV is fine.  I've only had it a day and have no other complaints or problems.  However, it makes no sense to me why Olevia would prepare their TVs for showrooms and not consumers.Note:  I chose this item based on Consumer Reports ratings.  Also, I didn't purchase it from Amazon, but instead from another online vendor.  I'm curious if others who did purchase via Amazon had similar experiences with their Olevia LCD TVs.",0
3425,A wonderful unit. I researched what was the best 5 disc changer and this has all the needed features. Continues to get high marks from various consumer groups. Sometimes I have trouble with the automatic play the next dics but I think that is due to a setting I have incorrect. This is the second one I have purchased. First one the power switch is bad we think and it was less money to purchase new than fix. Will probably fix first on the cheap and give to a friend. Then if second one does same thing we know how to fix it.Overall a great playe,0

3428,"I love this radio - For it's AM reception. I've had several pocket radios and this one is the best I've had.  I use it mostly for AM.  This radio's reception often impresses me.  I can now pick up AM stations in places where other radios only gave me static.I like the placement of the buttons, they're good sized, well spaced, and easy to get to without having to remove the radio from my pocket.  The memory buttons are right on top so they're easy to get to as well.  Screen is good size and easy to read.  Unit also has a button to boost bass if needed.  It's a very easy to use radio.Some negatives to pass on:FM reception is decent, nothing spectacular, and TV reception is so-so.  I don't use it much for those two bands so it doesn't matter to me.  If your planning to buy it for FM you may want to do some more research before buying, I suspect there's better pocket radios for FM.Also, I wasn't too crazy about the earbuds that came with it.  The sound was so-so and the ones I already owned were better so they're the ones I use.Overall I'm glad I bought this radio.",0

It works nicely, but the bumping in and out of the water causes the locking mechanism to slide over to the unlocked position frequently (like within 2 minutes).  The product should have been designed to accommodate this problem.  I have put a little piece of plastic in the groove that the slider slides in and secured that piece of plastic by wrapping a tie wrap around the entire GPS and GPS holder.  Now it is secure, but looks a little stupid",0

3440,"Very Good Case. Very good case for my black iPod-NANO.While browsing to find the ideal Nano-Case, I read in a previous review for this product that some kind of plastic was included in the package for Nano-screen protection, and that it was a useless, cheap piece of plastic.In my opinion, this plastic protection, has turned out to be an EXCELLENT protection for my Nano-Screen.  This ""plastic"" sticks nicely to the screen, and has NO ADHESIVE whatsoever, so you can remove and reapply very easily, leaving not a single trace on your Nano-screen (no bubbles either while on the Nano-screen).The case itself is pretty rugged and offers excellent protection to my tiny iPod.  It does add some bulk (not much), but at least, I'm now having less trouble finding the Nano over my cluttered desktop !!All buttons and connections are easily accesible while wearing the case, so there's really no need to be taking the Nano out of its protection.Looks are great and high quality details.I give this product a 4-star rating only because no instructions were included in the box for the correct application of the Nano-screen protection.  Otherwise this product would be a 5+",0
3441,"It's called the Ultra Mini for a reason!. This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub.The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately.In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk",0

Sometimes the prices move as often as hourly and in very large amounts. These are wonderful DVD cases that I bought from Amazon.com two days ago for the regular price of $5.95. These very same cases today have a regular price of $12.24. That is more then a 200% mark up and is absolutely ridiculous. I can buy these very same cases at my local Meijer today for $6.95.

3449,"A beautiful display!. I've just replaced my ViewSonic VX924 gaming LCD with the Samsung 226BW. Wow, what an amazing display! It's 1000x1 contrast ratio is stellar. Blacks are extremely black and there is virtually no backlight bleed. (Backlight bleed tends to make black or dark colors look gray and it's common with LCDs.) The colors are amazingly bright and vivid.  In fact its default settings are almost too bright. Fortunately the 226BW comes preprogrammed with multiple screen modes such as Games, Internet, Movies, Sports, Custom, Default, etc. I prefer the Internet setting as the backlight is turned down to about 75% and it's a lot easier on my eyes in a darkly lit room. The default settings would work best if you are in a brightly lit room, or if you plan on using the display at a distance.The screen has an amazingly fast response time. Samsung claims 2ms gray to gray. I have no way to verify this, but I haven't seen any motion blur when I play video games. Viewing angles are also superior with this screen. I can be quite a ways off center and colors are still vivid and crisp. My old display would look washed out and gray at almost any angle other than directly in front.Keep in mind that this screen runs natively at 1650x1050. It's a rather high resolution for older video cards and if you have an old system then you may experience some stuttering. My 226BW is connected to an ATI Radeon X850XT video card with an AGP 8X interface.  I can play Elder Scrolls: Oblivion with most settings maxed using the screen's native resolution and it looks and plays beautifully. Remember to install the monitor drivers. They are available for both Windows Vista and XP. You can either use the included CD, download them directly from Samsung, or use Windows Update. (I used Windows Update since those drivers are signed.) The drivers aren't required, but it does make the monitor more compatible with the system.The Samsung 226BW has HDCP support through its DVI cable connection which gives it more future compatibility. Soon all monitors will need HDCP support in order to play HD video content. I don't need it now, but it's nice to know it's there.If you really want the best picture out of this display, be sure to use a DVI video cable. (A 3 foot DVI cable and 3 foot VGA cable is included with the display.) VGA is an old style analog connection which was best used with CRT (tube style) monitors. Since LCDs are digital not analog, a digital signal is the best. If you use the VGA connection your video card has to convert the digital signal to analog, then transmit it to the display and the display has to reconvert it back to digital. That's two unneeded video conversions which can result in a washed out picture. With the DVI connection, it's a digital signal directly from the video card to the display with no video conversion, so you get the best picture.I do have two very minor negatives. Both involve the stand. First, the stand does not pivot sideways for portrait style viewing. That's nothing I would use, but many monitors have this option. Second, a wall mounting bracket is not included even though the Samsung 226BW is wall mountable. If you need to wall mount the display, the bracket needs to be purchased separately.Bottom line: The Samsung 226BW is definitely worth the purchase and I know you won't be disappointed!",0

I knew immediately that this dock would make her iPod life easier. She too, loves the dock as much as the iPod. It's great for her to be able to just slip the iPod on and off to be charged.

The bag also has light padding throughout which adds a certain amount of protection from bumps, and a sturdy, quite comfortable shoulder strap. A well designed bag all round, IMHO.",0

3462,"Very Cool & Convenient!. This is an AWESOME little device.Let me start with the pros:1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button & voila.)2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of speakers, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well.3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth speakers, but I am amazed with reception these guys have.4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse & Pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly.5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that.Cons:1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls.2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers.3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers.4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more.For $100, this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing.If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker system. It's great.Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up!FOR OTHER BLUETOOTH IDEAS AND WI-FI NETWORK OPTIONS, see my post at the Hydrogen Audio forum: [...]",0

It can't compete with sunlight (what affordable projector can?) but when the sun goes down or the curtains are closed, the picture rocks.Since HD isn't availble in our area, I can't report how HDTV looks, but the 1080i picture from my XBox and my upconversion DVD player's 720p picture looks flawless.I would have liked to see more connection options - at least 2 HDMI ports would have been welcome.  I also experienced an error that I gather from my research is fairly common: I shutdown the projector, but the fan wouldn't stop running.

Comes with a nice charger so you never have to replace batteries either.Best money spent, great value, and it WORKS. I cannot imagine running my gear without it.  Very easy to use by all genders of all ages.I have no idea why anyone would want to spend $3,000 and have custom programming done for some of the larger controllers - unless you have really bad eyes and need the larger LCD display those controllers offer or if you have a burning need to put your hometheater installers kids through college.",0

3476,"Feng Shui for your Digital Audio Workstation. After 15 years using a Roland U-20 as a midi controller I began to wonder if upgrading would ever be needed. I figured all I needed was something that could trigger midi notes, and my old keyboard did that just fine. Then one day recently I saw a live band using a little 25 note controller to trigger Combinator patches out of Reason, connected only by a USB cable. The little dials on the keyboard were being used musically to change various parameters of the sound. It then occurred to me that maybe I should take a hard look at what has happened in the last 15 years with Midi controllers.Escaping from my local retailer with M-Audio Oxygen 8 v2 in hand, I rushed home to see if these bells and whistles really mattered. Skipping the dated CD-ROM that came in the package, I downloaded the current M-Audio drivers using the World Wide Web. Driver installation was painless, and then I connected the hardware. After windows carefully chewed on three different hardware wizards it was all done. Not bad, although I have some sympathy for anyone who is not familiar with the Windows ""Found New Hardware"" wizard. Fortunately the documentation describes the procedure in detail. The creative session that unfolded over the next few hours is what prompted me to write this review. Long ago it was very difficult to pass ""special"" information over Midi. Users were forced to map out keyboards, sift through menus, and spend hours on configuration. Those days are over! With this current technology, mapping a function to a dial or button is a simple matter. Software like Cubase and Reason just ask for you to touch the dial you want to use. After you give the dial a little twist the software detects it and maps it to the function of your choice. I could not be more pleased with how well this works.The Oxygen 8 V2, which can be powered from USB, has 8 dials, 2 wheels, an LCD readout, and a number of buttons. Some of the included buttons are transport controls, so you can use the keyboard to play, stop, fast forward, rewind, loop, and record. This makes the midi recording functionality feel more like a Motif or Triton, allowing the user to take their eyes off the computer monitor. By the end of the evening I realized my old Roland U-20 simply cannot take advantage of the latest features being offered by today's software. While this little 25 note keyboard is a lot smaller, it's incredibly functional, and takes up a very small footprint on my desk. With the octave button I can live without more keys. This installation has improved the Feng Shui of my workstation area, giving more features in a smaller space. When you first experience what its like to tweak a Reason or VST instrument with a physical dial, and have the software record you doing it, you will wonder why you waited so long to upgrade your giant old midi keyboard. It is truly frightening what can now be achieved with a laptop, a software program such as Reason 3, and an Oxygen 8 V2. You could sit in a coffee shop and be the next Aphex Twin. I recommend caffeinated",0

3480,"Pretty good for the price. I've been using this phone for about a month now, and overall it's pretty good.Pros: Sound quality is good on handset/speakerphone/headset, the controls feel nice, and the unit has a nice clean look. It deals well with the two lines: indicator lights, separate voice mail access codes, hold and conferencing are very easy. Setting up and using the speed dials is very easy (but you only get a few of them, which is fine with me).  You can use the speed dials when you're on the phone, which can be useful for access codes and the like. Caller ID does nothing special, but it works as you'd expect, including with Call Waiting calls.Cons: As others have mentioned, there is no mute button; the voice mail indicator is an LCD instead of a blinking light (really dumb idea).  The LCD display is not backlit and not easily viewed at an angle, and the unit sits flat on a desk, so you have to view it at an angle (I put a piece of wood under it to tilt it up, which helps, but is not a great tribute to Panasonic engineering). Also, plugging in a headset disconnects the handset; with a headset plugged in you can't pick up the handset and talk.Contrary to what another reviewer said, I did find that I could use the first line when there is no power, as the manual claims you can.Overall, I'm happy enough with the unit.  I did plug in a freestanding voice mail indicator light because the ""envelope"" indicator is pretty much useless, but the other problems are not significant in the way I use it",0

3490,"Love it, Love it, Love it!. The iRiver T10/2Gb is perfect for someone who doesn't want to carry around 40-80Gb worth of music they'll never listen to and even more importantly, its truly portable!When I first went to a store asking to buy an mp3 player which ran on batteries, they couldn't understand why anyone would want something so archaic. I had to find somewhere else with an mp3 player with a battery and that is when I came across the T10. I travel a LOT and to a lot of places where taking my computer and/or power plugs along is (a) inconvenient, (b) heavy and (c) useless as there is no power. I can't begin to describe the relief that all I have to do is throw in a couple of spare AA batteries and I've probably got at least a month's worth of playing time there. Why on earth would anyone want an mp3 player that has a rechargeable battery that at best, can provide about 20 odd hours of music? Each time I've put a battery into my iRiver, I have managed to get about a month's worth of listening out of it - and usually it only runs down because I forget to lock it when I turn it off and the on button gets bumped in my bag. So I have yet to test the battery to see if it is actually about 45 hours play time - all I know is it lasts a long, long, long time! Even the other day, with only 1 bar left on the 'how much charge does my battery have"" icon, I still got an extra 6 hours out of it.As to its other features, the sound quality is superb. I have previously owned an iRiver H10 and thought possibly the sound on the T10 was a little tinny in comparison, but I browsed my way into the custom SRS settings and added a little base and believe me, the sound coming out of my headphones now rivals the subwoofer-enforced base coming out of any souped up ghettomobile. I have nooooo complaints about the sound quality!I should also add I am pleased that iRiver use a gold plated tip to their headphones - don't ask me why, but that always seems to reproduce sound quality better.I long gave up on using the iRiver software to transfer music to my T10. The fact is even through the 2Gb works fine for me around town and travelling, I have more than 2Gb of music on my computer. The iRiver software tried to synchronise between your 2Gb T10 and the stuff in ""My Music"" on your Windows-based computer. Not feasible! So I just transfer songs across using Windows Explorer - much greater control and an awful lot quicker! Blow off the software people. However, if you have an older computer, you may need to at least install the driver to recognise the T10 on your computer, but once that is installed, it is very easy to transfer music just using the UBS cable and Windows Explorer.I have used the FM radio (once) when trying to find out some news. It works fine, but is defintely fiddly if you don't use it regularly. Reception was as good as any other portable device broadcasting over the airways though.I find the buttons are very well placed for 'blind pushing' - because the headphone cord sticks out a bit and the device is triangular shaped, its quite easy to put your hand in a bag, feel the jack, feel the flat face and push the buttons to advance songs or change volume without actually having to see the device.And lets not forget the price - substantially cheaper than that ""in unit"" with its white headphones yet more functionality - you not only get an mp3 player with comparable sound quality, but you get a voice recorder and an FM radio as well. For less.My only quibbles (and they are defintely small things) are:- The clip is awkward. It's nice that the device clips onto your belt hook, but juts out and because of the triangular shape due to emplacement of the battery, the controls all end up facing your body and its awkward to twist the device to see the buttons to change songs.-How easily the unit can turn itself on (or off) if you don't use the (very easy to use) lock button.I'd recommend this to anyone who travels, doesn't want to carry a ton of plugs and cords to recharge, and prefers to carry only their really favourite tunes - there is plenty of space for the best of's",0

3492,"Eforcity is a good replacement last longer then original battery. I didn't want to keep plugging in my zen micro at the office just so there's juice on the ride home.

3497,"Wonderful bag!. In the past I have used a backpack to transport my laptop along with my work (I teach college).  Perhaps it's age, but the backpack has seemed very cumbersome and heavy so I was on the lookout for a nice rollerbag.  This one really fit the bill.  Like a previous reviewer, I have looked at a ton of bags and being very petite (5'1"") size and weight was a tremendous consideration.  I was leaning toward the Swiss Gear Patriot and another Kensington bag and even went so far as to purchase them from an online vendor with local in-store pickup.  I arrived at the store before the order was ready and thought I'd look to see what other bags the store had to offer.  That's when I got a look at this bag (saw it online, but couldn't find pictures of the inside of the bag so I was hesitant).  It was exactly what I needed with a few nice surprises.  First, the other reviewers are spot on with their reviews. This bag is super lightweight, easy to roll and easy to pick up (with either the handle or shoulder strap) when you need to (I pick it up when I climb the stairs to my classes).  I love that it is more of a feminine looking bag.  The inside of the pockets and main compartment (though not the rear compartment) has a really pretty chocolate brown pinstripe liner (okay, I like pretty things).  The zipper for the main compartment opens almost to the bottom sides of the bag, which makes accessing your things very simple.  It has a padded compartment for your computer at the rear of the bag with an elastic strap to keep the computer from moving around too much.  I can easily access my 12"" Powerbook, but it's a slightly tighter fit with my 15.4"" MacBook Pro.  Also, the top 2 inches of the MBP are not protected by the padding so I use a neoprene sleeve for added protection.  This makes a bit more effortful to remove the laptop, but not annoyingly so.  Another nice touch is that the laptop compartment allows the computer to suspend slightly within the bag so that the computer never touches the bottom of the bag.  The main compartment also holds all of my files for class, as well as my textbook (paperback) and a small notebook.  In contrast to a backpack, I can easily identify which files belong to which class so I don't have to pull all of my folders out everytime.  There's also room for my power adapter and my presentation remote case.  The rear compartment is handy for other computer accessories like cables, a power adapter, an umbrella.  You can see the telescoping part of the handle in this section as it is exposed.  This didn't bother me at first until I realized that when I am rolling the bag I can actually see into this compartment when the handle is extended (when stored there is a zipper that covers the handle).  Not much is exposed, but if it's raining I'll most likely carry the bag or just make sure things in that compartment won't be bothered by a little wetness (don't let this distract you, the bag it otherwise water resistant and I don't see it as a huge problem).  The smaller zippered section has lots of little compartments for pens, a flash drive, iPod, and other computer accessories.  I also keep two glasses cases, my Palm Pilot and wallet in this section.  I like that this section opens up real wide and has some material on the sides so things don't fall out when you open it completely.  The smaller zippered compartment on this outside of this section is great for flat things like tissues, post-it notes, etc.  The top easy access zipper pocket is super convenient too!  I keep my keys there (though wish there was a key clip) along with things like my phone, chapstick, lipstick and a small bottle of lotion.  It is also great for storing a boarding pass and a bit of cash when I travel.  As previously mentioned, this bag fits very easily under airline seats.  The strap at the back of the bag that is intended to allow you to place it over the telescoping handle of another roller bag.  The strap does not cover the width of the bag and might not fit over some handles.  It works with most standard ones, but the Hartmann bag I have has an EXTRA wide handle and the strap wasn't wide enough to handle it.  I have to use the piggy-back system to take these two on trips together (which makes for easier rolling anyway).All in all, this is a fabulous bag for my needs.  The price here is also excellent.  I was happy that I paid $70 as it was listed on Amazon for $92 though now it is listed for $57.89!  You can't beat that price!  I would not hesitate to buy this bag again",0

3499,"An Excellent Little Player. I've had my Sansa (the white one, with a pink silicone case... very cute) for about a month now and I couldn't be more pleased. I've had several players -- an Archos, an iaudio 'u2' -- and though both had their quirks, especially the Archos, ultimately the problem with both was the same -- their rechargeable internal (non-CHANGEable) batteries wore out and wouldn't hold a charge anymore. In contrast, the Sansa takes one AAA battery. Such a simple thing, but what a joy, I'll have the player long enough to see if it wears out normally from use! It comes with a battery, and I haven't had to change mine yet.Radio reception seems rather good. It doesn't have line-in recording, as the iaudio did, but I didn't use that very much and haven't missed it. Has voice recording, which I haven't tried. Mounts right up on WinXP without any need for extra software. I've never wanted an ipod, because of the nightmarish software required to negotiate with them.The Sansa's supplied ear buds sound very good, but are a trifle large (which is probably why they sound so good to me), noticeably larger than ipod ear buds; but are a little too large for my ears.One more thing, I am pleased with the Sansa's interface -- there are enough buttons to comfortably handle all functions. The 'u2' had only a few buttons, a tiny display and no manual to speak of, and was a little frustrating to use. The Sansa is much clearer, has a very readable display, and very straightforward function selection and settings. Cleverness and simplicity is all well and good in a gadget, but take it from someone whose vision is not terribly good, if you can't see it, you can't use it. I'm glad I got this one",0
3500,"Journalist's Ideal Tool. This is pretty much the perfect tape recorder for interviews, whether live or phone -- sturdy but light for carrying, with plenty of bells and whistles but a snap to learn to use. (However, inserting tapes is  slightly harder than in some other machines.) You can choose slow-speed recording to double the length of your tape (e.g., get two hours of talk on a 60-minute tape), which minimizes interrupting the flow of the interview to change sides or tapes. On playback, a speed-control dial lets you control speed and tone of speech -- you can slow down a fast jabberer to transcribe, or speed up to chipmonk-voices past the less useful chatter without missing anything. Plugging in the adapter spares the batteries when transcribing, i.e. when hitting the ""pause"" button instead of ""stop"" for interruptions that last longer than anticipated. Sound quality is fine for talk. Not much machine-hiss, and even less on slow speed than on regular speed. Much easier to change batteries than on my previous tape recorder(another Sony which finally died after 25 years of service). Haven't tried this machine for music.",0

Remember to hold it still and don't let the cable rub against clothing. Also, watch your breathing. It all gets picked up!

3506,"So cooool!. It's cool to look at AND functional -- how often does that happen?It's the size of a credit card, and weights only 2.5 oz (71 grams.)Things I noticed:- I simply plugged it into the USB port; Windows found it and it worked instantly and flawlessly!- The wheel has good grip on it (unlike my last Targus mouse.)- When it is just sitting there, the 7 colours fade in and out.  Now, I was thinking this would be distracting and too bright, but I found that they are actually soft and subtle.  It so ""Mac"" (I have no other way to describe it.)- In the design traditon of the new Mac products, this mouse is a nice steel grey with a very slick, polished surface that feels nice.  The buttons are nice, too.- The sensitivity seems to be higher/better than my previous mouse.  But, I would rather have to turn down the sensitivity than have to turn it up (only to find it's at the max already.)- As the colours rotate through, they stop rotating when you use the mouse, and resume when you stop.- The retractable cord-thing WORKS!  And quite well.  I was worried about it when I purchased it, but I now think it's one of the best features.If you are looking for a travel mouse, or one that will make other coworkers jealous, this mouse is for you",0

More like being in a concert setting than hearing sound from a box.Quibbles?  The volume controls are nearly impossible to find, but that makes them inconspicuous once you've found them!  The subwoofer is not tiny in terms of fitting under a desk (12"" diameter).  If you can't imagine yourself fidgeting with the fishbowl in stockinged feet you might pass on this item.

I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)Down to business - the Handspring Visor Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore.  But in its day it was.  Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this.  Totally flawless.  People often complain about the styli of other PDAs.  No complaints here.  Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device.  I literally lost my ORIGINAL stylus just a few days ago.The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it.

3518,"Greate MS mouse, my wrist feels better. MOUSE ERGONOMICSI'm on the computer 12 hours a day and my wrist has been bothering me. When using most mice, your wrist is on the table, and hand is cranked up at an angle over the mouse. This completely changes your mouse posture. It is a massively tall mouse that completely angles your hand when using it.Here's what the mouse instructions recommends:The pinky edge of your hand is on the table, and your hand wraps the side of the 2.5"" tall mouse, so your hand is almost sideways the whole time. Takes some getting use to, but at least all presure is off your wrist.Here's what I prefer:I use a mouse pad with a thickly padded wrist rest. The part of my forearm right before the wrist is on the wrist rest, and the hand is on the tall, (right-hand) slanted mouse, so my wrist is hanging in mid-air. This feels pretty natural for me and no more wrist pains.MOUSE PERFORMANCEIt performs very well, as well as any other MS laser mouse. Laser works on most surfaces, but not on glass or glossy surfaces. It's been 2 months and I haven't had to change the batteries yet.Pros:All of the above.Cons:Sometimes I do get inconsistent velocity when I move the mouse at constant speed but the cursor does'nt.

3519,"Mixed Feelings After Four Years. There is still a lot to love about the S350, big full sound, incredible FM reception, generally strong AM reception, good rugged looks. But the drift is a minor annoyance. Worse, two AM stations here in Los Angeles, 1150 and 980 (Dodgers baseball), get overcrowding, meaning two stations are playing at once, and no matter how narrow the filter I get this overcrowding. My 40-dollar GE Superradio III doesn't have this problem. But the GE doesn't have digital readout and I hate finding the sweet spot. So is there a big digital radio that doesn't have these flaws? I hear there is. Soon there will be a radio available called the Redsun 3000, designed by the same maker of the Grundig S350 (called the Tecsun BCL 2000 in China), which is supposed to blow away all the competition. Already the Redsun 2100 is said to be superior to the 350 but has ergonomic problems. As of 9-22-06, the Redsun 3000 is supposed to be only a few months away. Until the Redsun 3000 arrives, you may want to look at the $99 Sonido (made by Sangean). It boasts presets, digital tuning, and adds to its FM/AM a TV band, but has no shortwave.Final Point: If you're buying a radio for your office and you use a computer, I suggest you get a good table radio with a remote control, like the Sangean WR-2 or its big brother the Sangean HDR-1, a high-definition radio. I point this out because any radio I've used within five feet of my computer suffers from horrible interference. Place the WR-2 ($159) or the HDR-1 ($199 after rebate) on a shelf or cabinet six feet away or so and use your remote to toggle between preset stations. In my experience these remote-control-operated radios are well suited for computer environments.Update 12-31-06: I've been able to get rid of overcrowding on AM station 980 by turning down the AM/SW RF Gain knob. So I have to give a fifth star to the S350",0

The cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won't break during shipment. Moreover, the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty.My only complaint is that the ink goes rather quickly and thus the cost of this ink over the long run can be expensive. I rarely print and nevertheless just about every two months I still have to buy another cartridge. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review.The price is absolutely right compared to what stores in my area charge for this product. If you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink HP 92; this would be even more cost-efficient.Overall, the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than I would like it to go.

I too had a number of failed burns with that program, but I was able to remedy the situation by saving my dvd projects as disc images, and then burning them later with disc utility after I had a chance to mount them and check them out.  For the price I payed for these discs, if I remember right, almost half the price of a 25 pack from other companies for a 50 pack from memorex, I am very very pleased.  If you're looking to play around with dvd burning, and I guarantee you you will make a few mistakes and have to throw away a few discs before you get it right, this is the best deal you'll find anywhere",0
3541,"just got this in an office pollyanna. I just won this item at an office holiday party. After reading the packaging for about 30 minutes, I figured out what it was supposed to be. At this point, I should have been disappointed, but I was surprised and pleased by the quality radio reception it gets. Perfect for ""emergencies"" (ie drowning out annoying office banter).At our party, my coworkers got cool stuff like top-shelf liquor and bathing liquids. But I am satisfied with this, I guess.",0

3543,"Great phone, no complaints. Works great, good sound.  I wanted a 5.8 phone to avoid interference problems.  I wanted a phone without an answering system because my phone provider (Vonage) does answering.  This phone fit my needs perfectly.  A nice feature is the local name/number database, which the phone uses before it uses caller ID, so you can put your own names on inbound callers.  I think it lets you assign ring tones too, but I don't use that feature.  It also interprets the ""you have voicemail"" codes from your service provider so it can display ""new voice mail"" when your provider has new voice mail messages",0
3544,"Great Headphones for the runner. Sennheiser got it right. These are simple. They are comfortable, even on long runs. They have great sound. They stay put while I am running. Gravity is the enemy on other headphones I've used, always making them slip out of the ear or away from the position of optimal sound. Because of the design of these earpieces and conecting band, gravity actually holds them in place. I never have to fidget with them. Also, since there is only one lead wire, it stays out of the way without trying to engineer a solution. These are the best I've tried",0
3545,"Handy Way to Use Roady2. First of all - I really enjoy listening to XM radio, which is what made me consider buying this extension device for the receiver. It is truly a good way to further utilize the Roady2, allowing you to listen either to XM, or to tune in local FM stations (why anyone would want to do this, I don't know - maybe an emergency or something).The unit is fairly simple to set up. You first need to charge the battery by putting it into place and plugging in the included AC adapter. It takes about 2 hours to charge and then you are ready to use the unit. You slide the Roady2 into the device until it plugs in. (If you have set up the Roady2 for a Home adapter or auto adapter - you must first remove the backing plate on the Roady2 - it will snap off with a little leverage (light) with a straight edge screwdriver.) After you have installed the Roady2 unit, you are good to go.At first, the volume and tuning controls on the side of the unit can be a little vexing to use, but some practice helps you to readily raise or lower the volume or tune FM radio stations. As an additional help, there is a small wheel volume control on the right ear section of the headphones. The headphone acts as your antenna for the unit and the whole thing then works very well.I am pleased with this unit, but I would advise shopping for price, as it can vary by as much as $100.00 from low to high.All in all, a nice addition to further utilize the Roady2",0
3546,"Excellent!. The Logitech Presenter does everything it claims it will do - easily and flawlessly.  No software to install, virtually no learning curve at all - you just plug it in and it works.From other reviews I had read, I was a little concerned that the laser pointer would not remain sharp over a long distance.  But I gave a presentation in an auditorium last week, and, from about 75 feet away, it was fine.Since the Presenter has no remote mouse function, I did have to go over to my laptop to right-click on the screen in order to go directly to a slide that was 10 slides back from where I was in my presentation.  (I did not want to step sequentially back through 10 slides on the screen, which I could have done with the Presenter.)  So, next time I would put more importance on buying a presenter with remote mouse function; but, I'd also want it to have the compactness and ease of use of this one.Overall, an excellent, high-quality product",0
3547,"Excellent, Versatile, Good Price. The nice, light lustre finish makes a good compromise between glossy, without annoying reflections, and matte, offering some extra saturation and snap.  This is very good paper, at an affordable price.

3559,"CD Burning Tips. These brush cleaner CD's do work, believe it or not.  Perhaps not quite the same as having your system professionally serviced, but why waste more money than you may have to.  This is a worthy investment to look into first - because these do work most of the time (and it's always a good idea to have one for continued preventative maintenance anyway).  If you're getting play errors or severe skipping of your CD's, you might be amazed at how much one of these can help.But here's a few tips for those of you making audio CD's on their home computers and having trouble playing them on some machines... It may not be a defective or dirty player at all.First, it may be best to turn off any other programs you may have running in the background.  This will give your CD burner full resources to do its burning job.  Also, make sure your screensaver is turned off.  If it starts up in the middle of a job, the laser burn may be interrupted and cause errors.  So shut down all other programs and the screensaver too.Second, it may do you well to defrag your hard drive before starting a burn.  If you have a pretty fast PC, this may not be a big problem, but it may adversely affect the read data process if your computer has to search all over the hard drive to find pieces of the media files before burning them on the disk.  I personally have an auto defrag program installed on my computer that runs constantly keeping my system running at its optimum.Third, I recommend NOT copying CD's ""on the fly"" (in other words, directly from disk to disk).  Copy the audio files to your hard drive first.  Most CD burning software have a ""create image"" option - use that and then burn the image to a blank CD.  If your using Nero, just turn off the ""on the fly"" option and the music files will copy to the hard disk first and then to the CD automatically.  By-the-way, you may want to read my review on Amazon about Nero.  It is, in my opinion, the best burning software available!  Since I started using Nero, I do not know the meaning of the word ""coaster"" or ""frisbee.""Fourth, ALWAYS burn CD's in DAO mode (Disc At Once).  This will insure there is no gap between songs(TAO - Track At Once - usually leaves a 2 second gap between songs and causes the laser to have to stop burning momentarily between songs), but more importantly, using DAO will insure that the laser continues to burn constantly throughout the whole CD copying process.Finally, and most importantly (in my opinion), make sure you don't burn CD's at anything faster than 12x!  In fact, if you're playing CD's on an older system, burn the CD at 8x or even slower.  If you still have trouble, take the speed all the way down to 1 or 2x.  It can make a big difference.  Yes, I know it means you won't be using the full potential of your zippy 52x burner, but you just have to figure out what is more important - fast burning or being able to actually listen to what your burning?Most newer CD players have very little or no problem at all playing CD's burned on a computer at the highest speed; however, this is not often the case with much older units.  As a general rule it is always better to burn audio disks slower.You may also want to make sure you're using Audio CD certified media.  That may help a little bit too.  The brand of media may be a factor also.  Sometimes the cheaper CD's may have a higher failure rate.  I've heard this from some people.  Personally, I have not had too much trouble with cheaper CD's...  Usually, if the steps I have already mentioned are followed, cheap media will work fine.  That has been my experience anyway.  But different burners may be a factor as well and you may want to try some different brands of media until you find one that seems to work best for you.  Using quality name brand media is probably a safe bet and may be your best course of action.Good luck! :",0

3566,"Excellent hardware but has some issues. Moving up to the DiNovo line of keyboard is quite a financial commitment for most users. With that you expect certain things to be flawless and from a hardware design standpoint that is what you get. The software is another story.On initial installation the SetPoint software came up after the mandatory reboot and was stuck on attempting to connect to the devices. After a forced shutdown and reboot it was able to continue the setup process and found the devices. To make a long story short, the SetPoint software became such a headache that I removed it entirely and used the keyboard and mouse without it and lost some of the features of the keyboard because of it, volume adjusment, media center control, etc.Some issues occurred with the media pad in games that only allowed it to be in numlock mode, but the game required the number pad to be used for navigation. I actually had to buy a seperate numpad device to resolve thiss problem.Overall the design and feel of this keyboard/media pad/mouse is amazing, but the software issues make it a headache to use at times. If you enjoy the feel of laptop keyboards then this is a great option for a desktop keyboard.Pros: Slim keyboard, sturdy feel, looks great, small footprint, once configured correctly it is near flawless.Cons: Software issues, frequent battery changes, mouse needs to be fussed with in the charging cradle, bluetooth connection issues, advanced BIOS knowledge needed for control of BIOS system menus (normal for wireless/usb keyboards and mice)",0

3569,"WELL BUILT, NICE SOUNDING RADIO BOOMBOX. Well built, great sounding radio. Sony got smart and left out the ancient tapedeck, and saved buyers extra cash. I did not buy this radio boombox for the radio only for cd-mp3cd-mp3 capabilities. I have had no problem with ZS-H10s radio tuner. The sony zs-H10CP has a storage compartment in the back to store its large ac cord or even an ipod. This boombox has an outlet for ipods. This boombox plays mp3 cds and has mp3 cd tagging. The hc-H10cp reads mp3 cds with ease,Sony has probably worked out the id tagging kinks with mp3 cds in this boombox. The large ac power cord can be an eyesore, but is needed to power this boombox up. Large volume control and easy to use buttons on the zs-H10cp console make this boombox a pleasure to use. I just wish Sony included a remote. The zs-H10CP has a nice heavy basey sound, that sounds larger and heavier than other boomboxes. This radio was meant to be used at a worksite, not really to carry around, but you could if you like. I had the jvc kaboombox back in 1998, it was a nice sounding radio but a monster at 27 pounds to carry around. Clearly  for all its weight and size the jvc kaboombox should have more volume for all its 27 pounds. The sony zs-H10CP at much less weight is a nice sounding simple boombox",0

3571,"Worked great for me. OK - here's what you get:1 power supply brick1 iPod dock1 3-foot cable to connect power supply brick and dock1 3-foot cable to connect dock and stereoThis version of the kit is compatible with 3rd and 4th generation iPods (those with a dock connector on the bottom) and with the iPod mini. Although the dock connector is electronically the same for all these iPods, the dimensions of the iPod itself differ by model. Thus, the dock comes with different plastic tops for the different sizes of iPods and you snap on the right-sized top for your iPod (check the size carefully before snapping on the cover - it goes on easily, but it doesn't come off easily).The cable that connects the power supply brick and the dock is a special Apple firewire-to-iPod-dock cable, but the cable that connects the iPod and the stereo system is nothing special, just a standard stereo minijack plug on one end and two rca phono plugs on the other. You can get a compatible cable from many different vendors and in many different lengths; which in my case was a good thing because the 3-foot length in the kit was too short.Is the kit a good buy? Well, it depends. If you price all of the components in the kit separately, you will find that the kit is cheaper than the individual parts, even if you have to replace the stereo cable as I did. But, the question is, do you need to buy all the parts. Let's assume for the moment that you do in fact want to attach your iPod to your stereo and consider what you might be able to do without:(1) Power supply brick. Your iPod and dock will in fact work fine without being plugged into the power supply. The trade-off is that without it you will drain the battery of the iPod while it is plugged into your stereo. You can get a dock and a stereo cable for substantially less than this kit, so if you're OK with the battery issue, you can save money by not getting the kit.(2) iPod dock. You can plug the iPod into the stereo without the dock. The same stereo cable that connects the dock to the stero will also connect the iPod to the stereo. There are two disadvantages to this: first, the dock gives a true line-out, meaning that the volume control on the iPod doesn't affect the volume coming out of the dock, so you just use the stereo's volume control to control the playback volume. The audio-out jack on the iPod, however, is affected by the iPod's volume control, so if you connect it to the stereo, you have to be careful about the fact that there are two volume controls in the system, which is annoying at best, and there might be some risk to your stereo if the iPod's volume is too high. It is also worth noting if you have a power supply brick, you do not need the dock to recharge your iPod - the brick can plug into the iPod directly. If you are OK with the audio-out thing (and whether and how to keep your iPod upright without it) you can save money by not getting the kit and doing without the dock.(3) Power-supply brick to dock cable. If you don't have the brick, you don't need the cable; if you do have the brick, you need the cable or the brick isn't going to do you any good. If you have decided you can do without recharging the iPod while it is connected to your stereo, you can skip the brick and this cable both.(4) Dock-to-Stereo cable. This is the thing you can't do without if you want to connect your iPod and your stereo, but you have a lot of choices on vendors if this is all you're getting. Even if you aren't getting a dock, the cable that would connect the dock to the stereo is the same one that would connect the iPod to the stereo directly.One more thing to consider is that your iPod might have already come with one or more of these pieces, and if you aren't using them elsewhere, you could use them as part of your stereo set-up and just buy any other pieces you need and not get the whole kit.For me, I didn't have any extra pieces and I wanted the works - to recharge  the iPod and not have to worry about a double volume control, so I got the kit. I also got the NaviPod IR Remote (which you can get right here at Amazon) so that I could control it remotely like the rest of my stereo gear.To make your decision, just figure out what you want to have, what pieces you have already, and what you might be willing to live without and then make your decision. Hope this was helpful",0
3572,"Great Design, Powerful Learning Function. This remote has outstanding ergonomics!!!  It has a nice compact shape that is comfortable and balanced to hold.  When held naturally, the volume buttons and channel buttons are in the ideal location. (which is important since they are so freqently used)  However, the menu select button is a bit too small and the play/ff/rev buttons could have had a slightly better layout.  Despite this the rubber buttons have a comfortable and grippy feel, and the labelling of the numbers buttons are very legible.The programmable learning function is very simple to use, and worked great for me, even with the very rare asian brand DVD player I had.  I use it to control my TV, DVD Player, VCR, and Stereo surround system with no hassles at all.If you want a great, inexpensive compact programmable remote, this is it.  It is very powerful for the price! I think it allows you to string combinations of commands together, but I have not used this function.It doesn't have dedicated buttons for eject, next chapter, or slow motion, so if you want lots of dedicated buttons, look for a larger remote, but I easily programmed these functions onto some of the other available buttons, so this remote does everything I want it to.I am afraid it will be discontinued, and I like it so much I am buying another one.",0
3573,"Greatest iPod Accessory Ever!!!. I bought this monster link about a month ago.  I can honestly say that I haven't watched a bit of regular cable tv ever since.

The image quality is standard and honestly, I wasn't expecting HD images here.  I was actually shocked at certain tv shows like 30 Rock and Heroes where the quality seemed almost equal to standard tv viewing.  Overall, I can't say anything negative about this monster link.

Setup was very straight forward and easy to comprehend. Once completely setup, I popped in a DVD and although it took a couple seconds longer then other DVD players, playback was immediate and flawless. The unit can also be controlled by my SONY STR-DE598 remote with NO programming right out of the box!! So now I can control both with one remote, much to my wife's delight.

3578,"1st impression: Highly pleased; 2nd impression; hate it!  PS: I rate it only 1 star; not 4!. I had a succession of ultrasonic humidifiers from Sharper Image over the years which were fabulous for conditioning a dry room for a singer.  However, there were always two big drawbacks: (1) they'd leave white dust everywhere unless you used distilled water in them; and (2) if you let them run after the water emptied, it'd burn out the fan and then the unit would have to be replaced.However, ultrasonics are so much better for the voice than standard cool or warm humidifiers, so when Sharper Image recently stopped making this, I looked elsewhere and found the model above from Vicks.  Since I know to use only distilled water, the dust thing isn't an issue.  My initial impression was one of being very impressed by the significantly greater volume of cool mist it pushed out, and it did so essentially silently.  Also it has a far greater storage capacity than the old Sharper Image model, so it needn't be refilled as often.That idyllic image lasted for my first two hours of use.  Then I turned it off to go to lunch.  When I turned it back on an hour later, surprise, surprise, no mist would come out.  It just plain DIED!  I then called the 800 number (which was staffed by some people who had absolutely no - I mean ZERO - prior familiarity with the product), and the only tip I got was from their voice mail which said to unplug the unit for one hour so it could ""re-set"" itself.  I did so, but after replugging it, still no luck.Can't ANYONE make one of these that is reliable?  Vicks sure hasn't",0

3581,"Excellent Radio for the price. I was looking for a high quality portable that I could use at work and that was light enough that I could carry around with me while walking.I have had the E10 for about two weeks and am very pleased with it thus far. FM reception is very good -- it matches my Sangean ATS 818 easily. AM reception is also good (altough reception is compromised at work- but this is true of any radio). Shortwave is not quite to the same level as my Sangean but it still very good especially for the price and size. Sound is surprisingly good for the size of the speaker.My biggest complaint with the radio is the small size of the buttons and controls. Even as small as the radio is, it is clear that they could have designed it with larger and more well spaced buttons.The E10 comes with rechargeable NIMH batteries, the only drawback is that they only charge when the radio is OFF. The radio will work with standard AA batteries as well. An AC adaptor/charger is included. It also comes with ear buds (For FM Stereo) and a windup shortwave antenna.

I even purchased a ""virtual"" number to use between locations that I can access without a router/adapter.  My family can call me no matter where I am in the world as a local call to them. I tried Skype and was very disappointed, but Vonage is worth it to keep in touch with my family.  And being able to have a regular phone like the V-Tech is great because I don't have to wrestle with a headset or earpiece.  For me it makes being on the road or deployed like being at home",0

3588,"A good product. I used this mount to hang a 42"" panasonic TV.  The product was shipped in a good package.  It is a solid piece and it holds my TV up securely (I was initially apprehensive of hanging it but the moment I felt the solid stainless steel bar my mind was at ease).  It is deceptively heavy so it is critical to mount it on 2 studs.  However, the tv does slide a bit on the bar so you can sift it to the right/left by a few inches.The only area that I felt was lacking was a bit of clarity in the instructions.  You have to read a few sections a couple of times to ensure that you have interpreted the instructions correctly",0

3590,"GET RID OF THOSE COVERS!!!. My wife came up with the idea of placing all my DVDs in binders...I rejected the idea at first, but then saw her point about how our family room started to look like a video store.Now our shelves have more space and doesn't look so awkwardly colorful--the binders actually match the color scheme of our house!I know the other review mentions that the binder doesn't stay closed, but that's only if you fill each page with two DVD discs--meaning every DVD the other reviewer has is a two-disc set.  If you fill the binder up to its capacity, I can see that happening--but if you just have your average stack of DVDs, this is the product for you!The best thing about these binders:  It's highly unlikely anyone will ask to borrow a DVD--especially those ""never-bring-them-back"" friends!  Without the covers, they can't!Five Star product...all the way",0

Service: Ordered the sticks on Thursday, recieved them on Monday!Performance: Used these to boost my RAM to 1.5 Gig (previously had KVR400X64C3AK2/512 in my system, which is the little brother to this set).  All were recognized at boot-up and has markedly increased my performance (some apps boot up in half the time previously!).  Need to test further, but so far, so good!",0
3592,"Great TV/Monitor. I did some extensive research on TVs, and after several months of comparisons between Sharp and Samsung, I finally decided to purchase this set. After owning the set for a few days, I don't have a single regret.The brightness of the screen is more than sufficient, and I actually have to dim the screen a bit for comfortable viewing. The contrast is better than any other 32"" television I've seen in stores - in fact, because this set is a new model, I had actually never even seen one in a store before purchasing it from Amazon, but I bought it based on the specs, and it more than surpassed my expectations. There are multiple quick picture settings to choose from (including one user pre-set), so it's easy to change the brightness or contrast depending on what you're watching, which is extremely convenient for anyone who plans on connecting this to a computer, as I made my custom pre-set a much lower brightness so that I can quickly dim the screen when I switch from watching TV to using the computer.This set makes for a fantastic computer monitor (as long as you're not too close). The resolution is more than adequate to read small text, watch video clips, or look at/edit photos. There are also several buttons on the top of the unit which the pictures on Amazon do not show, making it very easy to select which input you want without having to use the remote. I couldn't get my computer to display wide-screen without stretching the image, but I'm not sure whether that's because of the TV or my graphics card. However, when I change the TV's screen ratio to 4:3 from 16:9, it still leaves me with a 26"" standard screen, which is more than sufficient.I use this set with an A/V receiver with surround sound, so I could care less about the TV's built-in speakers, but when I tested them, I was very surprised at the quality, especially given their size and wattage. If you plan on using the sound from the TV, I doubt you'll be disappointed, but I think it's almost shameful to own a television this nice and not invest on some sort of sound system.Overall, this TV is amazing and worth every penny, especially when you look at the price of older models and those from different manufacturers",0
3593,"This thing is amazing. I'm a cow and like most cows I use Photoshop heavily. All I can say is that I can not believe that I went as long as I did without this tool. Other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes.One thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode. I use a 24"" Dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and I was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration. Wacom definitely did their homework.To be honest I found it to not be that useful in 3D Max, but in Photoshop it's a WMD",0
3594,"Nothing too special, but serves its purpose. We didn't expect this item to revolutionize the way we us our iPod minis, but it does what it should - protects the unit from getting too beat up. The main things you look for on these is access to ports (which is pretty good, but not great); ability to use your controls (which is fine); protection of the unit - especially the screen - from damage (pretty good). Though the screen isn't fully covered, the added depth of the area around it makes it a bit tougher to damage (the screen isn't flat along the same plane as the rest of the unit, as it would be without this extra ""skin"" layer).The biggest negatives in my view are that you cannot use the standard ""clip"" to attach your iPod to a pocket or belt with this - it has a lanyard attachment instead. The access to ports for connecting accessories isn't perfect, so keep in mind the different attachments you'll want to be connecting and consider how this might get in the way of their connecting. But like I said, it serves the ""protection"" purpose pretty well, but you shouldn't expect it to be super-special and accomodate everything you may want to do with your iPod",0

I ran the same course 11 times and it gave identical distance readouts each time, regardless of weather conditions and the fact that I live in a densely housed area.The Heart Rate Monitor is extremely accurate, and the options for viewing data on the screen are practically endless.  With the ease of viewing what you want, the reliability of the GPS, the hundreds of options for data to record and monitor, the training partner and training features, the heart rate monitor - and all the other options I must give this 5 stars.

We have it hooked up to a Cox Cable HDTV set-top box, which includes a PVR feature, and our sound system. It's probably got the best tv picture we have ever seen. The HDTV channels look like a picture postcard, almost 3-D. The standard definition digital tv channels are very good.

This pad works better than either the Pelican Eclipse or Soul that I own.  My Madcatz Lynx is better, but way too big for my hands.  I like the feel of the plastic.

If you know someone that likes to play with silly things then this is perfect! They have a great 'feel' to them.. they're not like the regular 'globe' stress relief balls that we're so used to getting... these balls turn color and expand out of your hand as your squeeze them. Watching them turn different colors is lots of fun. (It seems that each ball has two colors - You see the main color when it's not being squeezed and the second color when you squeeze it) The balls are great as stocking stuffers too - but you might have to take them out of the packaging to fit it in the stocking. Happy Squeezing,0
3609,"Great for teachers on the go!. Currently, I am a student teacher at a high school that is not equipped with much in the way of high technology. I have struggled with the fact that the most advanced permanent piece of technology in the classroom was a slide projector (yes, SLIDES) that I had to dig out of my parents' garage. Coming right out of the university, I was used to making presentations utilizing the Internet and Powerpoint. It had been my hope that with my first teacher paycheck (a year later, that is) I would be able to purchase a multimedia projector for classroom use. To my great surprise, my parents were able to pick up the PowerLite S4 at an Office Depot for a very good price, and gave it to me as a gift for Christmas. Being a student teacher, I am forced to move around from class to class. This is where I have found the S4 to be very able. The S4 is, as the name implies, very light. If my hands were a big larger, I would easily be able to pick it up with one hand and have no problems. While it is certainly not the highest powered projector on the market today, it certainly throws out quite a bright image. The color is vibrant and can be seen when all the light banks are on in the classroom. I prefer to have the lights off, obviously, but lights on does not destroy the image. The S4 offers many different inputs, but the projector supplies only one with the product. Another feature that I enjoy is the time it takes for cool down. As a teacher on the go, I need to be packed up and ready to move on in about 5 minutes. The S4 cools down fast, which is definitely attractive. The sliding door for the lens is very nice as well. One of the only negative experiences I've had with this projector is that I have found that the projector must be hooked up to the computer before the computer is turned on. Once I figured that out, I have not had any trouble. For teachers and presenters on the go, I highly recommend this projector",0

3611,Reliable Affordable QoS router. This is a great router for the price. It's easy to configure and the documentation is pretty good. It explains the routing pretty well. What sets this router apart from others is the quality of service settings (QoS) that allow you to prioritize ports for bandwidth usage. You can set your streaming music or game ports to use a high priority and thus never get cut off by maxing out your bandwidth. This alone makes it worth the price.One thing to note: if you're on a Mac and try to configure this router through safari (It's web page configuration) it won't work because of a bug in safari. Use Firefox and you'll be golden.(Yes it works on Macs.,0

3619,"Superior value. Although HP LaserJet 13X (Q2613X) costs about 20% more than LaserJet 13A (Q2613A), it is a superior buy for a number of reasons. Topping the list is lower cost per page. 13X can print 4000 pages at 5% page coverage (ISO/IEC 19752 standard) whereas 13A can print 2500 pages. That's 37.5% difference in page yield. Divide up the toner price against 4000 (e.g., 91.99 / 4000 = 2.3 cents) to get cost per page.Secondly, laser toners last a long time whether you print few times a month or dozens of pages a day (they don't dry out). And finally, higher page yield means fewer toner replacement.My only complaint with 13X (and that goes to 13A as well) is that page yield cost with some competing printers and higher-end HP LaserJets is even less",0

I haven't had any problems with the dirt or the corners peeling or anything at all (just make sure you clean it well before applying).

They grow up so fast... but I digress.I took it down to the beach yesterday on a trip with my wife.  As we passed billboards along the route, I recorded the phone numbers and descriptions of properties for sale and rent.  As we inspected a few vacation rental places for this summer's potential vacation spot, I recorded our first impressions as we walked throughout the beach houses and condo/apartments. That made it easy when we had questions after we got back into the car about what rooms had KingSize beds and which had smaller bads, etc. It would have been too much trouble to write all hse comments down on paper.Not much to say about the recorder other than it works as advertised and you can use it out of the box without reading a lot of instructions.

It works well with my Dell 6000 laptop. I don't have a cable connection but I imagine the picture would be gorgeous if I did. I've backed up videos from my VCR and DVD to my PC with excellant video quality. It comes with RCA and S-video jacks for easy recording and can be connected coaxially for cable. I've travelled and viewed local tv with reception that varied according to the location (understandably). I had to buy an external mini antenna seperately to realize good reception while travelling. PIP only works with one LIVE broadcast and a STORED video that's already on your PC. It's a PCMCIA card and only laptops come with that slot so it should be assumed that the user would be utilizing the product while travelling or away from home so an antenna and FM radio reception should be standard with the product. I love it and my friends love it. For $75 it beats the $200 that I spent on the Pinnacle MovieBox two years ago for recording to my PC and this has a built in TV and needs no connection to AC power,0

The chargeable battery is worth it's weight in gold. This is by far the best remote I've ever own. The only complant is that some of the buttons on the bottom of the remote are quite small and tough to reach. Especially the ""page up"" and ""page down"" buttons.

3642,"Great radio, Fantastic price!. This review is for the silver model @ $35.00. I could not belive the price & had to get one & see what was up. I think mine is a floor demo as the tape sealing the box had been broken.The radio is in perfect condition, all functions work fine, all origonal packaging. I recommend this buy for as long as it will last, it is a great price. I enjoy this radio more than my other portables as the sound is much better & I like twisting knobs.",0
3643,"Good all around headphones. PROS:* Modern, simplistic design* Great sound, unexpected from $ 20 headphones* Snug fit, doesn't fall off of head, great for joggers* Neodymnium magnets deliver powerful bass* Cord is just the perfect length, unlike other Sony headphones [*cough* MDR-Q55SL *cough*]CONS:* Fit may be tight for people with a taller build* Tends to pinch ears* Neckband gets in the way when you turn your headThese are very good headphones for bargain hunters or people who are active.  People with taller builds or bigger heads may want to look elsewhere.  But, I feel that the pros far outweigh the cons, especially at this price point",0
3644,"Great Cable. This cable does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I previously had a Boston Acoustic PV1000 sub hooked up with a cheap cable but always had problems with the bass sounding ""boomy"".  I just replaced the cable w/ this one from monster and regret that I didn't do it earlier.  My sub finally sounds the way it should.  I actually had the floor rattling until my wife came down from upstairs because she couldn't hear the tv up there.  If you have a decent home theatre system spend $30 for this cable, you won't be disappointed",0
3645,"Excellent product. I've owned this item for almost a full year and I am extremely pleased with it. It's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag. The side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small, but I guess I'll be able to find a purpose for them.",0
3646,"GREAT PRODUCT!. I own a recording studio in my home and wanted to unclutter my space.  This monitor mount was the perfect complement to my situation.  Sturdy and easy, sraight forward install are words I would use to describe my experience.  I would highly recomend this product.",0

3648,"Good choice - Does not require included CD on newer Win 2000 or XP. From appearances and description, this appears to be identical to my SDDR-92 (no A15) except for the shape of the button.This SanDisk is an excellent unit - compact and reasonably slim, with a detachable USB cord.  It is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case (unlike my Dazzle which is fine for a desk top, but awkwardly shaped for compact storage).The unit is reliable and fast, and, unlike the 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters, this unit only uses one hard-drive letter.  It supports reading, writing, deleting, etc., and works with either USB 2.0 or USB 1.1.If you do not care about the button software, this unit installs plug-n-play, without needing a driver CD (at least on Win 2000 and XP).  It simply appears as a removable hard-drive letter in Explorer.I did not install the button software because I am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer.  I would rather be in full, manual control of how and when things happen, and where files are put.I think that this is a 5-star unit, but I downgrade my own unit to 4 1/2 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions.  In both the instructions, and on a sticky label on the unit (which I still have not been able to fully remove), it proclaims that you MUST install the button software before connecting the unit.  I ignored that warning, and the unit worked fine without any installation needed.One of the important requirements in a card reader is portability.  Since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer, the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the USB port.  The SanDisk SDDR-92 meets this requirement, although it proclaims not to.This is a good choice for a CompactFlash Reader/Writer.",0
3649,"Perfectly reliable, perfectly priced. Needing a quick &amp; dirty home network solution, I quickly decided on the Netgear switch.  All five ports are switched 10/100, half or full duplex, auto-negotiate.  After several months of use, I'm happy to say my Netgear switch has never burped once, and blazes as fast as I can ask",0
3650,"Sounds Great!!!. Simply fantastic sound for two channel audio from a computer. This card is best suited for playing music from your computer over your stereo / home theater system. Most 2-channel computer speakers will require an adapter or new cable to use the RCA output jacks. Worth the trouble for the sound you'll get out of a decent pair of computer speakers.Has a very high quality D/A converter built in for making digital recordings from vinyl or tape. Recordings sound excellent. Output sounds excellent through either the coaxial digital or analog outputs. Dolby Digital can be automatically passed through the digital output to be decoded by your A/V receiver.Had no problems with the installation or functioning of this card in Windows XP Pro.Completely destroys the Audigy 2 it replaced for music. 128 KB MP3 internet radio even sounds awesome through this card. Clean, dynamic and smooth sound. Very pleased with this purchase!!",0

3654,"Great product. The Macally PHR-100AF FireWire External Enclosure is a great product, very easy to assemble, plugs-in via firewire and appearson your desktop just as any external hard drive would.I bought two this product as a way of salvaging a couple of internal hard drives that I had previously installed as upgrades in my Mac that I was replacing. They have both worked flawlessly now for two months and I would unhesitatingly reccommend them to others as a great solution for this kind of situation.",0
3655,"Needs to be packaged better, but a great value. Positives:  Parts all labeled clearly; the little pieces were all in individual bags and labeled with the letter matching the instructions (instructions say use a ""K"" screw, then open the ""K"" baggie); predrilled holes were all spot on and everything fit correctly upon completion; quick and easy to construct; spins solidly and smoothly; instructions were clear and simple; I think it looks good.Negatives:  Due to inadequate protection, all four of the vertical side panels had a scratch of some nature on them; one of the shelves had a chip in the corner, even though those boards were wrapped; had to wipe down all the boards to clean off this grayish residue off them here and there.Overview:  It's not furniture grade, it's just laminated pressboard (1/2 in. for the sides, top and bottom plates; 3/8 in. for the middle shelves and dividers).  But in context of the price (something like $35 delivered), it's an outstanding value.  The marks, other than the chip in the shelf, are not visible from the couch, and it looks good otherwise.  The color is a brown, but a dark brown.  Sits on my black shelving fine.FYI:  each of the eight shelf spaces are 10 3/4 inch wide by 8 1/4 inch tall.Bottomline:  If I had to redo my purchase, I'd buy this product again",0

3657,"Perfectly fits all DVDs in little space. I was at first hesitant to buy this because I have shelves full of DVDs, but my sister has one and told me I would fall in love with this case and its true. I bought two. If you want to watch a good movie and dont want to carry 10 DVDs in your hand to show your friends/family, this case is easier, because you just carry this and you have all your DVDs available.Its heavy, but come on, who said DVDs are light! Its absolutely perfect.I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to downsize their walls of DVD...At first its hard to part with the cases, but in the end, if you end up moving, you dont have to box up over 50 boxes, only a big book.It takes little space and is very sturdy. Even has extra space for more DVDs if you have extras to place.I only bought two cases, but plan on buying more for more movies that I end up buying.Enjoy your new DVD case, you will love it",0

I have the OLYMPUS C8080, and at the highest-quality camera settings, I can get 254 color shots from this card. SimpleTech is my favorite brand, because I've never had any of their cards fail on me, even after repeated washings. Oops.This CF Card is totally dependable. SimpleTech is pricey, but you're paying for quality, which is cheaper in the long run.",0
3660,Great Screen. It works great and we have had no problems with it. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a pull-down projector screen.,0
3661,"Good product at great price. The USB cable looks and feels very similar to the apple one, but the chargers have a somewhat cheesy feel. Then again, that's totally to be expected when you buy a whole set for less than half the price of a cable or either charger alone from Apple or one of the name brand companies.I also should note that the AC adapter is 100-240v compatible, so it can work worldwide. I was wondering about that when I bought it because none of the tech info mentioned it. In fact, the casing itself was designed to be used with the EU style plugs, and that's why it protrudes from the body of the case.Also, the items I received look like the submitted picture, and not the MFG's picture, for what it's worth... Doesn't matter much because in any case the items aren't very aesthetically pleasing anyways.Bottom line, from reading the other reviews it looks like they have QC issues, but I wound up with a perfectly functional set at a great price",0

3664,"The ultimate running companion. As an aspiring triathlete and self-admitted gadget freak, I'm always looking for something new to track my progress.  This little device is fantastic.  I was contemplating upgrading my Polar HRM to the one with the ""footpod"" that tracks speed/distance - but I'm glad I bought this instead.  Pro's and con's:Pro's:1.  INCREDIBLY easy to use, program, and manipulate.  My overriding thought since I got it has been that Polar could learn alot from Garmin.  I've had my Polar S450 for 3 years and still can't get it to do everything it's supposed to.2.  Lightweight, wristwatch style configuration is imperceptible while wearing it.  In fact, it's lighter than my Polar HRM, which I wear on the other wrist.3.  Incredibly accurate.  Used it while biking the other day...distance and other measurements were right on with my cyclocomputer.4.  Very user-friendly software interface, and uploading a run takes seconds, without any additional user involvement other than plugging it into the computer.5.  Price - very, very reasonable.Con's:Only one, and it's a stretch...can't use it while swimming.  As a triathlete, I would have liked to be able to accurately measure my distance & speed during open water swims.Now I kinda wish I'd bought the 405 (with built in HR monitor).  Maybe when the Polar wears out!  A great tool and terrific value",0
3665,"Duracell batteries DO have energy!. Its true these battery do have energy inside them, its another marvel of modern science. Personally I noticed that the flow of electrons were very strong, a nice change after years of dealing with batteries that only had strong to moderately strong electron flow. You mainly notice this when you bridge the terminals with your mouth (dont try this at home, well, actually if you do try it, it will probably be at home. But dont try it at WORK you will look like an idiot)I did notice however that the longer I left the battery bridged in my mouth the less painfull it became, this was over a period of like 3 days straight though which was promising. At first I didn't know if it was just my nerve endings getting fried off or if this behemoth of a battery was actually losing power. But after a couple more days I started to regain feeling in my lower lip and I knew the ride was almost over and the battery was indeed growing weeker. Overall this was the longest lasting battery I have personally experienced. I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for adventure",0
3666,"Works fine. It does have a short cord, but long enough to reach the front of an older desktop computer with USB 1.1 connections only on the back.  Short cord could be a plus for laptops: Less tangling",0
3667,"The only product worth my time for writing a review. This is the best mouse EVER by FAR . I owned the original one and it worked flawlessly for over 5 years(and if someone hadn't cut the cord I would still be using it today). As a responce to the users that are less than absolutly satisfied; I will agree looking at their perspective. Smaller hands may find that pressing the two side buttons by accident is as easy as pressing them intentionally, and the scroll wheel is notched deeper than most. Both of these features are intentional. This is not by any means a particularly big mouse but it may be a good idea to go into a local retail store just to make sure that you are comfortable holding it. If your thumb does not naturally rest on the side buttons then don't think and buy this absolutely superior mouse",0
3668,Adequate Case; Could be a little better. Used with iPod 20g Color 4g: For the money this case provides adequate protection and a very little outer zipper pouch for earBuds that shipped with your iPod. I leave my Skin on my iPod and it fits very snugly. With two zippers to access the iPod storage area you'll have the ability to plug-in your earbuds and close with just stem and cord exposed. Unfortunately you must remove the iPod to adjust playing features. Has a built in belt-loop (no snaps) to securely attach to belt. Enjoy!,0
3669,Great Printer and Scanner Combo. This printer has excellent photo quality and the side benefit I never anticipated was the incredible ease of use to scan and print documents. The menu wheel feature is too easy! I can scan and print in less then a minute. Canon printers come with great monitoring and application software. That's one reason I switched from years of HP printers,0

3673,"The Best Case available for the video iPod. I just received this case from amazon through amazon marketplace with iskin inc. I absolutely love the case. The case covers every part of the ipod, including the docking port on the bottom. The actual silicon on the ipod is extremely durable, and has holes on the back of the iPod to keep the ipod from being overheated. On the front of the case, a scratch resistant VISOR which does not shift in place. This sllows protection of the front of the ipod, including the screen and the click wheel. The click wheel is protected by a thin membrane, but its a little rough so it might time to get used to.My only complaint is the cover on the docking port. The docking port is covered by a piece of silicon which is attached to the rest of the case. This makes it really difficult to insert the iPod onto the universal dock, seeing how the dock connector cover isn't really removable. I have emailed iskin about this problem.I believe the iskin is THE case to get for the ipod. Its durable, stylish, pretty, and is definately worth the $35",0
3674,"Photos that truly look and feel professional. This printer produces 4X6 prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab.  The quality is fantastic, and the relatives were in awe.  I am very very happy with the printer and the Canon S400 camera I use it with.  I now have a portable print studio.  Do not confuse this printer with ink jet printers.  It uses dye sublimation, a completely different printing process.  The result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard, not a piece of paper.  You don't put ink in it, so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer.  You buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from Canon.  (KP-36IP, for example",0
3675,"coolest product. I used these as thank you cards, and they were a huge hit! I just sent thank you postcards to everyone, with a picture of us and our new house and everyone thought they were the best idea!!!  (plus the stamps for postcards are cheaper!!)  I give it an A++++++++++",0

3677,"Good for Windows Media Center PC owners. I've had my PMC-120 for a little over 1 month and am pretty happy with it.  There are a few features Microsoft could have improved:  user customizeable EQ, more than one playlist that can be created on the device, last playlist recall when returning to music (from video or TV).  Overall the unit functions well and is great for taking all my media on the road with me.  Once Windows Media Player is configured on my PC, all my synchronized recorded TV content is converted in the background before I wake up in the morning.  Before I leave, I just plug in and sync for a minute or so and I'm good to go.  The only other nit-pick I would have is that the processor or I/O performance seems to be an issue when loading the album cover for tracks.  For example, if I change to the next track and increase the volume, the volume response can take 2 - 3 seconds while the album cover is loaded.  This can be a little irritating sometimes when I want to skip through several tracks.  In spite this, I like the unit and I'm happy to have it.  Maybe MS/iRiver will provide a firmware update to address the lack of features above",0
3678,"It's a porsche,, sleek and fast,, with some extra's.. I bought this external unit for the lightscribe technology, and it works great.  Very nice appearance and runs quiet.  I like to make custom CD's for ""traveling"" music, with the selection of songs I want to hear.  AND, the software included with this unit makes that so easy, gathering songs from whatever location they are stored and putting them in the order I want.  Then, it goes directly to some very nice templates for printing a cover, or booklet, for the CD case.  And that's just one program.  There's also a program for seting up the label to burn directly on the lightscribe disc's.  It's a little harder to learn, but it also has some great features.  I can select an image from my documents and use that as a background for the face of the CD.  I wish the image would burn a little darker on the CD, but that's the technology and not the fault of the  LaCie burner.  I HAVE tried burning it twice, same image, Yep it will work, and makes it a little darker.  Takes over 30 minutes to burn at the ""best"" image, and about 12 minutes at the ""medium"" setting.  I'm happy with the purchase from Amazon, both price, service, and delivery.",0
3679,"Does the job. It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue).",0

3684,Very Impressive!. I came in contact with the Bose speakers when my brother and I ran a movie on dvd for a group of young people at our church meeting house. My brother brought his new Sharp projector and we set up a 10 foot beaded screen. BUT there was a short in the church's sound system and we were in big trouble. Nice picture but poor sound. My brother brought out his Bose speakers and I shook my head. Too small and not enough power for the cultural hall that we were using. Turned out they worked marvelously well! I have now purchased a pair for myself to use with my computer and to take with me when teaching classes require the use of a projected dvd. I am very pleased with them and would highly recommend them,0
3685,"Awesome labels. Nothing is worse than poorly applied CD labels or hand written text with a Sharpie.  Lightscribe is an awesome technology to ""label"" CDs.

Highly recommend it if you are looking for a new computer or a separate burner.",0

I had previously owned a Canon printer that at the time was rated high and it served well but was old and photo quality was getting worse to the point where the wife was getting our photos developed elsewhere. After reading up on the newer printers I took our flash card to a store and tried it using the HP printer. To say that I was amazed would be an understatement. I went home and immediately ordered the printer and Amazon blew away the competition on price. When I got it I printed a photo that my wife had previously had developed at a shop and side by side she did guess which was which but it was close and she was just as amazed.I don't know all the technical stuff but I know if you are looking for a great photo printer for your home you'll have a hard time beating this one. Since we use the computer to fix and print photos I opted for the 7160 instead of the 7360, the screen on the printer was not a big deal to me since they are the same printer otherwise.If there is anything negative to say it would be that the advertised printing speed is not exactly accurate (at least not with the quality of photo I was printing) but then I don't think any printers are as advertised. Nevertheless, this is a winner",0

3701,"A great buy. The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it",0

It is giving excellent quaility in low light also.Make me look good (in the cam ;)) to my freinds and family.The driver software got along with the cam did not work on Vista, but then it was not difficult to get it online.I would defnitly recommend this. It is also good if you are using Business confrencing.It fits on the laptop like a part of it. The clip at the back is adjustable (expands) about 1/2 an inch, but if your minitor is really thin, it may not fit tight. But my guess is that it should be good for 99% of the laptops out there.I would not recommend this for Desktops unless you want to fix (glue) them on top of your monitor.",0

You know the difference in quality when you switch from watching regular tapes (vhs) to dvd?   Well, it is the same ""step"" when you watch dvds with s-video, as watching dvds with s-video.

3709,"Good performance at a good price. I bought this as a replacement for a Sony WM-FX788 AM/FM cassette player and recorder. When the 788 stopped working, I looked for a replacement and did not find one that would both play and record cassettes. I have since become much more satisfied with the 290 than I was with the 788 for several reasons: (1) The 290 uses direct mechanical actuation of the tape drive, rather than the electronic actuation of the 788. I regard this as an advantage, since the ultrasensitive switch that controlled the cassette drive in the 788 often resulted in it taking off at high speed in some unintended direction when all I wanted to do was stop it. The direct mechanical actuation of the tape drive means that I am never in doubt about what the machine is going to do when I press a button. I regard this as a desirable trade-off for the lack of an auto-reverse feature. (2) The AM and FM sensitivity is much better in the 290 - almost as good as my table radios. Its weather and TV band reception is adequate and is an occasionally useful feature. (3) The 290 uses a single AA cell, rather than the rechargeable, expensive, and hard to find proprietary battery in the 290. (4) The 290 is much cheaper - I paid about $180 for the 788. (4) The 290 is slightly larger than the 788, but is still a handy size for slipping in a pocket while exercising (my primary use). [To answer a point raised in the discussions: going from the tape to a previously tuned-in radio station takes only two button presses - one to stop the tape and one to turn on the radio.] I have other ways of making recordings, so not having this function in a radio and cassette player is no great loss. Overall, I rate the FX-290 as an excellent value",0

I bought these after buying TDK for the past 5 years and now only being able to get Memorex at a low price (I've had very bad experiences with Memorex CDRs in the past).

3719,"From a Musician. This is great way to get your vinyl on to a CD. You have to use 'music'labeled CD-R's though. Some of my jazz collection has not been reissued on CD, and I made CD copies for my car and golf cart.The CD quality is pretty good considering that you're not running it through an editing/pro-tools system. The record player itself does 33, 45 and 78' RPM's. It sounds as good, or bad, as any 1970's record player did. The recording is quite good and sounds even better when played back.This is a great gift for a parent or grand-parent who wants to convert their vinyl to CD.You must 'finalize' the CD before it will playback, so there's a small learning curve to using it. The auto tracks feature is nice, but doesn't work from live recordings at all. The tracks play sequentially and it doesn't affect the playback whether one song has 3 tracks or 1; It plays back just like the record did. The auto track mode just senses a dip in the volume, and encodes another track on the counter.It's worth the price for the convienence of it, and no computers are required to make it work.If you're a critical 'high-end audio-file type person', who spends $15K+ on playback equipment, you won't like it....wait to buy the remastered CD from the record comapany.",0

3721,"Why does Bose induce so many  contradictory  opinions?. I am not an audiophyle, just a music lover. My main system consists of Proac 140 speakers, MF x 150 amp and XRay cd coupled with PSU and MF DAC. I have a Michell Giro turntable. Whats this to do with Bose? may you ask. Well just intended to say that I am used to a middle range audio equipment with pedigree. It hapens that I spend many hours in a private office home, crowded with shelves, books and papers, so that I have no space to position box speakers. Recently I decided to purchase a Bose kit. My amp is a old Pioneer A 400, and a Marantz CD 76 MkII is my source.My previous speakers were a Solid Ovale set built by B&W. It produced a boxy sound without live or body. Then the Bose kitt was seted up. WOW...WOW. Now my office is full of a rich and involving sound, realistic and detailed. I cant undestand why are people saying there is no bass.... Well I have ears, and years of music listening experience. The results are amaizing. The most impressive is that  I have the sensation of presence of musicians performing in the room. Probably stereo image is a bit confusing as is the sound stage in the classical sense of  stereo speakers. However is what we got when listening music live. Can someone in a concert hall define the exact posittion of musicians while closing the eyes????. This one is a great speaker set. I cant talk about buid qualities or engineering. Honestly I do not care if this set is based on cheap componets as some argue, since I am much more concerned about its sound, and it sounds lovel",0

3723,"Great Fan. I purchased this fan because my sister got one first.  It was great!  The fan is extremely quiet and pushed plenty of air.  Best of all is the tallness of the fan.

3724,"perform well on what it is supposed to do. I am not sure what's the problem with the previous reviewer, but I found this protection pack works pretty well for me (I owned the one with 3 pieces including the exterior protection sleeve in addition to the keyboard cover and hand rest sticker). The hand rest sticker sheet fits the hand rest area very well so one can hardly noticed htere is a cover if not paid special attention to it which is good because I was worried the beauty of the MBP will be ruined by 3rd party protection sheet but obviously not in this case. The hand-rest protection sheet is also reversible (easy to peel off) and I was wondering why someone can't even stick something well and complained the bubble forming. It certainly won't be a issue if you try to stick it careful. (Imaging it as a big piece of sticker, if you are not careful, of course some bubbles might be formed, however, since this sheet can be peel off easily, if bubbles occur, you can just simply re-stick it.)The keyboard cover is nice too and work as a nice wipe to the screen, more over, it's washable, so if you found out the cover is dirty and starts transfering dirt to your screen (which is never the case for me, I don't know why somebody will be that careless to leave all kinds of dirt on your $$$ laptop???), you can simply wash it and it will be as clean again.Overall, I highly recommend this product if you are looking for some elegant MBP protection-ware.",0

I don't use it for college as it is a little too big for me for everyday use(but then, I'm about 5 feet tall). This is a great bag if you're planning on an overnight trip (or a week long trip) and don't want to be bothered with a lot of luggage. I like to take my laptop everywhere I go and this is the bag I take on my weekend trips. It keeps the laptop secure and there's plenty of room for a few sets clothes and other odds and ends. It does not have the plastic supporters that's shown in the picture. But it does have a small partition in the main compartment, which can hold a big book(you can push this partition back if don't want to use it).

This really works, and works well, from my PC computers.2. The control over what music is played, volume, etc. resides in your computer, not in the computer and the Airport.  This can make life simpler, much simpler, especially if anything does go wrong.Cons:1. Pricey, especially when you factor in the cable kit which you are going to need if you want to run sound from the Airport into your sound system via a digital (optical) cable (this requires a proprietary cable), or will probably want if you don't want to (1) scrounge for your own cables, or (2) plug directly into a wall outlet and run stereo (L and R only) into your amplifier.2. They don't tell you this in the manual, but you'll be better off assigning the Airport(s) to static IP addresses, and selecting improved robustness against interference",0

3731,"Now we're talking.... I read the reviews on Amazon and checked out the Olympus and other recorders...nothing touches this one for usability.  Therein lies some of the problem.  I'm a techie and still can't  use it in the dark when driving. As a master's student, it has proved invaluable in lecture.  On the (CONF-Hi) setting, it easily picks up even the whiniest professor's voice at a 15 foot range.  The main reason I purchased the ICD-BM1 was it's 5 Dragon award from Dragon Natually Speaking(DNS).  I use DNS v7.3 and have found it trained easily and has around 95% accuracy (down a few points from another reviewer) probably because I impatiently read the 1 hr training script in 40 minutes. It's very small and extremely light.  The case has two velcro'd places for additional memory sticks.  However, since it can use 128mb (not pro)I rarely swap sticks.  I use the 128 for class related info and the others for personal life - maybe that's why I rarely swap - I have no personal life.  One more thing, it's fabulous with DNS for dictating emails while driving.  This allows emailing to family friends that would otherwise not hear from me as often.  Great product!!!!PART TWO - 4 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASEWhen first setting up the unit I found the battery door was very difficult to get open - but dismissed it figuring how often would I be replacing batteries? It turns out the door has now become unstable and sits in a slightly open position, popping open at will. When the batteries come out unnoticed, I have to reset the date/time etc.After contacting Sony I learned that IF they determine it is a manufacturing defect versus user abuse, they will exchange the unit. The problem is... the unit received in exchange will not be new, rather it will be used (refurbished).A warranty should repair or replace with a new unit - especially manufacturing defects. I'm disappointed in Sony.Rather than do without the unit only to receive a used unit, I've decided to tape the door shut.",0

But I was a little unhappy with the Brenthaven Professional 17 because the laptop compartment was not as easy to use as other manufacturers.  It has a dual-flap system: unzip, then open the velcro flap.  So I began to try other manufacturers.  I tried pretty much everything, from Kensington, to Tumi, Lowepro, etc.  I liked the Kensington Contour line, but seemed a little bulky and not as rugged.  I was really happy with the Booq Python XL, until I started using it.  The zippers jammed and broke on the very first day of use!  Booq's customer service is deplorable, requiring the customer prove ownership by submitting pictures of the defective product (why couldn't I just send it in for replacement?)  So I decided to go back to Brenthaven.  I liked how this model had a new-style laptop compartment.  Well, I've been using it for a while.  It's by far the best, don't waste your time and money elsewhere.  The zippers are large coil-type and are easy to use and will not jam.  The laptop compartment is a cinch to use, just unzip and slip in the laptop.  It's well-protected by hard panels and soft foam.  The shoulder straps are contoured and comfortable.  There are even cell phone connector nubs on the straps (an undocumented feature!)  The material and construction is flawless, dependable, and well, the best!  If you do decide to get this one, I recommend you get it through Amazon, and not one of the other sellers here.  It's a little more expensive, but the shipping is so much better.  I have received many shipments from other sellers through Amazon, and they truly suck!  Sometimes I get stuff in a torn-up padded envelople, sometimes the item is crushed beyond belief, often the shipper takes a long time to get on the ball and ship!

Its interface is lovely and thoughtfully conceived, it weighs less than your checkbook, and it's surprisingly durable:  throw it around, let your Aunt Marge step on it, rub it with beef and give it to the dog for a while ... at the end it'll still work.All of that, and it costs less than a pizza.Back in 1972, Hewlett Packard released their HP-35 calculator (with the four standard arithmetic functions and twelve transcendental functions), and it cost $395.

That calculator changed the world, and now here's a calculator that leaves the HP-35 in the dust -- in terms of speed and functionality -- and at less than 1/100th the cost.Sure, there are lots of feature-rich calculators that you can buy in the check-out line at Walgreen's for only a few bucks, so you're probably wondering what makes this calculator so special.  If you consider (a) its price, (b) its feature set, and (c) its overall utility, this calculator is currently at the apex, folks.  By a *long* way.  And its been there for several years.  Speaking as a calculator snob, I'm usually unimpressed by anything less than a classic HP, but as far as the complete package goes, this calculator is surprisingly beautiful.  I own two of them; one to keep in my bookbag, and another one ""just in case"".With this guy, you're getting a lot of bang for very few bucks.  It might not graph, it might not perform symbolic math, it might not use RPN or have a precision-engineered keypad with double-injection-molded keys -- and above all it's certainly not a computer -- but it's currently the best value out there in utility scientific calculators and nothing else comes close.",0

3762,"great off air picture. I was really surprised with the off air reception.  One of the reasons I have not bought an HDTV is that the picture tends to appear less than impressive from most broadcast sources.

However, the printed alphabetic characters underneath each button will wear off in about 18 months, after which you haved to memorize which button corresponds to which alpahbet character.  Not as hard as you might think, but irritating.  Secondly, the watch case pin holes where the watch band pin attaches the band to the case will tend to erode or pull out over time.  I've had to replace one perfectly good watch because I couldn't get a replacement band to attach",0

3767,"Sweet little phone set. We have had these phones for a few weeks now, and have had no problems.  I really like the smaller size of the handset, and the beltclip allows my wife to plug in a hands-free headset.  The phonebook is accessable on both phones (no need for entering it twice) and the speakerphone works great.  We can set it on the counter and talk in a normal voice from several feet away and be heard easily.One handset has a very faint background ""static-noise"" but the other does not...could be the location of the phone in the kitchen with the base, or the outlet it is plugged in to.  We haven't bothered to switch it as it is hardly noticeable unless you are consciously listening for it",0

3771,"Patience during setup really pays off. This remote does its job well. I had eight remotes to control the gear in my living room, and this thing took the place of all of them. I no longer lose them in the couch or forget where I put them last...and it no longer takes me five minutes to set up just to watch a movie or listen to music. Macros allow one button press to turn on (or off) all required equipment and set them to the correct mode. The backlight is pleasant, I like the audio feedback of button presses, and the sheer size of the thing feels good in my hands and prevents misplacement.That being said, this thing was a royal pain to get working properly right out of the box. This may be because I have some less mainstream A/V equipment, but the previous reviews do not exaggerate the PC program interface with its endless mouse clicking. Even the so-called ""wizard"" has multiple mouse clicks for one simple button, which can get very tedious if you have a remote with 40 buttons on it, like for a reciever.Here's a recommendation: skip through the initial wizard as fast as you can, then make a new profile and start out in advanced mode. Even if you go through the wizard, most of your time will probably be spent in advanced mode anyway, because you have to tweak alot buttons to get them working. This may save you much time and headache. This is also where you program macros, the shining star of this remote.Software installation is straightforward. The interface, aside from the points mentioned above, is relatively simple. You can drag and drop components to pick the order you want them to show up on the screen. Everything is clearly labelled and easy to read. Macros are simple too, but only after you get the buttons working properly.It took me a couple of hours to get it to do all Dish Network remote commands. After manually programming each button for the DVR, I had to make a macro to get to ""My Recordings"" with one button press, and it took a few tries to get it to do page up and page down when browsing the guide.The remote itself has a nice finish, and weighs about like a largish paperback book in your hands. The touchscreen is large enough to poke at it without worrying about hitting the wrong button. The physical buttons are responsive and do not feel cheap or ""clicky"". After some use, fingerprints show up on the touchscreen, especially when eating popcorn. However, the display is bright enough when backlit that they aren't really a distraction. The menu tree is easy to learn and get used to as well.This remote would get five stars if it weren't for the subpar PC interface and sparse documentation. The actual remote is fantastic however, and well worth the time and effort it takes to get it up and running. Just make sure you burn a CD with a copy of your profile once you get it going!",0

3774,"Not bad for the price. I have used various other KVM's in the past ranging from home use to commercial applications, and this KVM for the price is quite good.  Switches between computers quickly and easily, audio sounds good (good enough for me), and it was a snap to hook up.  I love the built in cables and size of this unit. Its size makes it easy to hide on the already cluttered desk.  I just slapped a piece of Velcro to it and hung it on the back side of the desk.  My complaints are that the PS2 connecters seem to come loose from the unit quite easily, and that they are so close to the monitor connector that if you have a USB to PS2 converter you need to get a small pig tail extender.  One PC's video was a little off, but it has always done that no matter what KVM I have used (two different Belkin models in the past).  I use this between two desktop PC's.  One is dual booted with WinXP and Fedora, and the other PC is dual booted between Ubuntu and Fedora.  I have had no problems with any of the OS's picking up the mouse or keyboard.

3776,"Great Device - Confounding Instructions. I just got this iPod dock for my RX-V659. Popped it open. Plugged it in. And spent the next hour trying to figure out how to make it work! The instructions that come with it are really terse.  All they say is to plug it in and put your iPod in it. Perhaps I'm the only on who struggled with this set up. . but in the event that there are others, I thought I'd give some additional instructons.  Here are a few things you should know (that could save you an hour!).1. You have to program your Yamaha receiver's remote with a code in order to control the iPod. Instructions for this operation are in the way-back of your receiver's owner's manual.  Which has 3 separate sections on how to use an iPod. The first section for me was on p.24. The second somewhere around p. 100 and the third p. on 108. You need all three section to make it work!2. After you program the code. . .here's the tricky part.  .and I didn't see this in either the YDS-10 manual or the RX-V659 manual. . .here goes: The receiver's remote has a little switch on the right side that switches between ""Amp"", ""Source"" and ""TV"". If you just got your receiver, you may not even notice this switch.  But here's the tricky part.  The receiver won't control the iPod at all if this switch is in it's default position (""Amp""). You have to switch it to ""Source"". . and then low and behold. . .the amp says ""Loading"". . the iPod screen changes to a Yamaha logo. . .and you can see your song list on the TV screen!The sound quality is top notch! Hope this helps someone else!",0

After reviewing several buyer's feedback on purchases of 15"" LCD televisions, I was guided by the comments (both negative & positive) about several manufacturers and sellers of HDTV LCD televisions, I shied away from lower priced products because of the negative feedbacks detailing picture quality (or lack of) product operational failures,poor customer support on complaints, etc. The Sharp LCD TV is a quality product, and I'm glad I decided to buy Sharp. The retailer (Fry's electronics) provided excellent delivery service and accurate billing. I woul strongly recommnd to potential future buyers of LCD tv,s to stay with a quality maker such as Sony, Toshiba, Sharp or Samsung, etc. even though you may pay a little more than the cheap prducts on the market, because in the long run they won't regret it ! The bottom line is; Research thoroughly allproducts before buying. A bargain is not a bargain if in the long run you end up with more grief. Buying on the internet has greater risk factors versus walking into a retail store where the product can be returned if unsatisfactory.

3796,"A fine level of sound quality from ""tiny"". First, let me confirm the other reviewers comments that the color isn't as shown.  It's not, but it only matters if you're truly attempting to match to a specific pink shade.  They're pink, but it's a dark pink.What matters is that these tiny speakers sound reasonably powerful and accurate.  In general, larger speakers can move more air than small ones, so smaller ones have to work harder especially in the bass range.  These speakers are absolutely tiny, so to simply avoid sounding tinny, overstressed and distorted at moderate sound levels would be a victory.  The Vivid 60 does this quite well, producing low to moderate sound levels with reasonably wide range to be satisfying.  You can't expect a miracle with something this small, but look, these things actually have a hint of bass, and the mid and upper ranges are fairly smoothly reproduced.  Vocals are clean, and I haven't found any nasty resonances as I have with other plastic encased systems.  I doubt you'll do any better than these without going to a larger size, they are simply well optimized.  Treble dispersion is not great, so you'll want these close to you for best sound, within 3 or 4 feet and pointing directly toward you.  I bought them for my wife to use while she gets ready in the morning, and she's delighted, uses 'em everyday.  They fit easily on a small bathroom wall shelf among the many toiletries and perfumes, blending in as though they belong there.  They are usually driven by an iPod.  If you must have the smallest, this is definitely a good choice in a very small powered speaker.  Just pick your color",0

I have mine in living room since I sit closer to the TV there.  For my bedroom, which is larger and I'm further from TV, I'd probably go up to next largest size.  I love that this one is lightweight enough to move with ease ... by myself.  And it is a world of improvement if you are still watching TV on one of those large square box, heavy weight TVs.

The quality is perfect.What makes them even better is that on some Sony mini disc players you can use long play recording modes to record for 160 or 320 minutes.  My model is mzn 707 so I am sure all the newer models have this feature.This is handy because if you record a lot you run out of space very quickly. If you record live material onto your computer you use tons of space (about 20 mb a minute), which is a problem.Because the files are huge it is necessary to convert to mp3s. For this, I use Cool Edit 2000 available at www.syntrillium.com.If you do record a lot may I recommend you also check out the new 1gb minidisc for newer model players.With the new 1 gb 45 hour disc HI-MD mini disc it is now possible to get on one disc what I previously had to spread over 34 standard 80 minute discs. If I want, I can store about 900 songs, or 70 cd's, or save a whole year of voice lessons.For $6.99 for 45 hours, this is $0.15 per hour compared to about $1.50 per disc for the standard 80 minute discs, so the value is incredible.I highly recommend this.

3838,"Fantastic Tuner but Audiophiles beware. I had been researching HD Radio for some time and was eager to hear it but since no retail store seems to be able to actually demo the technology, I decided to purchase the HDT-1 from Amazon.  Great price.First off Amazon delivered the tuner in two business days - great job.  The HDT-1 is easy to set up, simple to use and nice to look at.  The remote works well.  I have not noticed the problem with the display being too bright although I have noticed the clock lagging behind.  Not a big deal.As for the technology, the tuner tunes beautifully.  I live outside of Washington DC in the Maryland suburbs and have had no trouble picking up all of the area radio stations and all with the strongest signal and in HD.  There are lots of HD channels and secondary channels and virtually all of them come in with the strongest signal using the supplied antenna.  As a comparison, the smooth jazz channel was inaudible on my regular stereo tuner but was crystal clear on the Sangean.  This is a great piece of technology.  But,As for sound quality, I was concerned about the compression codecs used in this technology.  I had read that HD radio encodes at 96kps and frankly this is what it sounds like.  While crystal clear, the music is a bit dull and lacking in energy.  It certainly is not ""CD quality.""  In my opinion, 96kps is too much compression for someone who is into sound quality.  I typically download my music at 256kps if not 320kps and there simply is no comparison in the quality of the mp3's streaming from ITunes wirelessly to the stereo and the HD radio direct connection.  The mp3's encoded at 256 or above are far superior in sound quality to the songs encoded for HD radio.  This is the unfortunate truth about HD Radio.  At this point, while it is superior to satellite radio in sound quality, it is not ready for prime time audiophiles.So, the Sangean HDT-1, while a great tuner, can only reproduce the quality of the radio source that goes into it.  Thus, Audiophiles beware.",0

It is well-packaged, Targus have a section on their website that let you check if the tips will work for your equipment, and the supplied tips included ones that were correct for ours. The cords and connectors leave little doubt how to get the thing working. Except, it took me a minute to be sure there was an Empower connector (for some airplanes), but once I hunted I found it under the cigarette lighter connector. It all comes with a carrying bag.Two oddities. One is that the power supply unit has a very bright blue light shining when it is working. I don't mind this. The other is that, after unhooking the tip from my equipment, the power supply shuts off and I can't work out how to turn it back on again. It does come on if I unplug it from the wall and then replug it. Still, right now that aspect feels more like a bug than a feature, and cost this unit a star",0
3850,"HDTV Review - Sony KDL-32S2400. Overall I am very satisfied with this HDTV set.  I am very pleased with it's ability to receive over-air HDTV broadcasts.  Every local station is strong with only an old-fashioned set-top rabbit ears (with UHF loop) that I have set on the floor behind a chair near the set.  I think the sound is a little flat, and I don't like the glare off the screen and the gloss black band across the lower part of the set.  However, brightness is very good and dimensional depth of the picture is outstanding.  Some shows, like the PBS HD broadcasts have a 3-D look to them.  This is the main reason I bought Sony.  Another surprise was how good DVD movies looked in widescreen format.  The progressive scan feature of the DVD player produces an image that is excellent on this screen.  If I could ask Sony for one thing it would be to provide some way to adjust the set controls for Normal, Zoom, Wide, and Wide Zoom.  Films shown in widescreen format over regular cable (I have DISH) cannot normally be adjusted larger without cropping more of the image than I would like.  This might be a problem with most sets, but Sony could provide some tweaking here",0

3857,"Power UPS! Everything you need to know. First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin",0
3858,"Impressive. When I saw this component stereo system in a ""Good Guys"" store I was immediately impressed with the overall look of the thing. As I started toying with the floor model, I realized how versatile it was, and decided that it was something I wanted to own. Sadly, the floor model was the only unit left in the store, and there wouldn't be anymore coming since ""Good Guys"" was going out of business. That was not acceptable to me. So, I went elsewhere to find the same system.When I found the item on-line, for a much better price, I was sold.Getting it only took a few days, and it was delivered right to my place of work, for my convienence.What impressed me the most about the unit was the sheer depth of sound it produced. When playing a movie with grand scenes and lots of special effects, the little system did not disappoint in giving a theatrical experience in sound.Other features were also pretty cool to me, such as the LCD light. While it gave off a nice blue glow, it could be dimmed, which was a nice touch.All in all, with all the features this device has, I am certain I will have many years of enjoyment. It is a great system for the right price and truly impressive",0

3867,"Hear The Difference. I've read some different opinions of these 'phones and people have said they don't fit your head (this is ridiculous since they're adjustable) or that they are very easy to break, which in my experience it has been the exact opposite. I've caught the cord on things numerous times, had somebody knock them off of my desk, somebody even sat on them and they still remain the same as when I first purchased them. No scratches, cracks, disconnections or breaks of any kind. I would actually inform people that these are quite sturdy and durable instead of making it seem as though they will snap with the first wrong move.The sound quality is just amazing for the price and as others have noted, they're much better all-around headphones than the Sony brand in the same price range. I tested both for long periods of time and gave them each a fair amount of burn-in. In the end the Sennheisers are a much bigger bang for your buck. As for them sounding like tin cans or even more laughable: sounding better when they're cupped by your hands, those statements are just entirely false as another reviewer has already pointed out. The sound becomes much worse when this is done because it takes away from the sonic accuracy and spatial experience. Maybe the reviewer who said this needs some new equipment or a better understanding of the way these headphones are supposed to work. When you buy open headphones (which, by the way, reproduce better sound than a closed pair) you should know what you're getting and the fact that people will be able to hear what you're listening to if they're close enough. The quality is much better, that's the difference and it's the reason they are made this way. If you're looking for privacy, grab the Sony V6.All in all these are well worth the price tag and will definitely bring a smile to your face if they're your first, second, or even third dip into audiophile territory. However, you must keep moving up the line if your expectations become too high. Headphones in this range can only do so much and these most certainly get the job done for the tag attached to them. Be sure to give them a fair chance and a lot of burn-in before you judge them",0
3868,"JetAudio products are great. The A2 not only plays mp3's but also ogg, wav, wma and frac formats (way to go), but I belieave they can do a lot better. I mean if they wanted they could crush Ipod if only they get out all the potential of their products (like more functions) and make an effort to go multi OS compatible at software level. Also they should do something about their poor manuals and support page. I admit it's easy to follow in practice but it would be nice to have all the in and outs of the A2 on the website (to avoid killing trees). Maybe a forum?I bought the A2 cause it was recommended by RedHat as being a great multi-format media player and at this JetAudio delivers, as well as having a friendly Graphical User Interface. I did have some problems with recording from the TV (picture freeze) but still can't say if this was a TV problem or an A2 problem and I haven't had time to play more with it.So my summary on the Cowon A2 is:Do I recommend it? Yes.Can JetAudio do better? Absolutely.Oh, BTW. Thumbs up on the communication compatibility with their other players",0
3869,Overall good product. This product is a good choice for a reasonable price. My cons for this product are: Its as wide as a dvd player.  I have seen other products out there that are smaller if you are looking for a compact design. The other issue I encountered is every great while a song will skip.  This could be due to the fact that there are five wireless networks in range. I have not spent too much time investigating this issue b/c its not that big of a deal.

This card consistently receives a good signal and operates at 108mbps very far away from the gateway.The only reason I am giving this wireless card four stars is because many Windows XP users have had trouble with it,0
3879,"Nap feature and extendable snooze make this a winner. One thing I don't like about this clock radio is that it doesn't have a backup battery.  Currently I usually do not need to rely on the radio waking me up in the morning, but when I do I make sure my Palm PDA is beside the bed to wake me if there was a power outage.I tried the weather channels once, and it didn't pick up very well.  I have an older Sony clock radio (that loses time) that I can use for weather that picks up weather just fine.What makes this a winner for me is the extendable snooze and nap timers.  Now if I want to take a nap I don't have to mess with setting one of the alarms.  I just push one button several times and it's all set.  I would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone.I use the extendable snooze occasionally, but I don't know if there is a point at which it no longer works -- some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze -- this makes it unusable for me because I don't trust myself knowing that when I am half asleep!Sound quality is great, I like how you can set the track of the CD and how loud it should be.  All in all a pretty good clock radio, but if you rely on it and don't have a backup, the lack of battery backup is a serious problem",0

3882,"Excellent kit, but not for everyone. Normally, I would never have bought this.  However, I recently moved things around in my office and noticed that the AirPort Express input on my receiver was getting some interference in the right speaker (other inputs were not, however).  I had been using a $5 Radio Shack 1/8""-to-dual RCA plugs cable.Rather than debug the interference, I decided to buy an optical cable.  It's convenient that Apple makes this kit--no stress over whether I had bought the right cable.I'm using the optical cable to connect the AirPort Express to the receiver; the interference is gone--mission accomplished.  The power extension cable is useful not only for the AirPort Express but also for the power bricks Apple ships with the iBook and PowerBooks--which is how I intend to use it (keeping it in my laptop bag so I have less cable churn when I travel).I agree the kit is expensive, but it's also convenient.  For those with the money, the kit is perfect... and the white cables match the AirPort (whereas black Radio Shack cables do not)",0

Great for running or other exercise - just clip it to your pants or shorts.  Nano fits perfectly in the clear case. Protects screen and remainder of surface (but not wheel) while adding very little bulk.   Only problem was that the plug for my Shure E3c earphones was too thick to push all the way through the narrow bottom slot.  Careful filing on the case widened the slot around the earphone jack another 1/8 inch and all works fine now.   The manufacturer should widen the slot to at least accomodate earphone plugs that are no thicker than the Nano.   Otherwise, 5 Stars.",0
3885,"Does What it Should. I own this case and have been very satisfied with it. it DOES have a belt loop, which is a piece of fabric about 1 inch wide that spans vertically from the top to bottom of the back side of the case. i keep my iPod in it (3rd generation, 10gb) with plenty of room to spare. there is a zippered pocket on the other side for earphones or memory cards.  zipper is high quality, and the zipper handle is made out of rubber. the mesh part of it stretches to hold your mp3 player.  note: the color is less copper looking than in the picture. it is more of a champange color. and if you want a mini disc player case, look at the case logic mini disc player case",0

I do a lot of traveling for business and need to fit my personal laptop into the same bag as my business laptop. It is a little big for my 14.1-inch machine, but that was expected. You can't beat the price around ten dollars.There seems to be some controversy around the metal logo on the bag. I was able to pry off the outer logo easily but the metal clasp on the inside of the bag is a little tricky to get at. I actually had to cut a small hole in the inner liner (not the neoprene) with scissors to get it out, after this I just sealed the cut with white glue to keep it from fraying- still not a big deal.

3888,"The Most Advanced PC programmable Remote for the $$$. I have an elaborate Home Theater setup with high end & pro audio equip. Plasma HDTV, Digital Cable Box, DVD, MP3 Player, CD Changer, DVD Recorder,VHS Recorder & Media Center PC + The Bedroom TV, Music & DVD setups. I ended up w/ 12 remotes & was going crazy fumbling for the right one.(12 is the max for this model) ... Anyway, I shopped around & found this to be the best bang for the Buck. Software & USB cable made programming Devices very easy. An activity button allows you to add commands to perform a 1 touch function (quite nice) ex. Watch DVD. My monitor, Amps, DVD player, all turn on to the correct inputs, effects & defaults to the DVD remote controller for DVD & amps volume controls.  Pretty much all of the original remote's unique buttons & controls forward over. You can also hold the original to this gadget & add buttons, via command learning for those unfound controls that the software may have missed, very important to me. You can change text display tags for devices & activities simply. You can add default inputs & auto play functionality or remove it. The unit's  backlight allows full darkness visuals for night time use. The software found all my devices, by model # entry, no prob.(some of my stuff is very new & some is a few years old. Overall programming worked well) The time consuming part, was to get the activities to all default properly, based on your wiring setup(pretty common). Requires you to play around for a while before your content. Higher $$$ remotes are pretty much, the same to get right. Overall, nice to have a ""one for all"" finally. Unit quality is nice,buttons are labelled & spaced decently. The screen is nicely readable,as well as, the buttons. The Buttons are hard buttons, meaning they have a click feel, nice when in the dark. light is in the center ( thumb action ) easy to remember. As with any elaborate device, be prepared to spend some setup time. No highend gadgets are for the lack of patience type. Read (your PC screen) & understand as you go, like any PC application & It will eventually make sense. Higher models will allow more devices to be added & a couple features of ease. Use your needs as a guideline, they all are of the same basic design quality.  Good Unit, Great Price, Sleek feel & good time consumption activity for the detailed enthusiast. You'll be thrilled when your done & it works ! You need to know the wiring setup & be educated on your components. More of an older Teen to Adult level of knowledge required. The PC USB made sense & no user manual reading was required. . Younger may get lost, programming this. After all your efforts are done, a young child or guest should be able to use it simply.If you have a need for something like this than Get one !!! & have it's power all in one hand !!! I give it (*****) 5 Stars for what it's  worth!!!",0

I was a little skeptical about purchasing a big ticket item like a 46"" LCD online however all my fears were relieved after delivery and the HUGE price savings were realized! I saved nearly $800 by purchasing my Samsung TV on Amazon.com. That price savings included shipping as well. Not only did I save lots of money, but they also delivered it and took it out of its box in my livingroom. I didn't have to borrow a truck or try and cram it in my car. GREAT picture, even though I don't have a 1080p signal to it, just the 720 with limited HD digital cable channels.

3895,"Great little travel speaker system for the iPod!. I bought my iPAL two years ago to take with me when I travel (particularly airplane travel).  I can throw this in my suitcase without it taking up very much room, and then, when I am in a hotel room, I have great sounding audio from my iPod or from my MacBook Pro laptop.  I researched and tested many other portable units to use with the iPod and this one by far had the best sound.  Sure it doesn't fill a concert hall with sound, but it sure sounds better that any of the other portable units I tried.  Even though it isn't stereo it's sound is still crisper and more even.  With most portable stereo units I tried you really couldn't tell you were getting stereo once you got a few feet away from it anyway.  As far as volume, this unit is great for what it is meant for.  If you want a lot of volume you should buy one of the Bose or Logitek systems (both much larger and more expensive).  For both portability and quality of sound this one gets my vote",0

For both DVD playback and presenting slide shows (from pictures in iPhoto) it has produce clear and crisp video.  With both of the TVs I only had the opportunity to use composite video rather than the s-video connector so the results may differ when using that interface.  The only negative for me was the form factor.  While it is of a convenient size for packing with a laptop for travel, the relatively large weight at the and of a short cable made positioning of the adaptor awkward without using additional video cable between the television and the computer",0
3897,Use your imagination and the price can't be beat. This product is a great deal.  The problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination.  Get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires (they fit perfectly). Friends will compliment you on your post-modern taste and sense of design as well!

3902,"Good corded headset. I have a couple of these, one I bought about two years ago, the other last month.What can I say? It works for me. It is comfortable, it stays in my ear, I can hear my callers, and they can hear me. Sony made one design change: the first one has an L-shaped plug because it was only intended to work with cell or wireless phones. The newer one has a straight plug and comes with an adapter/extension cable for use on a PC. Since I only use them with phones, I'd have preferred that they stayed with the original plug.If you need a corded headset (either because your phone does not support Bluetooth or you're waiting for them to make Bluetooth headsets that look a little less dorky), this is a good choice",0
3903,"Well worth the money. One thing you will read in reviews when people first use the IM716 headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running.  Had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are NOT reccomended to use while running, bycycling or driving a car.I use them for long airplane flights, long walks between classes and relaxing at home, and these headphones are fantastic.  Once you get it situated in your ear correctly, it takes a few tries to figure it out, you won't want to take them off.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible; this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format.  If all of your music is encoded in .mp3 at 128kbs you arn't doing yourself justice.  I have some songs in apple losses and some in ACC 192kbs (w/ vbr) and I am very happy with the sound quality.The clip, located about 6-8 inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla, Bass and High Definition.  The Bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly (for those who complain that the earphones aren't loud enough) and the High Definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat.Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them.  They are worth MUCH more than the 67.00 I paid for them",0
3904,"Works Perfectly. I bought 3 sets of these for my entertainment center.  They work flawlessly.  I laugh at people who purchase Monster Cables.  These work just as good, and if you think you can tell a ""difference"" with Monster Cables, I challenge you to a double-blind test.  You won't be able to tell any difference.  My only complaint is that these cables are very thick, and hard to manuever in small quarters (i.e., through holes in the back of your entertainment center stand).  If you are on a budget, these are the way to go",0

I bought fine grade sandpaper (small grit) and gently worked their signatures off, which only took a few hours, and then after a few more hours of sanding with increasingly finer grades of sandpaper and ultra-fine steel wool and then buffing with cheesecloth for smoothing it all out, it looks almost like normal! Now I have the ""bomb"" looking iPod. I put one U2 song on it just for Karma, but I never listen to it. Get this now, and the sandpaper is available at Hardware stores (get the small grit kind)",0

3913,"Highly Versatile. I got an Olympus 700-series camera 3 years ago and this camera uses AA cells instead of a battery pack.  It also drinks batteries like water if you use the flash.  It also needs 1.5v batteries - Nimh or NiCd's just don't work.So when Ray-o-vac released the ""Renewal"" rechargeable alkaline battery, i was ecstatic.  I got the batteries and got the charger.  The ability to recharge these special batteries is what make it a 3-in-1 charger.The charger is very smart; when a battery is charged it shuts off.  I have read that this extends the life of most types of cells.  I can also tell if a cell needs to be ""topped off"" by placing it in the charger - it will shut off right away if the cell is o.k.The capacity is 1-4xD, or 1-4xC, or 1-8xAA, or 1-8xAAA cells. The ability to charge just one cell is an improvement over my GE stereo charger.  I wish that Ray-o-vac made a charger that was 2x as large.  When I get in the mood to charge I want parallelism, baby.The contacts are good and the unit is reliable; it does what the marketing says it does, so I'm a happy customer.NOTE: renewal rehargeable alkaline batteries are getting hard to find, but I believe there are now other makers of rechargeable alkaline batteries.  Also, the renewal batteries only last about 20 charges, i've taken to writing the date on the batteries when i use them for the first time, and I try to keep them together in sets.  Tonight I am looking to buy some generic batteries of this type, and I believe they will charge properly in my charger",0

3916,"Very Impressed Overall. Things that I like:(1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.(2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.(3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.(4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.(5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.(6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.(7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being ""out of range.""(8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort.What I don't like:(1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far.(2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width.Five Stars",0

I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one.

I bought an HDTV in December and have been getting by pretty well with my RCA antenna which was 30 bucks, but I'm now adding Dish Network HD and decided to get another antenna so I could watch HDTV while I'm recording HDTV thus requiring 2 sources.  This antenna blows my other one away.  My TV has a bar indicator (sorta like a cell phone) and I typically got half the possible bars, but with this antenna, all my bars are maxed out when pointing it towards those towers.  Even the towers in the opposite direction are giving me half the bars now.  I no longer have to fiddle with or adjust the antenna to tweak reception, it's just all channels all the time.  I highly recommend this one, be sure to turn on the amplifier!  The only complaint would be how it looks but free HDTV has a small price to pay there",0

I had this FM direct adapter along with a Arkon SR88s 15"" Flexible Gooseneck Steel Mounting Pedestal installed in my car at the local Best Buy.To give you an idea how well this FM direct adapter works for me I can tell you there are no empty radio channels here where I live. There is some sort of station signal or noise coming through on all of the channels that the Myfi is able to transmit on. With this adapter the sound is coming in nice and clear. It overrides the noise and injects the XM signal right into the antennae jack of the car radio giving a very clean XM signal. It's working great for me.Best Buy did not have the goosneck adapter so I bought one online and had them install the goosneck, the fm direct adapter, antennae and they hot wired it all. There are no wires visible anywhere and the gooseneck positions the radio right where I want it. The Myfi is set up to automatically shut on or off with the car ignition.

The bass very deep and powerfull, tighter and more detailed than the CX300, but not that ""make you wanna' smack your momma"" kind of bass found in the super.fi5EB's. The midrange is somewhat distant, but can be boosted with ipod presets. The highs are very apparent and not as overpowerd by bass as the Super.fi5EB's nor as tinny as the CX300's.

I hesitated before buying because many reviewers complained about too-heavy bass, or bass distorting male voices. It sounds alright to me. If you do find the bass too strong plugging the bass reflex hole on the back reduces bass noticeably.- The display has just the right brightness on the lower setting. Viewing angles are excellent.- Auxiliary input is good to have in case I need it one day.- Dual alarms useful for couples or if you need waking from your afternoon nap.- Charcoal colour has a nice sober and quality look. I find the more popular platinum model looks cheap and plastic-y.- Rarely used buttons are hidden under a flap.- No battery required for battery backup, but see major flaw below...Downsides:- In case of power failure an internal battery keeps the time and your settings, BUT THE ALARM WILL NOT SOUND. Can you say ""missed flight""? NOT GOOD.- High price.- The snooze button should be larger and placed closer to the front.- Large size.This is definitely a 5-star product, but the battery backup flaw forces me to give only four",0
3935,worth trying. despite misgivings concerning several reviews on the hk cd changer i bought it in an attempt to gain better remote compatability with my other hk equipment.  hk has the rare feature that allows you to hardwire daisy chain the remote control function of your hk equipment to each other.  the changer sounds great... much better than the sony changer it replaced.  i have it connected both digitally and analog.  the analog has more depth while the digital is more crisp.  no mechanism issues.  it does make a lot of mechanical noise and the microchips seem busy doing something.  but if you wait everything seems to work smoothly.  wife likes the way it looks so much so i went ahead a got the matching dvd player.  my system works as easily as theatre in a box but with the sound quality of component,0

3937,"Surprised what a difference this makes.  Much more pleasant working on laptop. I bought this laptop stand when I found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so I could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them.  So now I have the center of the screens at the same height, side-by-side.  It is really nice to have twice the screen real-estate.I figured that mostly I would put background stuff on the laptop screen (like email) and use my big hi-resolution screen for what I was activly working on.  But, now that the laptop screen is up at eye level, I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor!  It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it, even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised.",0

The ear-clips are firm enough to hold your ear but not so tight that they pinch or become uncomfortable; the in-line volume control is one of those features I feel every set of headphones should have.  The sound is clear and should be loud enough to satisfy all but the most demanding (or deaf) of listeners.  The headphone cord is quite long, perhaps a bit too long, but given that one can bind it into a more reasonable length with a twist-tie I don't think of that as much of an issue.

I have a bluetooth mouse, and my battery cords that I bring along and it doesn't add bulk at all.  It fits my 17"" Dell Inspiron laptop perfectly with even a tiny space left.  This is a good product if you travel a lot with your laptop and you want it safe.  But if your looking for a case that is lightweight, then don't look at this one.

The earphones are great too and have only just broken.Cons:  the provided plastic cover is held onto the armband with press studs.  This fits poorly and falls off if you try to use it with the armband.   Solution- buy the optional $10 silicone case and it stays on fine with the added benefit of allowing you to slide an extra battery doen the side of the case ready.  This works well if you use rechargable batteries.I'm thinking of buying another model in case this onme ever breaks, but after hundreds and hundreds of hours witout problem there seems to be no need.",0
3955,"Cute little radio. My wife and I like to listen to AM talk radio and some FM as well, in the evenings. We are spending a lot of time at her dad's house doing some renovations on weekends. I got frustrated with the hassle of unplugging the hard to reach charger on the bedside radio and sometimes forgetting to bring the radio so I started shopping for a radio I could keep in the backpack. I wanted AM/FM and an alarm and a good brand. I like to buy things from people that have been making things for a long time, they tend to get more things right. I did not spend a lot of time on research and somehow I settled on the Grundig G1000A, I think it was the familiarity with the brand name, the shortwave capabilities and availability at a local Radio Shack store that made the decision for me. I really like the little thing. I am a long time licensed Amateur Radio Op and Electrical Engineer and I found nothing to make me unhappy with the radio. Scanning a shortwave band with the manual tuning knob is actually faster/easier/better than with the pushbutton scan feature on my Radio Shack DX 395 bedside radio. Sensitivity on the shortwave bands is just a tad less than the DX 395. The audio is pretty good through the tiny speaker, and really good with the included ear buds. The radio came with batteries, I thought that was a nice touch. Battery life is quite good. The leatherette case is a very nice touch, I can put the radio in it, put the whole thing in the box and put it all in the backpack and not worry about throwing the backpack around. The little radio is a good looking thing and that is something I appreciate. The Black on Silver motif is easy on the eye. Some of the lettering on the front panel is on the top of some plastic and it appears to ""float"" and produces a ""3D"" effect that is just nice. I can not express how I feel about stuff from Japan with black lettering on black plastic!! How stupid can a designer be?? This little radio gets an ""A"" for design all the way around, the tuning knob being on the opposite side of the volume knob makes the unit very easy to tune and adjust the volume and you can operate the band switch with your thumb at the same time. The frequency tends to drift a little bit, all analog tune radios have that problem, this is not severe at all, mine always drifts downward on the AM band so I tune a little above the frequency and can listen for hours without having to worry about it. You have to get the idea that you fine tune the radio with your ear, not by looking at the frequency display, small changes in freq. can be tuned with no change in the display since the display is really an add on.I give this radio a ""5"" not on any technical matter but on the design and the fun factor. I have some fun with it listening to Shortwave and it works perfectly for the main reasons I bought it. Kudos to Grundig",0
3956,"great deal. these headphones are (in my experience) probably the best buy if you want good quality and will only settle for new. they are great for loud or soft sounds, excellent quality no matter what is necessary.i think the only downside is that they lack any sort of foldability, which doesn't detract from the fact that they are a wonderful purchase and will keep you happy whether you only play games or listen to any music (great lows and highs)",0

I like the ability to adjust the position of the subtitles.  I watch movies a lot with them on and it's just nice to have some more freedom with that.Overall, this DVD player isn't the absolute ""Best"" DVD player out there, but if you're looking for a high quality player for a low budget price, this is definitely the perfect item.",0

3960,"A must have for using multiple sources, not worth it for HD alone. Don't buy the Sling HD connect cable - more accurately referred to as a component video adapter - if you're eager to get your Slingbox Pro broadcasting HD quality, since it won't do that.  Instead, buy it if you want to connect multiple sources to your Slingbox, since the 4-way IR blaster that's included means you can actually take advantage of the full input capability of the Pro.  I take a star off on both how this has been mismarketed and how it should have been included with the Pro, but it's a must have if you're going to truly take advantage of the Pro's capabilities.The Slingbox is a really neat toy, but they've done a semi-unethical job positioning the Pro and this adapter as HD ""compatible"" in an attempt to catch on to the HD upgrade wave.  Some of it isn't their fault, as bandwidth is a huge issue.  Think of it this way: compressed high definition video in 1080i runs somewhere in the 8-10 GB/hour range, with  uncompressed video directly from over-the-air stations running quite a bit higher.  Even the fastest current cable modems - let alone DSL - would have problems keeping up with that, and with uploading generally limited to 1/10th that speed to prevent you from running a file server, it's a moot issue, which is why the Slingbox limits remote uploads to 320x240.  And while you can get closer to the required speed on a LAN and the Pro transmits 640x480 video over it, it'd probably take $600 more of hardware for the Slingbox to process a 1080i stream - and while Slingbox is neat, it's certainly not $1000 neat.So the Slingbox downrezzes any HD signal you send into it.  Whether or not connecting a HD component to this adapter results in improved output depends a whole lot on how well your DVR or TV already downrezzes to 480i, which also makes sense: an expensive piece of hardware like that generally has better electronics to do so.  Generally, the best reason to buy this for the HD input capability alone is if you have an oddball HD source, like my DVHS VCR which doesn't display menus in certain resolutions.  Otherwise, it's a crapshoot as to whether or not you'll get improved video even within your LAN.  (Outside of it you probably won't notice the difference much either way.)  And by the way, even though the port looks like it accepts an HDMI input, the adapter only accepts component video inputs - although at least it includes a set of component video cables so you can pass through the signal if you need to without spending any more than you already have.The reason you buy this, though, is that the Pro is very good at streaming 4 separate devices - but while you can connect 3 devices without this item, you can only control 2 with the IR blaster that comes with the Pro.  I spent a while trying to figure out a workaround for this, looking into such things as 3/32"" Y cable splitters connecting to 1/8"" plugs and looking into finding another brand of IR blasters since Sling won't sell you a second one.  Then I hit my head against the wall once I realized this includes a 4-prong IR blaster.  Basically, buy this cable set if you plan on taking full advantage of the Pro's capabilities to remotely control more than 2 devices - or get a headache.No real excuse for Sling Media not to include this with the Pro and not to explain it to the consumer properly, but such is life",0

3982,"IPod to Go!. I originally bought the CDA-9856 and exchanged it for this CDA-9857 model. Why? I have a 30 Gig IPod and it's difficult to dial through all of my 100's of albums/artists/playlists, let alone songs, with the slow rotary dial while I'm driving. The 9857's ""Percentage Search"" skip ahead feature makes selecting/playing music from the IPod a real pleasure. The 9856 doesn't have this feature. Also when searching albums, the 9857 displays 3 albums at a time, whereas the 9856 only displays 1. Both head units, however, only display 13 characters of the album/song title. This makes it very difficult to select the correct album if you have several with the same name for the first 13 characters, or perhaps multiple discs of the same album, but easier with the 9857 because it shows 3 albums at once. The 9857 is also a digital display, rather than analog as with the 9856, and the digital interface really speeds up the menu item selection and seems to make the IPod interface more ""stable"" (I had a problem with the MIX feature alternately refusing to turn on and then randomly turning on by itself with the 9856). Is it worth the extra $100? Well, I plan on keeping this car and this head unit for 5-8 years, so the ease of use that the 9857 offers makes listening to my IPod a pleasure that I'll enjoy for years to come, and to me that's worth the extra money. This is a darn good unit.",0
3983,"It really works! 100% clear digital signals! You will LOVE IT!. I do live somewhat close to L.A Calif but I did not expect to get the signal and quality i'd get from buying this. I gave up on TV all together because I refuse to paid $60+ a month for satellite or Cable. Sure satellite is cheaper but then you need a phone line. $20 more a month right there. I use cell phones so no use for a phone line in house. I will first off say that DO NOT BUY if you dont have a Digital TV. These are satellite DIGITAL signals you are picking up, not regular analog channels. But if you do, you will think you have a satellite dish sitting outside your house. I get all 2-13 channels in pure 100% digital quality and i'd say 20+ other channels in 100% digital from history, cartoons, cooking, movie. Now I pay NOTHING per month. I had mine on top of the TV but figured it would work even better on my covered patio.. I was right. Just a stronger signal. If you have a place outside, get the outdoor version.

3985,"Excellent Bluetooth Receiver!. While certainly not a cheap unit, this device is worth every cent. It basically has all the high-end features you expect in a Premier deck, but it also has Bluetooth! So I won't bother talking much about the awesome sound quality, great color LCD that is very easy to read in ANY lighting condition, or the many extra audio features. :)Since Bluetooth is of course the feature that sold me on the unit, let's talk more about that. (If you want more info on non-Bluetooth stuff, check out the P7800MP).I have it paired with my Sprint PPC-6700 PDA phone (latest firmware), and it works great. First thing to note that is your BT phone may not support all the features available. For example, the signal meter, battery level, and phone book transfer don't seem to be supported with my model. Also keep in mind that the manual does indicate that almost all of the ""extra"" Bluetooth features may or may not work on your particular phone. This is typically the result of your phone not supporting all the bluetooth ""protocols"" it uses.The PDA paired up just fine, and once ""registered,"" the P9800BT will remember your phone. It also has an ""Auto Connect"" feature, that when enabled, will always look for your phone and happily connect to it when it's in range (typically within about 10-20ft).So here is what happens when you get a call:1. The phone rings through your stereo (you can pick a few built-in ringers) and the music is muted for you.2. Caller ID is displayed on the bright/clear LCD (phone number only - unless you programmed or transferred a phone book)3. You press the handy ""Multi-Function"" button to answer your call (there is an ""auto-answer"" feature available) and you are Live with your caller.4. When the call is over, you may hang up yourself, or wait for the caller to hang-up.5. Then the music starts playing where it left off.My friends still can't get over how cool that is. :) But what if you want to make a phone call? You've got a few more options!1. Dial the number on the remote.2. Use the built-in phonebook (if you transferred or created one yourself) to pick the number to dial.3. Use call history to dial a previous number4. Or the way I prefer - use voice recognition! I simply press the Telephone button and then hold down the ""Band"" button. Then using the voice recognition already programmed in my PPC-6700, say the caller's name, and it dials for you.So if you've used a hands-free ear-piece with your BT phone, it's rather similar.This unit is installed in a 2000 Z71 Tahoe with exhaust and big all-terrain tires. So this isn't exactly a ""quiet"" environment. Which is why I've been very pleased with the call quality. No static, no echo, and both myself and caller can hear each other just fine. If there is an echo, it is because I have the volume turned WAY up (and only the caller hears the echo.) The mic is mounted on the sun visor, but can be mounted anywhere that works in your vehicle (dash, steering column, etc).And to wrap things up, here are a few pro's/con's regarding the unit as a whole.Pros:- Has all the awesome features of a loaded pioneer head-unit (WAY too many to list here, check out the online manual)- Excellent sound quality with any source (Thanks to 24-bit D/A converter and DSP w/ 16-band EQ)- Mini-Jack (1/8"") stereo connection on back of receiver (in addition to the typical pioneer proprietary connection for auxiliary sources).- Impressive color LCD that can be easily read at night or in direct sun-light- Bluetooth works surprisingly well... and reliable!- Auto connection feature for Bluetooth phones- Included mic works great- Rather cheap considering all the features you get (about $400 at time of review).Cons:- Won't work with a typical GM/Pioneer wiring harness (must be hard wired)- Doesn't work with some of the ""minor"" extra Bluetooth features on my phone (probably my phones fault there).- The new ""Multi-Function"" button takes some getting used to.- There have been a few rare instances where BT wouldn't automatically pair up with my PDA. Could be the PDA and/or receiver though.- People will think you are crazy talking to yourself while driving.Overall, *most* of the initial setup is straight forward - just keep the manual handy for the BT stuff. :) I've tried many other ""portable"" hands-free units; none worked nearly as well as this one. So if you've got BT and want hands-free, I highly recommend this unit!",0
3986,"First impressions. I have only had this for 4 weeks, so I have not tried out all of the possible combinations, but so far it meets all of my expectations and it lives up to the other reviews that I read on it before purchasing.  This is my first true A/V receiver; I had an older Onkyo Amplifier that provided good service over 15 years.  I also upgraded my speakers from 2 positions to 5 with front L/R, rear L/R and a center speaker.  I had Fluance SV-10's with the Onkyo and added an AV-SC and two AV-BP2 speakers.  The room is small enough that I do not need a subwoofer.  The VSX-1016 can be configured to route the low frequencies to the two main speakers and you can choose to bi-amp those speakers if you do not want to use the 2nd Zone feature.  The sound is phenomenal.  I have not made the jump to a large flat screen yet, so I cannot evaluate the HDMI connections yet or any of the HD performance.  CD and DVD performance is very good.  After I have used it more, I will submit an update.  Based on the performance for value I would recommend this to others",0
3987,"Excellent Laser Pointer. This laser pointer is a high quality, sturdy laser pointer. It is very bright and you can even see the green path of the laser going through the air at night. I had absolutely no problems with either the seller or the laser pointer. Thanks",0
3988,"I love this player!. For those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.One of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.I record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iRiver.For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly.I've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products.The single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!The negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.Also, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8"" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it's starting to wear out.  But it's still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.I have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.I'm quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future",0
3989,"Just what it says. This is a great card adapter. The user who thought it would convert an xD card to a Compact Flash was misinformed and their rating should be held against this product.

(Did it by myself.)I used to play CDs using Pioneer CD changer. Now I can use my iPod also in the car.This is a good value product. Driving the car is like being on a concert.It is easy for every day use. You can connect the iPod when you get in the car and disconnect it when you leave the car at parking lot and take the iPod with you. It takes seconds.Buy and enjoy the music on your iPod. It is much better than transferring the music from the iPod by other iPod radio transmitters,0

3995,"A Great Way to Expand Range. This equiptment does require a solid speaker/amp set up.  This will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry.  Not a complaint at all though.The range on this thing is very good, also allows you to EQ recordings you make to CD, Tape or MP3 if desired.  Made the music sound much bigger and sharper.  Especially feeling my CD's were flat in sonic output.  If not desired, the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touch.Mine was built a year or so ago, sat around in it's box and yes, got ""sticky"" before it was sold.  I quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out.  Not a problem since.Smooth operation that doesn't impart a ""click"" onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live.  Plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell.  Quite pleased, gonna buy another",0

3998,Good for the price. These are just fine for what your going to pay for them. To get it a much better speaker your going to have to open up your wallet and pay a whole lot more.

4007,"Perfect mouse for traveling - 2 thumbs up!. This mouse has made traveling with my laptop so much easier. Even though I tend to be an avid user of the track-pad on my PowerBook it can become very tedious and making room for a large mouse has made packing tricky. Since purchasing this mouse I've had no problems and have increase my productivity while on the road. It has also made it easier for those non track-pad users to jump on to my computer without a problem.Although it took a few uses to adapt to the smaller size, I wouldn't trade it for any other mouse. The cord can adjust to any length and has never tangled. The software included to customize the mouse buttons, speed, etc. is easy to use and has allowed me to adapt the mouse to my specific style.Definitely a must have mouse",0

4014,"Good player, but has it's bugs. The I bought the MZ-RH910 one year ago and so far it has been the most convenient player around. The player itself is well designed and the features are very welcomed, specially the line in recording, which makes good quality recordings. The problem is in the PC-Player interface. SonicStage sucks to be honest. The program crashes often during transfer and the transfer speed with conversion is slow (which could be the program, the player write speed or both). Also the player strangely does not recharge while connected, you have to press and hold the stop key so it'll go into recharge mode, so you can't listen to it while it is recharging. The battery life isn't great either, at most 4-6hrs, My old mini disc runs on regular AAs and it gives me well over 10hrs. Overall not a bad player, specially for recording. I have to admit sound quality even during compression is admirable. But bugs here and there make it cumbersome to use",0

4017,"Excellent Bang for the Buck! - OSX. This scanner worked flawlessly out of the box with my new Intel Powerbook. It took only a couple of minutes to unpack it, take off the tape, unlock the transport lock on the bottom of the unit, polish the glass surface, plug in the USB cable to the computer and attach the power outlet.Installing the software was a simple insert the CD and respond to the screen prompts.Hint: After the software is installed and you run it the first time you will be asked at the bottom of the scan screen to identify (link) it with an ""external program"" - I would advice skipping the PhotoArc software installed by the CD and ""link it"" to your iPhoto application. Now when you make a scan it will be instantly installed in your iPhoto library. You can easily use the iPhoto tools to crop, clean, and organizae your photos.I have been using this with an OSX genealogy program (Reunion 9.03 and highly recommended).One limitation is that the negatives are for 35 mm only. If you have a lot of large negatives you will have to look at other options. However, the 35 mm negatives works alright but it is almost faster to scan just the photos.I have owned more expensive scanners but for $90 )including a free Amazon shipping promotion) makes this an excellent purchase.",0

4020,"Exactly what I ordered. Other than the fact that it came with only a USB cable and earphones, it was brand new in the box and was just what I ordered.  It works great.

Missing the bass, I quickly got a polk subwoofer and it was a new world,  ABBA never sounded so good in life!  Then, of course I had to have surround, so these litle fellas were appropriately assigned rear surround duty, at which they soldjerly march on.  Not the best, not the worst, but adequate for a little 12X20 living room when paired with a subwoof, and pair of nice JBL Northridge in front.

4035,"On the Contract. If you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.Some notes on the contract:1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, ""You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You."" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will ""replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY."" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover ""the elements or acts of God"" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase ""at our discretion"" in the contract.Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)",0

4038,"Very good hardware, substandard software. This is a TV card I used to replace my aged Lifeview FlyVideo98FM card, so I could watch/record (Trinidad & Tobago) games from TV during the world cup in June '06.The TV quality is the best I ever seen from a TV card to date. Give that it is an ATI based card, this is really good stuff.Unfortunately, the software package has let me down. The card came Bundled with Cyberlink PowerCinema. In day to day usage of my computer, I like to have the FM Radio function on. With the old card and 3rd party FM Radio software, there was no issues at all... With this new card, I often can't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering - this on a computer with 1GB RAM and 2 hard drives!I definitely blame the software for this. If the sticking becomes too much then the Radio stops altogether. I'm forced to close and re-open Power Cinema to listen to Radio again.TV is at least stable while doing other stuff, but you can't shrink Powercinema down to a 320x240 window. also there is a 2 second lag between TV and computer watching the same TV station. This never occured with the old card. Intervideo's WinDVR used with this card had no such issue.It's a pity I don't have XP Media Center Edition (XP Pro I have) to compare XP's Media Center software with Cyberlink's.. Somehow I think Media Center will perform better. WinDVR works better too, barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card.PowerCinema works, but it's not very intuitive. The software is written for the novice user with NO advanced options at all. When recording, you do not know exactly what quality you're using outside of ""good"", ""better"" or ""best"". You can't even change the default recording folder!I am sure that this occurs with other brands of Theatre 550 Pro cards, not just MSI's version.As a side note, the remote that comes with the card works well.In conclusion, It's a card worth getting if you can deal with PowerCinema's Issues, or find a better program to use with the card.",0

Admittedly I cannot crank it really loud at my desk, but for office use, I can hear it clearly and someone else over the cubicle wall does not hear it at all.It folds up nicely and precisely, compact enough to fit in my lunchbox.Now, the downside is that it doesn't come with an ac adapter, even though it needs one if you don't have a usb port handy. The BIGGEST annoyance though is that even though it says ipod nano, and its the right color, there's no way it was designed for it. In order to plug in your nano it has to sit upside down in a slot 4 times bigger than it needs to be...so in other words, your nano is very loose. For sitting on my work desk, its no biggie, but if you were thinking it was going to look like the cool ad for it, it won't",0

As of Dec 06, I have owned this for about 8 months and I'm impressed with the product and with Buffalo's very strong 24x7 tech support. I did have one unit mysteriously fail after about 3 months, and was able to get a replacement under RMA without too much hassle (had to send in the dead one and wait for a replacement).Two Windows XP-based PCs use the LPV3 to share a Canon ip4200 without any problem whatsoever. However, we tried to connect a new OS X-based MacBook to LPV3 and failed even after calling Buffalo and Apple technical support. The MacBook can indeed see the print server, but I can't find any way to get it to recognize the 4200. I suspect this is a Canon printer driver issue, though, not a problem with Apple or with Buffalo.It looks like some reviewers had success on connecting Macs to the LPV3 when using Gutenprint driver support (a couple of reviewers here mention success with Gutenprint drivers for Epson 2200 and Canon ip4000), but the Gutenprint drivers do not support ip4200 at this point.Given the challenge getting the MacBook connected, I'm keeping my review to 4 stars on an otherwise 5 star product.By the way: thanks to Amazon for allowing users to share valuable source of information about interoperability and suggestions for making products work together.",0

I would suggest this for anybody looking for good, cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire",0

4048,"BELKIN XM Antenna Headphones Helix Pioneer Inno F5X002. I purchased the Samsung Helix XM radio for listening at home and also as a portable.  The antenna built into the radio is very directional and of course had to be carried high on the body for best reception.  The Belkin XM antenna headphones plugs directly into the radios docking connector. This allows the band between the earpieces to become the antenna and increases reception dramatically.  The radio can now be clipped to an inside pocket, belt or just hand carried and still have 5 bar reception.  The sound quality started out very good and became excellent as the speakers broke in.  The inline volume control is also very handy.I highly recommend this product for use with the Samsung Helix or Pioneer Inno radios.",0
4049,"A Great Value. We ordered the system for our granddaughter's ninth birthday.  We could not be more pleased with it.

To say we are pleased with the system is an understatement",0

4052,"Nice camera. I bought this camera to check on my apt while I am working. So far I am quite satisfied with it. Setting up the remote internet access is a bit tricky, but - I guess- it is always like that with these gadgets. I have a ""standard"" wireless network at home (w/ a Gateway 2wire router).To do so, in brief, you have to open a new channel in your network firewall. This includes a port forwarding of the camera to a channel other than 80 (like 1024).I am also using a linksys software (sololink) to track the dynamic IP address of the camera on the web, but you can use other freeware softwares for that, as well.Pan/tilt function is great, color is OK. I'll try w/ an IR soonIn concluson this is a great camera for this price",0
4053,"Works ""out of the box"" on 15.4"" MacBook Pro. Opened it up, put it in the ExpressCard slot, plugged in my external LaCie HD and it started working immediately.

4054,"Pretty solid product. Solid product, just a little disappointed in the latching mechanism for the dvds.  DVD almosts falls out too easily, but then again, other than transporting them, they sit on a shelf and have no worried.  All in all, they were all intact and a good product",0
4055,"High Sony quality...high Sony pricing. Memory Sticks have always been great technology from day one. The Pro models are no exception. They have fast transfer speeds and are very reliable.Of course, that comes at a price. Compared to the other flash memory standards, Memory Sticks are expensive. Even the SanDisk ""generic"" Memory Sticks aren't that much cheaper than the genuine Sonys.The only other (well documented) drawback to the Pro models is the useless (for digicams) MagicGate feature that steals a fair amount of the total capacity of the card and can't be disabled. Sony really should remedy that for digicam users. Don't hold your breath though.4 stars because of the price issue and the MagicGate annoyance",0
4056,"Works as expected. I have a Dell Axim X50v (PDA) which has build-in Bluetooth. I originally was hooking up the GPS-360 to the X50v using the included cable. I was concern that the Bluetooth would not provide a reliable connection. However, the cable connection is cumbersome, so I decided to try Bluetooth. This dock allowed me to connect the GPS-360 to my X50v wirelessly. And the connection is reliable. The X50v needed to be reconfigured to access the GPS-360 via Bluetooth before first use. The reconfiguration process is not easy. I rate it medium difficult for average users. But you only need to configure it once. Once it is configured then connecting it to the GPS-360 is easy. Now I am (mostly) WIRELESS. (PDA still needs wire to keep it charged.",0
4057,"Nice features for the price. I use it to listen to talk radio in the kitchen and it works well for that. It does have trouble picking up some weaker AM stations, but that could be caused by a lot of different factors. I do use it occasionally for music (both FM and CD) and it works fine but the sound quality is not great.  The clock is cool looking but hard to read",0
4058,"This product is fantastic!!!. I bought this product expecting marginal at best GPS functionality on my Axim X51v but was astounded at how well the product worked.

The only thing it can't do is hook up to your computer.  However, it can store 2yrs worth of training.  If you're a techy, then perhaps the 201 or 301 might be for you.

4067,"Work well for their purpose (and their price). These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money.However, if you're willing to spend a little more, the JLab JBuds are the way to go.  I own both the Gumys and the JBuds, and the Gumys are my workout pair, and I use the JBuds for everything else.But if you're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the iPod buds, the Gumys are the way to go",0

4073,"This is my fourth Sony DVD player, and easily the best. The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking.I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality.Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI.One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs.There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players.Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then",0
4074,"Better than my old Belkin model. It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in.

And there are no long, tiring drives to the race track, no hotel and food expenses, no long waits for the other classes to get off the track, and no long drive home with a wrecked car on the trailer behind you. An hour behind the wheel is an hour racing.I have a heart valve problem and there are times I wonder if this is really safe after all",0

Having 4 functions in one unit streamlines my desk and my tasks.  The LCD screen is bright and easy to read. Controls are intuitive.

4082,"A Remarkable Radio!. I purchased a 'Cobalt/Cherry' version of the Model One radio back in 2003 to 'replace' the annoying 'junk' radio that a co-worker had for us to listen to. His radio would not receive our 'favorite' FM station whenever the weather outside was rainy, or when the equipment bay door was closed (we were in a metal building). My 'new' Tivoli radio changed all that. Not only were we able to listen to our favorite station reliably and clearly, but it just sounded SO much better. Everyone was amazed with the quality of the sound, especially from such a 'small' box!Four years later the same Model One sits on a shelf in my present place of employment and still brings me the joy of music from whatever station I want to listen to. It is extremely sensitive (with the 'wire' antenna supplied) and selective (no 'adjacent channel' interference). It is one of the best ""investments"" I've ever made for a consumer electronics product. The build-quality is top-notch and the real cherry wood veneered cabinet is strikingly beautiful with the dark cobalt blue faceplate. Both music and voices are reproduced with the quality of a fine 'hi-fi' setup and sound as natural. It ""plays"" loudly enough for almost anyone's needs without sounding distorted at higher volumes and it shows that the late Henry Kloss was gifted in understanding the overall ""balance"" necessary to make a great product! Someday I plan to purchase a Model Two for a little 'stereo system' (with my portable CD player plugged into the aux. input jacks on the back )for my bedroom.A truly remarkable product (also available in other color and wood options) and most highly recommended!!!!",0

4086,"Lasted Four Years - I weep for Palm. I am filled with feelings of anger and despair as I see the once great Palm Corporation in its death throes.  I bought my first Handspring Visor Deluxe in early 2001 for $250 -- had it stolen 11 months later -- and bought another refurbished one from Handspring in Feb 2002 for just $100.  The device gave me outstanding service until it died just a few days after its 4th (re)birthday.  A refurbished device lasting 4 years!  Since yesterday I have been looking for a replacement, inexpensive PalmOS handheld.  Unfortunatlely, there is only PalmOne (or whatever they are called now) corporation left (having swallowed Handspring) and the PalmOS has been sold to a Japanese company.  The reviews for Palm's current products -- nearly all from longtime loyal Palm-product users -- nearly uniformly slam the products.I am depressed.  I hate the MS PocketPC (or whatever they call the current version) devices -- they are much too complex, they are slow, they are too Windows-like, and they are darned expensive.  In contrast, PalmOS devices were snappy, reliable, simple and easy to use, and relatively inexpensive.  What more could one ask for?There seems to be no reasonable alternative now.  Should I take a risk with the low end Palm Z22 (and have it fail in two months).  Handspring's customer service used to be outstanding.  Palm's current customer service sucks big time.  Even if the company goes out of business in the next six months (it definitely will be gone before December 2006), I don't care, as long as I can get a decent PalmOS device that lasts the next 4 years.Thanks for all the good times, Handspring and Palm! Too bad you faded away and left us to be devoured by Microsoft",0

4090,"A Must  for Disaster Kits, Emergencies or Camping. Living in central California, the most probable emergencies we face in OUR AREA are earthquakes and power outages.  The Eton FR250 should suit our needs best - as long as radio & cell phone towers are still standing! The FR250 has 7 shortwave bands that might provide information from outside our area if local communications are lost. I let the built-in rechargeable battery (a replaceable 3.6 volt portable telephone battery) completely discharge and then cranked the dynamo the recommended 2 turns per second for 2 minutes (with a short break in between). It provided enough power for the radio to play at a moderate volume for 95 minutes - RATHER IMPRESSIVE and the 2 1/2 inch speaker provides very clear and pleasant audio. Another nice feature is the fine tuning knob.With the built-in battery charged or with the 3 AA batteries, the flashlight will light in very dark conditions (tho not brightly), a path approximately 50 feet.This little radio packs plenty of features at a reasonable price.

No shrink/enlarge options. It does have auto-exposure with a manual override if it's needed. Knowing all of this I think it's a steal at the $25 AR I paid. Otherwise you're probably better off with a scanner and printer for most uses",0
4092,"Works great, but one small drawback. The drive works well, and certainly as advertised.  It is readily accessible from the network, appears to be realibale, and is acceptably fast.The issue I found is that, despite there being two USB ports on the back for atttaching expansion drives, the chipset that the devices runs off does not support addressing any drives bigger than 500GB.

4099,"Worth Every Penny. The Speck Nano SkinTight Deluxe w/ Holster is everything you could ask for in a case. Its very sturdy, durable. There are some hitches, though. First, its tough to get your iPod in at first and the screen protector was also confusing put in. None of this came with instructions. Also, the holster has a belt clip that swivels but isn't really functional unless you never need to see your iPod while its on because the belt clip puts it out of your reach. I'm a new iPod user so I frequently handle my iPod so this posed as a problem. This case serves well for both new or veteran users of iPod, though. New users, like I, might carry their iPod in their pocket or somewhere close to their hand and this case gives you enough protection that you won't have to worry about smudging, smashing, banging, or cracking the body or the screen of the iPod while removing or putting it in a jacket pocket. iPod Nano is so small that it gets lost easily in the shuffle of a pocket but the Speck Nano SkintTight Deluxe gives the Nano some extra gerth to hold onto without making it cumbersome. I often had concerns with accidently touching my click wheel and blasting the volume level during playback becuase of the streamlined feel of the Nano but this case gives it some structure (with a raised click wheel opening) that I need. Veterans of the iPod might have many playlists which would make frequent fiddling with the iPod unnecessary and give a great purpose to tuck the Nano away with the holster. Overall, the pluses outweigh the negatives. Its stylish and purposeful. A good buy",0
4100,"Overall good mouse, with some quirks. I have been using this as my primary mouse for about a month, and am generally happy.  I plan to continue using it for a long time.  The mouse is very comfortable to use and the batteries seem to last longer than I expected (still on the original batteries after a month of daily use).I do find a couple of things kind of annoying about this mouse:* The scroll wheel is hard to press down as a middle click.  Because the wheel is not centered in its opening, sometimes I end up pulling the wheel to the left (side scroll) instead of pressing it straight down.* Horizontal wheel scrolling is mostly worthless, and there is no way to remap horizontal scrolling to any other function.* The scroll wheel is very smooth scrolling, it does not have notches like my old Microsoft Optical mouse.  This works fine for scrolling a scrollbar in an application, but is very annoying for scrolling by page in a PDF file, or zooming in Google Maps because moving the scroll wheel a tiny bit can throw you hundreds of pages away, or zoom you out completely.  It would also making any game that uses the scroll wheel (for changing weapons, for instance) very hard to play.* The default setup for the buttons is not what I had expected.  I had to change the function of the buttons using the provided Microsoft software to get middle clicking to work (the default was ""Instant Viewer"") with the scroll wheel.  Back is the default for the large thumb button, and Magnify was the default for the small thumb button.I had to change the way I used a couple applications (like viewing PDFs in ""Single Page Continuous"" instead of ""Single Page"" view), but overall this is an extremely comfortable mouse, and I would recommend it to anyone who won't have major problems with the annoyances listed above",0

I hate to say this now, but the packaging was flimsy and cheap and the headphones looked bulky and awkward.  After the initial review, I took them out of the box and examined the contours of the earcups, and put them on to test for comfort.  The earcups were extremely well ventilated compared to my last headphones, which left my ears hot and irritated, and the cup covers that contacted around my head were extremely soft and cushiony.  The inside of the cup has the speakers positioned at an angle towards your ears, which is a unique design which I have never seen before.  The headband at the top makes these headphones extremely comfortable, even though I have a huge head, though my brother has a bigger head and says it's a little tight, and all that really bothered me was that it pulled a little on my skin.  Not a big deal after wearing it for extended period of time, as I later found.I plugged everything together and took them for a test drive on my ipod video.  Though the sound was reasonably good, I didn't think it was worth my money, but decided to use them despite this disappointment.  One night I left them on accidentally as I went to bed and I found them still on the next morning.  I turned them off so I could recharge my ipod, and plugged them into the computer.  I don't know so much about headphones but the sound quality was WOW.  The tone had rounded out, and the bass gave me shivers and rang in my ears IN A GOOD WAY.  The detail was much improved and, since then, I have written this review.  Great buy, great quality.  Best headphones I've tried thus far",0
4106,I am pleased... I have been looking for a device to expand the capabilities of my XM2GO.  I took the iMX2 with me camping last weekend and it worked great.  Nice little carrying case with pockets for the AC adapter and XM2GO. Sound quality was very good for such a compact unit. I am pleased with the iMX2,0
4107,Perfect for your studio with the HP Photosmart Pro B9180. More a review of the printer than the ink. This ink is the perfect match with HP's Advanced Photo Paper and the HP Photosmart Pro B918,0

4109,"Hits the Spot!. Wireless is the way to go!When I put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place...Singular and clean looking this Sweet little controller is, IMO, another triumph by Logitech!Though a little smaller than the S-type, it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance. I got mine used and, once again, put old batteries in it(takes 2)...even four months later, I am just now getting the low battery light flashing...Still VibratesStill Responds AcuratelyAnd the analog sensitivity is better than the wired.Get it, get it... GET IT!!",0
4110,"Great Product. You can almost completely stop those peeping toms with this filter.  While it is not 100% effective, it does block or blur most of the view from people who are not directly behind you.  You can kind of see the double sided tape squares you place in each corner to keep it affixed to your monitor but it isn't obvious enough to be annoying or distracting.Amazon.com has the lowest price I could find on the web plus free shipping.  I got my in 3 days and am completely satisified with this product.",0
4111,"Wow! Can I give it 7 stars?. I am glad that there are real software programmers out there that truly know what they are doing.  The maps are accurate and the calculations take almost no time at all (3 seconds for a 400 mile trip - well, that is with my HP Pocket PC and 133x SD card).  I have seen and use other GPS-Map programs and this one is the best.  The only one which could be up to the same level is OnCourse5, but again, the maps are made by the same company as iNav.  All the others I've seen have way too many `buts'.  I love especially how you can zoom to 100 feet or zoom out to 10 miles.  The maps are loaded automatically as you pan the screen (giving that you had installed the whole city, or state, or country when you first setup the application in your PDA) and it shows you all the rivers, lakes, mountains, parks, etc.  It really does what it says it can do and in the way it says it can do it!!  I wish that the updates for software and maps could be free.  Oh, by the way, you can use it without a GPS receiver: ALL features are fully functional (except for the one that tells your current position, of course).  NOTE: a lot of time has passed since this review was first posted.  Now, version 3 is on the market.  It is even better, much better",0
4112,"Fantastic Add-On for iPod Mini. I have my iPod hooked up to the stereo on my motorcycle. The iPod stays tucked away in a safe place, and the remote gets strapped to the handlebar. All the needed functions are now at my fingertips. I can lock the iPod control pad, so it doesn't accidentally get bumped.I also use the Griffin FM transmitter. Nice, but not nearly as slick as the remote. I can't use them both at the same time, but I don't need to",0
4113,Do Not Buy This From J&R!. J&R charges $28+ for shipping on this item!  I even called them to have the obvious typo corrected they had a rude attitude with me.  Never will buy from J&R again.As for the adapter - it does the job well. The other reviewer doesn't seem to know how to plug something in,0
4114,Excellent Buy. Not as easy to use as a larger Panasonic I used to own butotherwise fine. Good sound.  Using CD player and radio.Buying via Amazon as usual is super,0
4115,256MB Memory Stick Pro Black Magicgate Compatible. great product at great rate. highly recomended to buy from amazon. no one can beat that. i check the prices every where but ameZon had the best.....,0
4116,"Excellent...a must have for the normal listener!. If you're looking for a 'real Boom-Box',as in those 70's models with the huge bass, pass this up! If you really want a player with true fidelity that will leave your ears intact...this one is for you! It will fill an entire home with sound that's equal to some of the best eq1uipment out there...and can be as soft as a lullaby, depending on the volume.Controls are very easy to reach...and the remote is a bonus that Sony put in as an afterthought, I think. For a price like this, it comes with a great radio, cassette deck, a sleep feature,and others like CD shuffle programs that I've yet to use! For the money, it's just what I wanted! You won't be sorry that you bought this one at all!",0
4117,"Zaurus battery. I think the battery is fine, but the Sharp Zaurus is power hungry. A spare battery may be a necessity if you plan to use your Zaurus all day, every day.",0
4118,Nice. I think these are very nice headphones for the above average listen.  Every serious music fan needs to have a nice set of headphones.  These are great they are not the best but for an unamplified source they do a dang good job.  I have not had problems like some of the other people but these are my first real set of headphones and I have only had them for a couple of days but no complaints yet.,0
4119,"outstanding. This CB radio has an outstanding performance, but beware of the low volume on the internal speaker, just as an advice you should also buy an extension speaker, there are a lot of low priced Midland extensions on amazo",0
4120,"Good stuff. We bought this microphone to facilitate recording meeting minutes.  It works well in a conference room setting w/ say, 10 to 12 people.  We connect it to a Dell laptop's microphone jack.  Using the mid-boost built into the Sony mic helps a lot.  We also use a free version of Audacity software to record the meeting directly to the computer.  Audacity allows you to rip it to .mp3 format directly for long term archiving which is very handy.  It also makes it easy to distribute minutes widely.  The product works well in these conditions and I'd recommend it",0
4121,"Clean, clear, and good price. This is my first foray (actually it was a gift) into Polk Audio merchandise. I am pleased with the crisp, clear, and detailed high frequency sound it emits. It has considerable resolution and articulation that helps deliever lifelike representations of vocals and instruments. There is virtually no distortion, and it sits above my T.V., which sometimes speakers and T.V.s will play interference with each other, but not this monitor. I have it hooked up to my Sony STR-DE697 Receiver, and it has been able with great clarity to handle high volumes. This is a great buy, even if you have a modest receiver",0
4122,"Terk 50' outdoor extension antena (Sirius). I was getting so frustrated losing my signal to my Sirius Sportster until I purchased the Trek 50' extension antena. I moved and mounted the antena to my roof and now it works great.  I now have 7 to 10 bars instead of the 3 I used to have, I strongly recomend this purchase",0
4123,"Nice Leather Carrying Case -- Recommended. It is always chancey to buy something judging by its online pictures, but I made a good choice for me in selecting this case. In fact, I bought two at the same time.The leather, as some others have noted, is not soft, but I did not expect that in an item in this price range. I wanted something that was made of leather, looked somewhere between casual and formal, and that would protect my notebook from scratches, bumps, rain and wind. This bag does all that. It is not at all bulky and that was another feature I was looking for.The model I purchased was for the 15 inch screen computers, so if you have a 17 inch notebook, you would get the larger size; but the construction is similar. I did not want a huge carrying case because I don't carry extra USB or printer cables, or a bunch of DVDs, yet there is ample room for a power supply and the basics.If you want to step up from the canvas type carrying cases, then you should definitely consider this case",0
4124,"Mini Speakers with a boom. I Love these little guys. I have them on my desk to as a desktop sound system only. I don't use them as a main stereo source. I'm in a small office and each work station in the office has a pair of the Duets, and honestly for blasting your Itunes Music the sound is great, if the sound gets a lil tinny (like a tin can) or too bass heavy it's nothing a lil adjustment to the Itunes EQ can't fix. Their small with good sound clarity and pack a heavy bass sound when it counts. They can fill a 750sq ft studio office easily with it's sound. JBL has the best mini speakers out there in my opinion, I also have the JBL On Stage Speakers for iPod, AWESOME as well!!",0
4125,"Great Camera, does everything I expected. A great web camera for the price.  Plug in the ethernet and power cable, and you are nearly ready to go.  Note that you will have to plug in the ethernet cable for initial setup, even if you are planning on using wireless.  You can access the camera directly, it has its own built in webserver.  This allows any program that can use HTTP to work with it.  Very handy if you want to use a program to upload shots from the camera to your website at regular intervals. No propritary software needed to get images, view everything from HTTP or a browser",0
4126,"More than I expected. I ordered this hoping for a protective yet sleek and fashionable bag.  I bought the Miami messenger bag and have been very pleased with it.  When I received it I noticed there was much more room than I thought from the pictures.  There is plenty of extra space without making the bag seem bulky. My notebook was a little smaller than the 17"" screen this bag accommodates but with the adjustable divider it still fits well. I have been very pleased and I think my husband is jealous of my bag now",0
4127,great addition to a great camera. I recently ordered this for a week long trip I was planning to Olympic National Park.  WOW what a great find.  I didn't have to worry about how many pictures my memory card would hold and could just snap away.  I think it also increased my shutter speed too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and have actually,0
4128,"Great sound quality, but silly design. Great, crisp, full Sennheiser sound in a small package. I am using this on my 20GB Creative Zen Touch and my HP laptop, sounds way better than the included Creative earbuds on both devices. Can't really go wrong for the price.The design of the earbuds? Okay, well there's this carrying case that's included, and it's sort of half wind-up, half take-it-out-and-completely-give-up-and-get-it-into-a-tangled-mess-anyway. I have a set of Javo eBuds for my cell phone and I love the windup design of these and wish the Sennheisers were similar. The cord is too short. There are also no foam ear pads included, minor annoyance.Overall: Great set of earbuds, love the sound quality, but I would gladly pay more if anyone out there has something without such a thoughtless design",0
4129,"An easy entry point for beginners. After a year of guitar, I was interested in a little musical cross-training.  I had been looking at these keyboards at some of the brick and mortar music stores, but was unsure of whether to take the plunge.  Amazon's price for the refurbished model closed the deal for me.  For a very low price, you can buy the keyboard and a music book.  I just had my first learning session with this, and am very pleased with the purchase.  A year or two down the road, I may trade up to a real keyboard, but this one is certainly fine for learning.  My guitar is also from Yamaha.  They really do make great instruments, at very reasonable prices.  This refurbished keyboard is in new condition.  I only know that it's refurbished because of the marking on the packing box.  Also, I found the included DVD to be helpful.  I'm using 6 regular AA batteries with this, but plan to switch to rechargeable batteries",0
4130,"Player is Great, but hope you never need support from COWON... This would have received a 5 if it weren't for the horrible customer service from COWON.  Buyer beware, and set your expectations very low for their support.  At all times I treated them with respect, never cursed or acted irate, which I must say was very difficult to do considering the way they treated me, a new customer.1) The only way to ""speak"" with support is through online chat or email.  They do not have working phone numbers for support.2) I received 1 player, DOA.  Replacement player also DOA.  It literally took 4 weeks before I received a working player since they do not offer cross shipping for defective products (they email a UPS ground shipping label, once unit arrives it sits in their queue for 5 business days, then they send the replacement via UPS ground)3) It does not matter how professional you treat the support team, they will treat you like you are inconveniencing them.4) They will not let you speak with a supervisor, they can only relay your chat to them5) Check the Better Business Bureau rating, its currently an FI really don't like being so negative about COWON but this whole experience left me wishing they didn't have such a technological superior product.  I encouraged them to alter their treatment of their customers, never received a response.  Even sent them a letter, no response.Their players are great, the customer support is the worst I have ever encountered",0
4131,"Awesome. This adaptor is great, especially for the price.  Installation was as easy as it gets, right out of the box.  I had it up and running through a WEP-enabled local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes.  It locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection.  Both FrontPage and ClieMail ran fine.  Speed is maybe 80% of what I get on my laptop running a 333 MHz. Celeron and a PC card 802.11b adaptor.  Just be sure your PDA is on the (small) list of supported devices.Negatives: it's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world.  I wouldn't leave it in the Clie when not in use and I sure wouldn't want to drop it on the floor.It does chew through the battery, but not any more than the backlight.  I did a test with my UX40, with the backlight set at minimum (ie. not off entirely) and using CliePet's UnderClock app to slow it down to 96 MHz.  This is a good combination of power saving and usability.Then I got on the net and loaded pages non-stop.  Starting from a fully charged battery, it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm.  I was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that.  I consider that perfectly acceptable.  With an EB40 extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it.Overall, a great add-on for a fraction of the price of a UX50",0
4132,Nice Drive - Sony DRX-810UL. I'm really happy with this drive. Installation was quick and easy. I've made a few copies of DVD disc on Verbatim 16X DVD-R media with absolutely no issues. Fast with exellent results,0
4133,Yamaha reciever. I just bought this item 1 week ago and i love it. I replaced my pioneer reciever which finally gave way. It is easy to use and the sound it great. I did not need alot of watts per channel i live in an apt so the 550 watts of power it offered was great. It does the job and the price was right. I recommend this product. It beats my old pioneer and yamaha has been around in the business of music equipment for along time you can trust the name,0
4134,Great HDMI. this dvd player is exactly what i was looking for. i have had no problems so far with the player. the main reason i got the player was to try out the HDMI of my LCD tv. the picture is perfect i can finally view my dvds in HDMI. plays everything i put in the player.,0
4135,Bought two of them. I bought two of these radios for my two sons and they have both said it  is a great product with magnificent sound quality.  I would certainly buy it again,0
4136,"Superb!!!. I bought this card after I got a Logitech Z-2300 speaker system.  It made a huge difference in the overall listening experience.  Highly recommend it, especially if you're currently using your on-board sound chip and have decent 2.1 speakers.  You will get optimal performance if you connect the analog audio output from your PC's CD drive directly to the card rather than going through the motherboard.",0
4137,"ONLY CDR's I EVER Use!. I started burning my own CDR's 5 years ago when I finally got a stereo-unit CD burner. I've mainly only been making mix CD's for my friends and compilation CD's to trim down the size of my extensive CD collection. By far, these Music CDR's from Maxell are THE BEST out there! Over the years, I've had very few problems with them, whereas with other brands I can't even begin to list the problems I've had without getting dizzy from the sheer astronomical number of problems.The only problem I have, is that these CDR's are getting harder and harder to find. 4 years ago I was able to pick up 10 packs of them(in standard-sized jewel cases, which I prefer) at any Walmart or K-Mart in my area. Now I have to resort to searching for them online. I want to stock up on them before they are completely discontinued, and I highly suggest that everyone else out there who's interested in TOP-QUALITY CDR's do the same",0

4142,"Definitly worth it if you want the best. This cable isn't cheap. So why pay so much for it? Why not just buy a cheap s-video cable? Because the quality suffers. They don't just jack up the price for no reason. Gold tipped connecters, more shielding from interference, thicker wire, and better quality materials used provides a better picture. Colors are more vibrant, the whole picture more defined. You get what you pay for, and this Monster Cable is definitly proof of that. I have this cable and it is worth it. Monster all the way",0
4143,"PERFECT. I've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems.  A GE set and a 2.4 gig Uniden set.This is by far the best.  Actually, it's perfect.  No noise on the line at all.  Everything just works perfectly.Only one caution. This particular model does not have an answering machine.  I was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did.  If you want an answering machine to come with, make sure you buy the right model.I'm totally sold on the DECT 6.0!!!!Buy it.  You won't regret it.",0
4144,"Great dock for price!. This is a good deal at the low Amazon price. The only problem I had was the USB cable that came with the unit was defective. I used another spare cable and it worked fine. The remote is a little cheesy, but it does work. Some of the buttons have a weird symbol that takes some experimenting to figure out.Soooo, overall this is well worth the price. It was compatible with my G5 60 Gb video iPod",0
4145,"Can't hear the television!. Blocks out enough noise that I can hardly hear my boyfriend blasting the TV at night, but can still hear the alarm clock by my head to wake up in the morning.These ear plugs are relationship savers. Inexpensive enough that when the parrot chews 'em up, it's not a huge loss",0
4146,"Great price, easy to use!!. I bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really, if you're new to this technology, you're not going to have any problems..believe me..A++",0

I purchased this item to take with me on a trip across the U.S.  My husband and I were able to send postcards, with our pictures and places we had seen, to our small grandchildren.  It is portable, easy as pie to use and we love it. Take pictures with your digital camera, hook up to the machine and print.  That easy.  Pictures are wonderful and color is great.  We were not disappointed.  We could also download pictures to our laptop, edit them, and then print them.  Just took a few minutes during our downtime in the evenings at our hotels, then we'd mail them the following morning before taking off again.  Got so many oohs and aahs from the desk clerks.",0

I know this because my friend owns a ipod and i like my Zen much much better. Not only is this Zen cheaper it stores more music and dont worry about how thick it is. It make the Zen more durrable because I have dropped mine many many times and it works perfect. The only problem I have ever had with this product is. That after 3 months the left earphone would not work so i sent it back and its perfect now. It also has Great sound qualiy. Also I am a kid and NOT hello kitty Mommy im her son lol,0
4165,"Good For Me. I upgraded from using a business mic to one of these and came to be very happy. The mic has high clarity-- certainly it is more than adequately sensitive. It also picks up a signal which, though less stereo than some, nonetheless provides a signal bifurcated enough to allow the listener to place objects by ear. The mic is very small and light, and appears very sturdy. It has been ideal for my use with a Sony MD Recorder. It has definitely helped me to improve the sweetness and clarity of my audio projects",0

4178,Fast SD card for my digital camera. I bought this SD card and took some 100 snaps out of it.The card is really fast with my canon A510 camera.Reading takes a slightly longer time than writing.I would recommend this card to anyone.Actually this card outperforms the 16MB MMC supplied with the camera.Also the 256MB card will hold upto 200 (may be lesser) 3.2MP pictures.,0
4179,I love it. I bought this fan today at Walmart (for $47.94).  I needed something to cool my medium size office (18'x18').The fan was easy to put together.  I placed it across the room from my desk and within five minutes temperature had noticeably dropped.The remote control is great and the timer feature means I don't have to remember to turn it off before I leave each day.,0

I do periodically check the backups and do a restore (always a good idea with any backup method) and it works flawlessly. In fact I purchased 2 more drives. I use one at work and the second here at home to archive photo's and music. Drive read/write time might not be as fast as others I looked at but for what I use it for, it's perfect and the price/Gb is right, and so far, excellent dependibility and easy to set up.

I have had this CF card for nearly a year (A year ago, it cost nearly $300--boy those CF memory prices have dropped!) and it has worked without incident where I use it for MP3/WMA storage on my iPAQ PDA. It does not appear to cause a significant power drain on my iPAQ battery, so it must be a fairly efficient chip. The write speed of this chip is roughly 40% slower than a Sandisk Ultra II CF, which is preferrable for digital cameras. For reliable storage and backup applications though, this 2GB CF is now an excellent value",0
4189,"Great Product!. I'm very happy with my labeler. I don't know how I live without it all these years. This model is very easy to use, I found out my thumbs are quite coordinated, as I seem to use my thumbs for typing and to change the options. As far as the battery issue goes, the battery prompt came up during the first two full rolls of tape, and the batteries never actually died (It doesn't come with batteries, so I used a couple used ones). I turn it off after each label, which is simply the touch of a button. When you power it back up, theres no waiting, it continues just where you left over, immediately. I wish the tape rolls were less expensive at $10 each. However, the first couple days, I went through 2 rolls like nothing. Now a month later, I'm still on my third roll. Once the house and office were labeled, it's just a matter of labeling here and there, and roll lasts quite a while. I was only able to find this brand roll at Office Max, Kmart and Walmart didn't carry them. Overall, the product was a good buy and I'm very satisfied with it, and the options it comes with",0

4193,"Smooth as Silk (so far at least!). This PSU looks great and performs great. I am using it to power an ASUS A8R32-MVP motherboard, AMD Athlon FX-60 CPU, ATI X1900XT-X graphics card, four SATA II hard drives, couple of DVD drives, high-end audio card from Germany, and other miscellaneous components. So far, it has done this without even a hiccup.I have a fairly tall case, so it was easy to tuck the extra power cables away. Some folks may prefer a PSU with modular cables, which I have in another computer, but I usually end up using most of the cables anyway.Connection of the main power cable, however, did require a glance at the manual (at least it did for me) because all of my motherboards use a 24-pin connector, whereas OCZ has split their Outlet Power connector into a 20-pin cable and a 4-pin cable. It was not intuitively obvious to me how these two parts connected",0
4194,"Atheros Chipset for Geeks means decent operation for everybody. High end users and users who consider themselves geeks will find this card useful.  The chipset allows for direct and immediate integration into Linux systems with no additional work on most platforms.  The chipset is also able to be used in special modes by a number of Windows applications.For any users at all, the card will do a decent job of operation with a good range and sensitivity.This card does not include an external antenna jack, however.  And in certain modes in Windows, it has a bad habit of SSID loopback.  This causes occasional issues with the card claiming that it can see its home network even if the network is far out of range.  This may cause confusion for some users as they try to connect to the network and are unable to.  Investigation revealed this to be an issue specifically caused by Windows' interaction with the card, and not the card itself, as it works fine in other operating systems.  Also, in the time that I have used it, I have only experienced this error once.Overall, the card is well worth the cost, especially if you are looking for that chipset.  The decent performance in my opinion outweighs the very infrequent trouble with SSID loopback.  if you are looking for the chipset for a linux machine, this card is excellent",0
4195,"I got my money's worth. For $30, it's worth it. I found no problems with the quality of sound with the headset it came with. I just wanted a simple, cheap mp3 that can hold a good percentage of songs for my walks....and this does it. I didn't have to install any programs, my computer just recognized it as a USB drive and I transferred my songs quickly.Some things I wish it had?- an on/off button. I read the manual and stuff, but nowhere did it say on/off button...but I think if you leave it alone for a little bit, it turns off by itself. (correction:  just hold the play button for a little bit, and it'll turn it off!)- a mode switch between the voice recorder/mp3. I have accidentally pressed the voice recorder a couple of times and I couldn't switch back to the mp3 without taking out the battery.- a way to browse through the music. All it has is a scroll on its side and that's how you go from one song to the next.But nonetheless, I got what I want. A cheap, functional mp3 that can suit my needs.

4199,"Finally, rechargables without self-discharge. I had always been frustrated in grabbing the digital camera (Minolta S404, using 4 AAs). We'd have to ""schedule"" it because by the time we went to grab it, the NiMH batteries would have discharged to the point that a few pictures would shut the camera down. Of course, recharging on the spot is not an option, and leaving the batteries in a charger all the time isn't a good thing either.While the Eneloops have a lower capacity (""merely"" 2000MaH), so far they've worked exactly as advertised.We'll see how they hold up over time, but until then, if your digital camera uses AA or AAA batteries, buy 2 sets _immediately_.We'll see if they can be beneficial as an alkaline replacement as well on some RC toys.

The heat pump warms the air in the winter, but does nothing for the dampness.I bought the Soleus one year ago.  I cannot believe how much moisture it takes out of the air.  I empty the bucket every morning and night.  The machine has different settings so you can choose how dry you want the air.  The quiet setting works just fine in our home and the machine is very quiet in that mode.  It does generate some heat when it runs, but seeing as it is winter anyway, the heat is welcome.  The Soleus is a snap to maintain, very lightweight and well worth the money.  You can set up a hose to automatically drain the water too.  Our house is 1,450 square feet of living area and the Soleus makes the entire house comfortable.",0

4225,"Best bang for the buck. I bought this projector about a year ago (I am also using it with my PC now as I write this) and it has not let me down once.  Regular (non-HD) programming is marginal at best but that is a problem with almost any projector or plasma TV for that matter.  DVD's, PC and console games as well as HDTV (especially sports) are nothing short of amazing.  I have a 92"" screen in a mostly dark room but I can also use it with the lights on in this room without any issues (the lights are on now as I write this).  I have the bulb on economy mode and you can barely tell when you switch from full mode to economy mode.  Economy mode is supposed to make the bulb last 30% longer so the very small difference between economy mode and full mode is not enough for me to sacrifice 30% of bulb life.  We use it every day to watch TV or for work.  The ONLY small knock on this is that there is little contract between the darkest shades of dark blacks.  Since I am not a video expert, this may be able to be fixed through adjustments but I am not bothered by this problem enough to try it.  I have considered projectors 1.5 to 2 times the cost of this one but the performance of this one stacks up with them and it is tiny.  I have friends who have projectors that they spent a whole lot more for and they are huge eye sores in the middle of the room.  This one performs as well if not better than that one and it is smaller than your standard dictionary",0

4227,"Magnificent beast of a TV. We have had this TV for 3 days now and are very pleased thus far. Amazon had an amazing deal (which they unfortunately no longer have) through TigerDirect and we managed to purchase this for $779.99 flat with free shipping.The picture and image quality are phenomenal and comparable to the LCDs and plasmas we looked at in Circuit City and Best Buy. The colors (especially the reds, blues and greens) are extremely vivid and sharp, especially with nature shows. The image seems to get a bit grainy when you have dark scenes in movies, but nothing worth crying over. Standard def programs don't look that great, but I think that may be a factor of our digital cable company and not the TV itself. HD programs, however, are SPECTACULAR. We upgraded our digital cable box from Time Warner to HD and set the output at 720p and we are hooked watching even the most crappiest of HD shows.Viewing angle is good. We agree that you lose picture at around 45 degrees. But for our small living room, we're usually watching head on so it's not a problem.For gaming purposes, we hooked our XBox360 up using Monster HD component cables and it is STUNNING. Better than an arcade and in the comfort of your own home. Marvel Ultimate Alliance went from something where you didn't know if you were beating up your fellow team members or the enemies on our old reliable 19"" to Spiderman and Captain America running around in your living room destroying Doombots.Sound quality is not on par with the picture quality, but acceptable. Again, in our small confines, we didn't even need to hook up to our speakers and it was fine. Nothing to complain about.Remote doesn't look cool, but is easy to use and allows you to switch inputs, which is nice. TV itself is nicely designed, and is actually not that bulky for a 42"".Connections are mislabled as other users have pointed out: composite (1 in), S-Video (1 in), component (2 in), HDMI (2 in) - ONLY 1!!!, RF (1 in), PC VGA (1 in.) - NONE!!! There is something that looks like a VGA input that is not addressed in the instruction manual, but we checked with Toshiba and we think it is an output for updating firmware/servicing.The PIP/POP/PDB options are great and vast. You can switch audio between your 2 sources to whichever you like. You can have XBox on one screen and a TV show on the other. Only thing is you will need to purchase a separate HDMI cable to use PIP (one source must be HDMI, the other can be any of the other sources).Delivery took approximately 1 week and came by special truck freight. They called in advance and were courteous, but there was only 1 poor guy to do the work, so my husband had to lend a hand.Again, we are very pleased with this purchase. Our only concern now is about the DLP lamp blowing after a few months of usage. The 50"" model have a few negative comments on Amazon about lamp reliability, but overall good reviews.Short term review - 5+ stars. Long term review - only the future will tell.",0

4241,"Scrabblers without Squabble. This recent purchase was actually for a gift; however, I have had the opportunity to tinker with it and get the input of the end user, my 75 year-old father.   My father is still getting used to it and discovering all of its capabilities.  He likes it as an accessory not actually replacing the hard bound dictionary which shows all the spellings close to the words that are searched.  I found the device to be user friendly to those not savvy to computers and/or current electronics.When it comes to challenging a player, it has been quite interesting to obtain such instant results with the capability of prompting for the definition, and the response you are given when the word does not exist.Because the size is so compact without compromising the the size of the screen and ability to see the screen, it is great for taking along in the car or a plane trip because the game features make it intersting enough in which to stay engaged.I am pleased with my purchase.",0

4243,"Ultimate iPod Case. If want the ultimate protection for your 30 or 60 GB Apple iPod, then the iSkin eVo3 is for you.A few months ago I purchased my 60GB Video from the apple store. In addition, I bought the iSkin eVo3 and it has been the best accessory I have gotten so far.  It has kept my $400 investment in flawless condition.  In fact, when I cleaned the case recently my iPod looked as it did on the day it arrived.There are many aspects of the case that make it a great buy and they are as follows:(1)  Seemless design, it looks like a product designed by apple.  It fits so perfectly well around the unit that, on occassion, some question if it is the next generation of apple's ipod or some competing brand. It is simply beautiful.(2)  Offers shock resistance with the soft rubberized outer shell.(3)  It makes your iPod virtually scratch proof as, once the case is on, there are no exposed surfaces except for the tiny holes on the back that serve as heat vents.  Everything is protected including the click wheel which - wonderfully - is not impeded by the covering.  In addition, your screen is perfecty safe under the crystal clear hard plastic shield.(4)  Offers water resistance as the skin is practically air tight around your iPod.To sum it up it is the ""ultimate iPod case"".  Portability, protection, and seemless beauty in one... that is definitely worth the price.Now there a few minor critisms - so minor they might not be even worth mentioning.  However, that is why this isn't the perfect iPod case and why it got only four stars from me:(1)  It's a laborious task getting the skin on and off your iPod, so if you use an armband to go running it will be a little bit of a pain, if you use a docking device, or a cartridge device like the Altec Lansing iM7 it will be a bit of a pain.  But that inconvience is minor.  In fact, I stopped using my armband, the case with the belt clip is all you need and will protect your iPod better than any armband on the market.(2)  The air vents on the back, I feel are unnecessary.  The iPod would be water tight if it wasn't for them. But again... minor.(3)  The rubbery part of the case does collect dust easily, yet it is painfully easy to clean.(4)  Finally, you can't use the hold button without physically altering and cutting the skin...  I never use the hold button, so it is not a big deal to me.  However it does mark exactly where you would cut should want to; making me believe it would be quite easy.I would give this case a 4.9 if I could falling just short of the perfect iPod case/skin.",0

4251,"Very Good Value for the Price. This keyboard is a very good value.  It has only a PS2 connection, so if you need to use USB you will need a converter plug. I needed a PS2, so it was OK for me.

Keys are quiet and require minimal pressure.  Has a top row of quick link keys including Favorites, Mail, Homepage and Music and others.  Nothing fancy, but if you need a simple, quiet keyboard this one will work well for you",0
4252,"Good value. Really, it is hard to go wrong when purchasing an LCD TV.  Just look for something that is HD, has at least 800:1 contrast ratio and 8 msec refresh rate and is as cheap as possible.  This is a very good TV, with a very good picture, and a very low price.The only major downside with this TV is that is only 720p or 1080i, instead of 1080p.  720p and 1080i are fine for most applications, including HDTV.  But if you want to look to future, you might want a 1080p TV.  The newer HD DVD systems (Blue Ray and HDDVD) and Play Station 3 require 1080p for the best picture.  Personally, I don't think HD DVD will really take off (but I could be wrong) and I am not going to get a Play Station 3, but I would still get a 1080p TV, just in case.  However, I don't think you will find a 1080p LCD TV anywhere close to this price range.The other minor downside to this TV is that it is a little confusing to setup.  It comes with a sheet of quick setup instructions, but there is no paper owners manual.  The owners manual is on CD, or you go online to view it.The default mode on this TV is that the normal antenna connection that you would use for cable TV is disabled.  So, you have to go through the menus on the TV to figure out how to enable the antenna hookup.  After that, you have to instruct the TV to do a channel search, both analog and digital.The TV comes with an ASTC tuner, so that you can get HD channels off the air (for free).  However, getting HD channels off the air can be difficult.  If you get poor reception in your area, then you won't be able to get the HD channels.  Locking on the HD channels is more difficult than the old analog channels.  If you don't have a rooftop antenna on you house, then you need to get rabbit ears.  Then it is like being back in the 1960's with screwing around with antenna placement to get a signal.  I get the best signal with old rabbit ears that my kids broke off, and touching them to a wrought iron stand.  I have been thinking of bringing out the aluminum foil.The TV also has a QOM tuner, so that you can get the HD channels directly off of cable, without getting a special cable box.  For most cable systems, you can pick up all the local HD stations they offer on basic cable (in the Bay Area, it is only 5 of the 12 local stations).  You can pick up ESPN in HD if you have the expanded basic service.  The only thing you can't get is the premium channels like HBO.  For HBO in HD you will still need a cablebox.On most LCD TV's you get right now, the default setup for the picture quality is not optimally set up.  This is especially true for standard analog TV.  When you first hook up an LCD TV, the picture can look pretty bad.  You will need to go in and adjust the color, contrast and other settings to get the best picture quality.  Although the defaults on the Olevia were better than some others I have seen.Although Syntax and Olevia are relatively new names they are recognized as one of the leaders in LCD TV's.  It is hard to go wrong with this TV.In the end, I recommend choosing the size TV you need, deciding if you really need 1080p, and then buying the cheapest TV you can find.",0

4263,"Better than average, does it's job. First off let me tell you what equipment I'm running with it.It's a basic set up:DLP TV, Sony DVD player, Directv DVR, Pioneer receiver. HDMI only running from DVD to tv.Very basic. First of all the programming via the web was a breeze really. No hangups as so many have mentioned. I was done in 20 minutes. Basically as long as you can get the names and model numbers of your equipment you are ok. I called Direct TV to get the exact model number of my DVR.After programming, oh and I have DSL internet, so it wasn't slow, the remote immediately took over for my others. It worked right off.Some have mentioned syncing problems. If you don't leave the remote facing the devices long enough when you use the activity selections(watch TV, watch DVD, listen to radio etc.) then sometimes it will turn on the first couple of components and not the other, but the help function quickly takes care of this. You can also get it all back in synch if you simply press the device button and turn off the other equipment then start new with the activities button again.I haven't really had problems with reading the screen as many have mentioned and the functions are pretty easy to come by as soon as you get used to the layout of the remote. It turns itself off after two hours of non use and when you pick it up it turns itself back on.The reason behind this particular remote purchase for me was ease of set up and the activities buttons layout. I wanted something that would be user friendly so when I have someone watching my house they could easily perform the basic functions of the system like watching a dvd without hitting wrong buttons and messing up presets and such on the receiver or things like that.The only reason I don't give this five stars is that the remote does feel a bit on the fragile side and if you have kids I could see them dishes out some mean punishment on this thing. For instance if you press on the soft number buttons to harshly they can get stuck under the casing. This happened once. Not a big deal but still.I would say this is not a child friendly remote and let them use the ones that came with the devices instead.Other than that. Great product and so far so good",0
4264,"Perfect Vista Tuner. Getting the Tuner to work was as easy as pointing driver installation to the drivers folder on the included winTV disc.

4266,"Just Amazing !!!!!. The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if  I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home.Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before.I will address the concerns of a few reviews here.1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD  audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound.2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc.3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc.4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I  bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black.Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00.5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle.Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one.But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables.",0

4268,"How many pictures will it store?. How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 1GB SD Card SD1GB -32-231, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card.  Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available.  A 1000MB card should be an investment.  You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity.  Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted.  Then what do you do?  Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs",0

4270,"The best PC joystick on the market !. I have owned the CH Products Fighterstick for a little over a month now and I am now ready to compose a full review. I have been a MS Sidewinder force feedback2 user for years. I was very happy with that stick but when I started playing Lock On I decided that it was time to step up to the plate and purchase a real HOTAS system. At first glance the fighterstick appears to be built to last. It is constructed of very heavy gauge plastic and all of the devices seams are sealed properly. It is not flimsy or fragile in appearance or feel.The stick only comes with an instruction sheet. There is no owners Manual or software disk included. The new owner must download the drivers and CH Control Manager software from the CH website. Setup is a very simple operation which involves plugging your stick into it's own USB port and running the drivers software. Setup was completed without a hitch and I did not miss the absent owners Manuel. I then proceeded to use the CH Manager software to configure the stick for the first time. It was at this time that I encountered my first and only problem while using the software. While attempting to configure the Y axis I noticed that the stick's signal would jump from one end of the scale to the other with very little movement from the stick itself. I could not figure out what the problem was on my own so I called CH customer service and they told me to be sure and center the two trim wheels before configuration. Sure enough after I corrected the position of the two wheels, the configuration process was completed without a problem.Next, I ran Lock On in order to put the stick through it's first flight trials. The Fighterstick fits my medium sized hand very well. My only complaint is the fact that button #2 is located very high on the stick and is hard for me to reach without repositioning my hand. I believe this is due to the fact that this stick is based on the design of the F-16 joystick configuration. The problem with this choice of design styles is that the real F-16 stick is mounted between the legs and at about waist height inside the cockpit, where as the CH Fighterstick will be mounted on some ones desktop. This creates an ergonomic problem that the F-16 design was not meant to handle. Beside my issue with button #2, I have experienced no other problems with manipulation of the stick ingame.Stick response and accuracy are very good. I can pull all kinds of high ""G"" maneuvers, fire all kinds of weapons and deploy my counter measures with a level of speed and accuracy that I have never experienced before. All the buttons work as programmed and the x/y axis is very smooth. Some say that the springs in the stick base are very lite. I don't feel that there is anything unusual or loose concerning the feel of this stick. I am very comfortable with the level of tension in the stick. Keep in mind that I have been working with the Sidewinder up to this point and that this may be the reason why I don't have a problem with the level of tension in the stick.CH Control Manager is a wonderful program that gives you the ability to adjust all of the sticks important settings. It also allows you to create your own personal button program maps which can be loaded or saved for future use. CH Control Manager does not come with a tutorial so you will need to consult with an experienced user in order to fill in the blanks left after you have read the online user guide, as I did. After asking a few questions on an internet user forum I was ready to begin programing the stick for the first time. Once you know how to use it, CH Control Manager is a joy to work with. However it is not as intuitive as I would have liked it to have been.The CH products Fighterstick is considered the top of the line PC flight controller. Unlike Thrustmaster's best stick it doesn't have any outstanding quality control issues. The Fighterstick has an excellent maintenance record and I am confident that it will last me for many years of flight siming fun.Update: I stand corrected on the position of the stick in the real F-16, however I stand by my criticism of the feel of the stick when used in the desktop position. Thanks to the PC cockpit I now use, I no longer experience this problem",0
4271,"Superb and never die out batteries. These batteries are far stable and durable in long term use. I have owned non-brand name and Kodak rechargeable batteries. They are either unstable voltage output or die out much earlier than their publicized life-span. Sometimes one in pair die out then other remains(Not SONY). I can't use them for the digital camera power source because it requires delicate and stable voltage supply.Those SONY batteries seemed not to go down voltage levels and when their charge are drained, the pair(2 batteries) go down together.It's perfect use for an equipment that needs constant and stable power supply, like digital camera",0
4272,"Works great, but live support  may be a wait. Newbie to wireless. Bought this one because I wanted to keep it simple, and this one apparently does that well- better than some much higher-priced models. My brand new Vista notebook (Dell) works fine with this. Didn't add any alternate firmware either.Have never had any problems getting onto or staying on my network in the two months I've had this. Also was able to easily pick up networks at various airports and to get online while visiting a condo community network that other laptops couldn't access.Only reason I haven't given it a 5 is that it often takes a 30-minute plus wait to get to a human in their 24/7 tech support. I think Buffalo could improve this, but most reviews seem to indicate that you'll almost never need to contact them. They have been very patient and helpful both times I did work with them.I just added AES encryption today with the help of tech support and will add comments later if I have any problems. Wish I'd thought to ask about adding intrusion protection, but it may be better to wait until Vista is more common to ask about that. Too many firewalls can be problematic.I'd buy it again.

4277,Great ! Transportable Mini Speakers. These speakers were purchased as part of a birthday present for my son.

These are NOT big boombox sound but great for a day at the beach or picnic etc. No regrets and would recommend for use with an MP3 player,0
4278,iPod U2 30 GB Special Edition - just great!. You'll never get disappointed with it...it's great,0
4279,"Great drive, wish the drive were attached to the lanyard, rather than the cap. I've had this USB drive for about a month and It's been terrific. I haven't noticed any speed issues, but I'm basically managing small files. I've had no trouble with it in Windows 2000, OS X and FreeBSD. My only complaint is that the cap is attached to the lanyard, not the drive itself. I can easily forsee a time when I reach for the drive and find that it has come unattached somewhere. This seems poinless to me, as there's a nice little latch on the lanyard to disconnect the CAP from the lanyard. If I'd looked more closely at the photos, I'd have figured this out. Still, I have no regrets",0

4281,Outstanding Educational Tool. I bought this for my freshman son and he loves it.  Not only can he use it for algebra but it also has organizer software that helps him stay on track at school.  Well worth the $$,0
4282,Fantastic!. Shipped very fast from pattyir...much faster than I thought it would.  The Belkin F5D8010 Wireless Pre-N 802.11x Pre-N Notebook PC Card Adapter works wonderfully.  Very easy setup and an immediate connection to the Internet. I'm very pleased,0
4283,"bang for the buck. A good no frills wall mount for your flat screen.  Good, heavy construction.  Plenty of hardware and excellent directions for mounting.  Finish was also good, no bare metal or unfinished surfaces.  Only horizontal adjustability, but good enough for most applications",0
4284,"EQ 200. Buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days, but I still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.Used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.The equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.It allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer",0
4285,"No reason not to like it!. I use these Sony tapes in my Sony DCR-TRV310 Digital 8 camcorder.  The quality is great, even after you record over it.  Sixty minutes in D8 is fine for me and I see no reason to disapprove of the tape's performance",0
4286,"Getting colors right for photo editing. Great product, and great price at amazon! I live in Malaysia, where the local price is 250% of Amazon's list price. For USD9$ (shipment) I had it delivered in Singapore in just a few days, and picked it up at my friend's place. First thing that came out when I plugged it in, was that my old monitor had lived its useful life. Althought the colors were still correct(able), the overall luminosity was so low that I could only work in a dark room to view the full scale. I bought a new LCD monitor, calibrated and profiled it in a few minutes (it wasn't quite right straight out of the box - too bright), and now all my pictures come out beautifully! I can display 256 shades of grey distinctively, which was previously impossible. It's not just photos, even the dull windows interface suddenly comes to life. Highly recommended to anyone with a DSLR and a desire to spend more than 5 minutes improving their pictures on photoshop.",0
4287,"Quality product with WRONG manual. WARNING: PSW10 does not have a single subwoofer socket. Instead, you need use L or R socket for its stereo inputs.Good quality. Sounds ok, matched with my purchase of a pair of R50.Recommended for entry level home theater system",0

4290,"One of the better cases available. I bought this case because I wanted good screen protection that didn't have to be attached to the iPod. I also needed access to the docking port (for my car stereo) while it is in the case, and a belt clip.The case fits perfectly around the iPod without any spacers. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the belt clip attaches very tightly to whatever you clip it to, but can be difficult to remove without using both hands.I don't have any scratches, but I know it's going to get scratched because it's made of plastic. If you can't live with that, then get something else",0

My church's Media Center uses the Optifix system, so I decided to try it, too. The scratch was gone, and the DVD plays with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way; some scratches cannot be repaired at all. I just know that it worked great for me",0
4294,"Samsung LT-P1545 15"" Flat-Panel LCD TV. First, I would buy it again if I needed to.  This 15"" takes up less space on the kitchen counter, i.e., speakers are on the bottom. Second, picture and sound are excellent, i.e, clear.I would not buy this item if I wanted a true VESA mount to monitor configuration.  The stand, not the monitor, has the screw holes for the VESA wall mount.  Not enough or clear info in the description. However, it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall.  If you need counter space then buy something else.",0
4295,WR-300 Midland. Wonderful product with one exception - You have to reset it if there is no weather warnings/watches in a 10 day period.  The instruction booklet does not make it clear as to how to do this.  I tried several times to re-set my weather monitor and never could. Finally we had a thunderstorm warning in my county and it re-set itself once the warnings had expired,0

4297,"Excellent CD Player...so far. Ok, so I've only had this player 1 day. Still, it is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It plays all my ""trouble"" CDs like home-made CD-Rs that have some scratches. I love the snap that holds the cover down. I love that all the buttons are big and directly on the front cover - very easy to use. I went for a walk with this in a sholder bag and it never skipped. It DOES have the auto-resume feature where if you are listening to a CD and then turn off the unit...when you turn it back on it starts where you left off. The entire unit feels VERY solid, like it won't break. I also like the clean styling, no crazy designs, just a good player. ~ The user manual could be a little clearer, but with a little playing around everything makes sence. ~ One example is it doesn't have a ""stop"" button when playing CDs. You have to press the ""radio off"" button. Easy enough to figure out, but it doesn't say that in the manual.Overall, great product. I'm very happy with it.",0
4298,"As good as Monster, a fraction of the cost. I bought these from Amazon last fall to connect my DVD player to my new HD.  I did not want to shell out the $100 for monster cables and figured I could only loose $8 getting these.  They have worked out very well!  I am very impressed with the signal quality.  I compared my picture recently to a friends.  While we both have rear project HD sets, we have different brands of TV and DVD.  He has monster cables.  I did not see any difference in the appearance compared to my setup.Save yourself the money and get these.  They work great",0
4299,"great little printer. I received the cp720 model along with a canon digital camera and I am thoroughly impressed by the quality of prints that this prints- I would have believed that these photos were printed from a lab if I didn't know otherwise.The replacement ink cartridge is extremely easy to use and replace, no mess. They are designed for a specific number of prints and they work great right up until the end, so there are no faded pictures when your ink is low.The photo paper is very nice, thick stock, and glossy, with perforated edges.You are limited to paper by the manufacturer, but refills are reasonably priced, compared to getting prints professionally made",0
4300,"Nice case for a 15.4"" Laptop. Good value in this bag.  It serves my purposes well in transporting my 15.4"" laptop to and from work.  The only thing I would recommend the manuf. to change would be to make the small pouch for the cell phone out of leather also",0
4301,"Garmin USB Data card programmer. It would be impracticale to buy a memory card larger than 32 meg without buying this product.  I had the 32 meg memory card, and it took about 8 hours to load the maps in using a serial connection (cut the battery life in half while flashing).  Now I flash a 128 meg card with the usb programmer, and the total time to load ~127 megs of maps (including indexing time) is about 13 minutes.  This was on a 400 MHz Windows 2000 computer.  If you have a faster computer, it may be able to index the maps faster. I highly recommend this product",0

As much as I like the MP450, I use it for photo printing mostly, and must say I'm still looking for a printer that represents black better.Comparing photos from an actual lab to the MP450's output, the print doesn't use the black cartridge when printing color, so black is generated by mixing all available colors, resulting in a grayish tone instead of black.Other than that, it's a fine printer",0

4310,"Works well, but tricky to set up. I received this unit via my home insurance after my RCA 5-disc changer was stolen.The unit itself is solidly built, and I don't have any issues with the playback performance or picture quality. I think if you get this unit, you'll be pretty happy with it.What stinks is the documentation, remote, and setup.The manual is your typical poorly-translated engrish guide that most people have come to expect from inexpensive electronics. Fortunately, if you've had any experience setting up a DVD player, there's not much different here.Unless you want progressive scan.Here's what you have to do if you want to use progressive scan mode:1. Connect both the component cables AND an S-Video (or composite) cable to your TV. Hopefully it has both inputs (most HDTVs do).2. Put your TV on the S-Video (or composite) input.3. Enter the Setup menu (not to be confused with the Options menu!) and choose Progressive output.4. Now you can unhook the S-Video (or composite) cable and put your TV on Component input mode.Thankfully this is a one-time hassle, but it's still assinine that Panasonic couldn't have either designed an autodetect or used a physical switch like my old RCA had. With the RCA, I just hooked up the component cables, flipped the switch, and set up the DVD player for 16:9 aspect ratio and I was done.Lastly, the dreaded H07 error. I think I figured out what's probably causing the majority of them: when you eject the tray, the currently playing CD/DVD is still on the motor and continues to play. A neat feature for swapping the other discs without interrupting your music, but the upshot is that the ejected tray has an empty slot in it.Can you guess what happens if you accidently put another CD/DVD into the seemingly empty slot by mistake?To avoid this, instead of using the Eject function, use the Swap function. This will stop the playback and make sure all the discs are out of the drive and avoid damage.Overall, a great player for the price. Just be careful with it and bear with the tricky setup",0

While nothing will stop a determined thief I believe this is the best security available.  It's well thought out, easy to use, and simply looks tough.  It slips into a laptop bag easily yet it's long enough that you'll always be able to find something to attach it to.  I use it while travelling and even at home.I look at it this way.  Once you realize that there is a device like this available you have to buy it and use it.  Otherwise, you have no one to blame but yourself if your laptop is stolen",0

I needed a remote that would control atleast six components and the Magnavox PMDVR8-8 device remote was right for me. It also had three programable macro programs that come in handy. Did I mention a good remote at a great price? Well it is. Only down side was, like any universal replacement remote it will not replicate all the functions of the OEM remotes that it replaces. However I am more than well pleased with my choice of a universal remote and as always it's a pleasure doing business with Amazon",0

The guy at the next aisle probably can't see anything though",0
4323,wow!. Well I did a bunch of research before purchasing this projector.  I was a little leary as there is no location local to me that carries the thing so I was never able to witness it in person before ordering but no one seemed dissapointed.  And I can still say I know of no one that is.  This is an amazing projector for the price.  Even with only a progressive scan dvd player the picture if phenomenal.  The crispness is exceptionaly clear on complex scenes (Lord of the rings) or color differences (Sin City).  A superb product and a great price.Have not tried the HDMI interface yet however.  No real plans to either until the timing issues have been worked out in the standard.  So can't say how good the image is off that yet,0
4324,"High performance memory. I bought Sony's 1 GB MSX-1GN memory stick for use in Sony's new Cybershot DSC W7 camera.  The memory stick has performed exceptionally well.  I can store hundreds of high quality, 7 MB photos on it.  Or, I can store about 15 minutes of camcorder-quality video on it, recorded at full 640x480 and 30 fps.The chief qualities that set this memory stick apart (and probably why it costs more than other Pro memory sticks with the same storage capacity) are speed and durability.  On the durability side, all of the recent flash media, such as memory sticks, compact flash, and SD cards, are notoriously fragile and can be easily damaged by wide fluctuations in temperature and weather conditions.  Sony has ramped up the durability of this card dramatically, claiming that it can handle temperatures from -13 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit.  I'd have to see that to believe it, but nevertheless, it is a good thing to have a more durable card.The real advantage of this card, though, is its speed.  It can support read/write speeds of up to 80 megabits per second.  To put that in perspective, your typical cable or DSL broadband Internet connection can only handle 1 to 3 megabits of data per second.  And even the earlier Sony Pro media (for example, see their 1 GB Pro MSX-M1GS memory stick), though they were very good, could only support around 15 megabits per second.  So that makes you realize just how fast the new MSX-1GN really is.  It's important to remember that just because the memory stick supports such read/write speeds, that doesn't mean it will actually work that fast in your camera or other device.  Each device has its own bottlenecks and limitations, but the important point here is that the memory stick itself will never slow your device down. So if you buy a new hot rod digital camera that boasts of having very little ""lag"" time between shots, you can be sure that this memory stick will be able to keep up with the camera, so that you won't have to miss that perfect shot while waiting for the last picture to be written to memory.This is an excellent product, and I would highly recommend it.  My only regret is that the 2 GB card was not available at the time that I bought my camera.  An important point to take away is, Sony has lots of memory sticks with lots of model numbers.  But if you get one, make sure you get the latest ones in the ""GN"" series (as in, ""MSX-1GN"" for the 1 GB card, or ""MSX-2GN"" for the 2 GB card), because these are the ones with the great read/write speed.  Note that these sticks cost almost twice as much as the other Sony memory sticks of the same memory capacity, but be assured, they are well worth it and you should not hesitate to buy the faster ones.  Why would you want to shell out $400 to $1000 for a cool new camera, and then skimp on the memory and buy slow memory that causes you to miss great shots or take poor quality video clips",0
4325,"Goes Together Easily. I enjoyed putting this together. The spacers kinda threw me until I realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf. I got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the DVD shelves weren't spaced properly [CD sized] so I had to take it apart and redo it, but that wasn't too bad. The spacers snap apart easily enough, even for my feeble fingers.  It's not terribly sturdy [maybe I didn't get the poles screwed down tightly enough] but as long as it's in its permanent location, holds the multimedia well. I really like the way it looks. Bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one, too :",0
4326,"Very Clear Headphones. I had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since I work in a loud environment. I had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews weren't favorable. I was nervous. However, I bought these because of the name Altec Lansing has in audio. I was shocked when I first listened to them. I had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable. But wow! The clarity of these phones are incredible. No matter what others said about these, I found the bass to be tight, but not booming. If someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs, then they need to stay away from headphones period. If you are searching for a pair of IEMs, then if I were you, I would seriously consider this pair. Just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way, which I never really found that to be an issue. I don't really understand what others were doing wrong with that. If you bought these, I highly recommend it, you would not be sorry. I am thouroughly impressed with mine",0
4327,"From ""high end"" to ""bargain basement"". EXCELLENT IMAGE FOR LITTLE MONEY!I bought the Infocus X2 to replace a worn out and broken $15,000.00 ""high end"" CRT projector. My budget would not allow for a more appropriate replacement. While the X2 could never satisfy the true videophile, who usually spend anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000 dollars on a projector, it was never intended to.That being said, I will say that the Infocus X2 when being shown on my Stewart 100"" screen is projecting an impressive image that is pretty close to the $15,000 unit it replaced!  A true videophile will certainly see the difference, but your average person will not. With my limited budget, I am quite satisfied with the very good image quality.  DVDs are sharp and clear, TV is quite satisfactory also.If you are looking to enter the big screen front projector market, and you don't want to spend more than a thousand dollars, here you go!But seriously folks, even though it works, stop shining your projector on a wall....  get yourselves a screen. There are special reflective properties in a screen that a painted wall doesn't have to really bring your image to life.",0

It is so easy to use and very small and light so it can fit in your pocket.  It was extremely easy to download the music and figure out how to organize music folders.  It holds just about what is advertised which is approximately 200 - 250 songs.  However, I am sure the length of each song will determine how many can actually fit on this MP3 player.  The price was great - $50.  If you are a person who loves the radio, then get the Nano Plus.  Otherwise, this is a great player for someone who wants ease of use and does not have more than 250 songs in their collection of favorite music",0

4340,NuLOOQ-Excellent!. Logitech scored a big plus with this item.  The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly.  The first review is really unfair.  Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous.  Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did.  Good job on this one. I recommend it highly,0
4341,"Great MP3 for a great price. What I like about the e130 is I can use the sd cards (use the fast read write 60x and 130x) to play music so I can have a library of sd cards to plug in. I use 2 gb ones and the prices are really coming down on the sd cards.I use the online local library to check out audio books and use the FM transmitter (E100 Sandisk, bought separately) in my car to listen to on my way to work.  I modified the clear plastic case (removing the snaps) so I can use the clip (to shirt pocket, pants pockets) that came with the FM transmitter.I've had mine for about a year and really like the sound and yes, if you turn it off, then turn it on later, it picks up where it left off.The FM station comes in loud and clear.I use a rechargable AAA battery, that way it saves on the cost of batteries.I use different earphones that what came with it cause mainly the right earphone gave out on me, the earphones wasn't comfortable, and I wanted a better quality sound.

4343,"Good tape. Captures great in a Sony TR7000 camcorder. Works great in both Hi8 and  Digital8 modes, though only captures 60 minutes in Digital8 format. The  tapes retained clarity and sound quality after multiple edits. The material  of the tape is the second-highest quality used in Sony tapes",0
4344,"Good sticker system!. The sticker tape sticks to almost anything; Tree bark, windshields, toothbushes, even cat hair. To help my daughter learn Spanish, we labled eveything in and around the house in Spanish. Our Gato and Perros are labled, so are all the vacas y pollos. Her hermana y hermanos also got labeled, but the stickers do come off in the bath.",0
4345,"Flawless budget mini-stereo. I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture.",0
4346,"Finally a real UNIVERSAL remote. I love this remote. It actually has buttons for all the functions for my TiVo, LCD HD TV, AV REceiver. It's easy to program from the web site, just type in the make and model of your device, download and you're done. I finally have been able to put away all those remotes and use this one. Would highly recommend this product",0

4348,best changer in the world  !!!!!!!!!!!!!. I've had a number of changers from the carousel 5 disc changers to the 500 plus that go round and takes you a week to load . the PIO PD-M426 is a great answer to the ?s of why my old changer keeps playing the same song or the same disc and not the others . well its got a a little thing thats called a Random memory that remembers what it plays and what it didn't . the only thing I wish it did have was a headphone jack but other than that it's a great unit .,0
4349,"It's a USB cable, and it works. I bought this cable because it was pretty cheap, cables at my local electronics store were running for over $30...  I'm using this cable for my printer, and it does what it's supposed to do",0
4350,"Great Product for sharing a printer on a simple home network. I love the form factor. It simply plugs into the parallel port on the printer - no printer cable. It is a snap to set up if you just follow exactly the instructions in the Quick Installation Guide. I had it working with four computers, three Windows XP and one Ubuntu Linux, in less than an hour",0
4351,"Very Solid Component for the Price. Full, rich sound with a thoughtfully-organized rear panel and an impressive roster of DSP modes. Very easy to set up and use. My only complaint: The device can't remember individual channel settings for separate source inputs. For example, I like to watch DVDs with the center channel set at +5 dB, so that dialogue pops more clearly. But for music, I prefer to use a surround mode with the center channel at -5, which increases the field depth to my ears. With this receiver, that's impossible unless I want to get used to changing the settings every time I switch back and forth. Different DSP modes are retained for each source, but the more granular audio and channel settings are system-wide. Not a huge inconvenience, but important to know if you want a high level of control over your listening experience",0
4352,"Toshiba 32DF46 32 Super Great. The Picture and Audio quailty are excellent, and has excellent adjustments for color and audio.

4354,"jdpbecker. After much research into the Epson R2400 & R1800, I got the 2400.  I am absolutely impressed with the quality of pictures!  It does a phenominal job.  I have two other epson printers, one is the much older 800 which I took to work & am still using.  The other is the R200 that I use for general printing & printing on my cd's & dvd's.  I had a canon 9900 & I90 before.  The epson is far superior to the canon.  I liked the tech support at canon but I love the epson printers & have never had to use tech support.  Yes, the ink is hard to find.  It is a high end printer & your ordinary big box stores doesn't want to mess with it.  I order online & save money that way.  When I run out of one cartridge, I order 2 to replace it. The printer gives you plenty of warning so you don't run out.  I am an amateur photographer & do lots of scrapbooking.  I print all my own pictures with the Epson.  It's not your ordinary printer but I don't want ordinary pictures. I haven't been disappointed yet.  You just have to make sure you set the print settings for the media you are using.",0
4355,"Great sound; horrible cord. I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great.  The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles.  However, it is just right for me.  I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate.I have a pair of Grado SR-80 headphones, and a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones.  Each is a $100 conventional full-sized set of headphones, and yet I actually prefer the sound of the Sony earbuds.The only problem I have is that the cord is far too short without the extension, and far too long with the extension.  (A free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones.)  What were they thinking?  Also, the fact that the right ear's cord is so much longer than the left's is ridiculous.  Don't they have a focus group review these things?",0
4356,Great Karaoke System. This cartridge adds 200 songs to the basic system. I has a good variety of music that I like. I highly recommend it,0
4357,good item. i love the mobilemate sd.  I haven't had any problems yet.  It's small compact and gets the job done,0
4358,"Full of features. I like the features of this player.  However, the controls are a bit hard to use, and the start and stop controls make a loud beep that, if transmitted to an amplifier may damage the speakers. So watch out for that",0
4359,"Powerful control panel. I agree with the first reviewer in that it is hard to find reviews of this product anywhere online. After reading lukewarm reviews of other draft-n routers, I picked this one up on a whim, hoping for the best. I am extremely pleased. The other D-Link products I own are a mixed bag in terms of level of control in the firmware, with the DGL-4300 being leaps and bounds better than the DI-LB604. Luckily, the DIR-655 firmware is akin to the DGL-4300 in terms of control, features and flexibility. It's even a little snappier thanks to fewer graphics and has better Firefox compatibility.Setup was a breeze (if you know what you're doing, you don't need to insert the CD first as instructed by the unit -- just toss it) and though I haven't had it long connectivity has been stable for the past 24 hours. I have yet to try a Skype session, but the ""intelligent QoS engine"" promises improved call quality. Overall, I'm very satisfied",0

Just wanted to let you and everyone reading these know that the Axiom series is not actually the only aftertouch-capable m-audio keyboard, but I will also add that the other cheaper m-audio controllers, such as the keystation (not pro)and ozone series, have a very poor aftertouch, sometimes not even responding consistently (!).  Bottomline is I wouldn't expect to get a decent controller under $200 in my experience; the Axioms feel great to me and would recommend them to anyone looking for a capable controller on a budget",0

It is a bit messy cleaning a full bag, but that's why they invented vacuums. tall kitchen trash bags fit perfectly. I buy the draw string type so it's snap to remove and seal.

4363,"Excellent Home Phone System. I just got this set a week ago, and am so happy with it's performance. It has the loud and clea voice with a smart look with no antena. It has couple new features which I have never seen any cordless phone before. Like you can add your own sweet ring tone and your own wallpaper. My son just loves it when he sees his picture on it.I have the base phone 2nd floor and the other handset on the first floor and there is no noise at all. It's really attractive to look.I am only worried about the battery which is very good now , I hope it maintains it's strength for couple of years at least not like other Pana phone which works very good when they are new and after couple of years goes down.I have not bought the camera with it yet, no plans to buy too, so can't comment on that.Only thing I was expecting in this phone is a Belt Clip.If you are okay with the price, it's awsome.....",0
4364,"Killer sound quality, you won't be disappointed!!. The Shure the E2G's are were designed for use with portable video game devices like the Sony PSP. The audio clarity and response from these tiny earphones is fantastic!  Listening to digital sound using the E2Gs is great because the sound quality is fast, balanced, and accurate. I could actually pick out background sounds that I never noticed using other headphones - it's almost like having surround sound headphones on. I must warn you that although the mid-range frequencies are solid, and high frequency  is good as well, the bass falls short and may be too soft for some users.The sound isolation feature works pretty well. These earphones block out external noise (like people's voices, which noise-cancelling headphones are not designed for) allowing you to hear audio from your PSP more clearly. This feature also helps me to save battery life because I can keep the volume level lower  than with regular headphones.Overall, the E2G's deliver superb sound quality.  Just a warning, you might be shocked at the $100 price tag...I know I was.  But after using these for a few weeks I can't live without them!",0

Last week I recieved a nice box of birthday gifts that my sister purchased for me here through Amazon, and the flylight went into immediate use and ""test-mode."" It produces a nice low light glow that really helps for those late nights when you are browsing the internet on your laptop, and you don't want the glare of a table lamp messing with your screen just so you have enough light to type passwords, etc. This product really does the trick, and the flexibility is good enough to wrap around and give you light just where you need it. The neck is about 1 inch shorter than I would have liked it as my USB ports are located at the back of my unit, not the side, and an on-off switch would really help. It was probably left off as something else that could go wrong, but it really would make the unit more useable than having to search in the dark to plug it into the tiny USB port on the back...",0

4379,"Great way to get great wireless sound. I plugged this in last weekend for one my clients, and it works superbly. We connected one ZP80 to a set of Polk Atrium 45p speakers, and another ZP80 to a set of Advent AV70? speakers, and they sound great. I recommend these for use with smaller speakers, as they will deliver enough satisfactory sound. For larger speakers, though, I recommend the ZP100, with its built in amplifier.Set-up of the ZP80 was remarkably easy. I do wish the 2-minute ""activation"" period was a little bit longer so I wouldn't have to run around to connect each machine to the wireless subnet that the Sonos systems create and use.The remote is big, bulky, somewhat heavy, and the scroll wheel is difficult to use, especially if you are accustomed to using an iPod scroll wheel. Actually, I suspect that the scroll wheel is just a couple vertical and horizontal heat sensors packaged as a scroll wheel. If you can get over this small disadvantage, this product is great",0
4380,Outstanding card for picture transfers. I ordered this to easily transfer pictures between my cameras and my computers.  It helps save time when I want to access a picture or set of pictures to transfer and print on my system.  I can carry it with me and transfer all manner of pictures to other family computers.,0

Unfortunately though not much room for any other types of peripheral, ie notebook mouse, once my adaptor and power cord went in, as nothing else but my notebook fits in that compartment so they had to go in another, but all in all, really nice case, and not too heavy being leather either. Another good point ladies is that its looks are relatively unisex, not too masculine but not too feminine either. Highly recommended",0
4383,"Stylish bag for Dell 700m. I'm pretty picky, but this bag lived up to the various good reviews I read on Amazon.  As others have said, you cannot fit much in the bag other than the laptop itself.  In other words, bulky accessories will not fit.  However, you can fit your Dell 700m with the extended battery and an extra 4 cell battery as well (placed vertically next to the computer).  You can also fit on top of the computer a very small wireless mouse (e.g. I found a very small GE Wireless Mouse, which isn't the best product, but fits in the case---there are probably several other small mice that will fit).  In addition, there is an outside document pouch that you can fit some papers in--although a small stack of papers is all that will fit.  The bag is very attractive and professional and provides ample protection for your computer.  I would have given the product a 5, but the bag is experiencing a little bit of wear on the corners and I've only had it for a few months.",0

Fortunately this is a standard cable and I was able to replace it for under $5.00, locally",0

4387,"as good as advertised, wonderful picture quality on my TV. Apple TV performs exactly as promised, allowing the user to play iTunes media on a TV. Most people will use it for watching downloaded iTunes television programs or films. In my case I've been living overseas for the past nine years, so I've become very dependent on iTunes to keep up with programs such as 24, Lost, Heros, and Battlestar Galactica to name a few. While I was content to watch shows on my MacBook, I was longing to watch them on a normal TV. It was especially difficult when my wife and I scrunched together on the sofa to watch our favorite shows. We're probably among the minority who actually bought a new TV for our Apple TV (our old one was not compatible). The need for a more current TV is perhaps a consideration for some as they decide whether or not to purchase an Apple TV. The picture from the Apple TV is outstanding on our LCD television. While it's not HD, it's still very crisp and clean. As with almost all Apple products, Apple TV is extremely simple to set up and use. If you know how to Sync an iPod on iTunes, you should have no problem using Apple TV. Initial setup involves only a few very simple steps. My only issue is that Apple ought to have included larger hard drive. Other than this small issue I am extremely pleased with my Apple TV. I highly recommend it to people who watch a lot of things from iTunes on their computer and would like to see them on a television",0
4388,"Great idea!  Nice card. This is a high capacity card that can hold a ton of digi pix.  It's pretty fast when downloading info to my computer via the integrated USB device.  Not having to use an extra card reader is also a real plus.The main downside is that it seems a bit flimsy when opening it to the USB connector.  I have to be very careful not to snap the thing in half.  Other than just being gentle with it, it's been a great purchase",0
4389,"Very Happy!. I love eVO3. I love the fact that it not only protects the screen but it protects the wheel. The only thing that I do not like is the fact that I can not leave the cover on if I am using my dock with speakers. It won't go down far enough to make the connection with the cover on. So if you use a dock a lot this may not be a wise choice, but if you don't mind having to take it off then you'll be happy",0

It's slim and lightweight enough that I tend to drop it in my shirt pocket and forget about it.  You probably see where this is going...but yes, it's been run through the washing machine at least four times.  What may be even more impressive is that it's been run through the dryer three times (once I did catch it after being washed and saved it from the dryer, allowing it to air dry instead).  It still works as well as the day I took it out of the package, never missing a beat",0
4395,"Reliable!. I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home.To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 MB drives accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB drive at the bottom of the dryer; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable",0

I was a little hesitant buying this without trying it but I thought the other review, and the fact that this brand/model seems to be carried widely, was a good reference.I love it!.I wear no-line bi/tri focals and with normal monitor screen heights on my desktop I was always tilting my head backward in order to view the screen. This lead to a stiff neck a lot of times. (Yes, setting the monitor back a couple of feet would work too, but by then the print is so small one would need a larger monitor, and that becomes expensive quickly.)With this mount I have the bottom of my 19"" widescreen Viewsonic LCD monitor right on my desk in front of my keyboard. My neck feels better already! If on occasion I need the desk space the monitor swings up and out with only a couple of fingers worth of force.The mount comes with adjustments for lifting force and frictional (sideways) force. It also comes equipped with an optional screw-in desktop mount. In my case the clamp mount is perfectly adequate. In fact as I tighened the clamp I was impressed that I could not do any sliding of the mount sideways. It is a nice design.This is well worth the money.",0

I don't like that I don't have a clock display at all times and sometimes the CD changer is confusing to me, but it will just take time to figure it out.  Since these kind of bookshelf stereos are becoming more obsolete, I am happy to have this one.  With all the sound quality of the Sonys I have owned (I've gone through a half dozen) it will please me if this just hangs on and does not become a disappointment in functionality.  I would like this one to hang around longer.  Hopefully, the CD reader will not go out like my Sonys did",0
4409,"Shhhhhhhhhhhh.... Not only is this drive much faster than my old IDE drive with 8M cache, it is as quiet as can be.  In fact, if I didn't see my screen updating, I'd think the drive was dead it's so quiet!  It's almost night and day the difference in noise!!",0
4410,"works great, no analog though. It works!  The antenna isnt junk either, I am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk. I also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area (chicagoland). Problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable, so I cant watch those on my mac.  Its not supposed to be a cable tuning box, just digital stuff, so its fine, I just thought it did that as well.next thing to do is get a bigger/better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable (as I only watch a couple stations anyways).eyetv - works.cytv with it - works great!  make sure you go and donate to that opensource project",0
4411,Pleased so far. So far I have been very pleased with these batteries. My last digital camera had it's own battery and held a charge for a very long time. These batteries have met or surpassed my expectations,0
4412,"super bag, worth the price. The other reviews are accurate - this is a super bag.  I researched a lot of bags and settled on this one to replace my old Targus CityLine bag for my Dell M1210.  I would just add a couple of notes to what others have said:First, it's a little heavier in the hand than you might expect, though the handle design helps distribute the weight evenly. BUT once it's on your shoulder, the ergonomic contour design makes it hardly noticeable.Second, the shoulder strap is well padded and doesn't slip at all.  This can actually be a problem if you're wearing a heavy coat, however, as the strap can be a royal pain to remove - no matter what you do, it won't slip off your shoulder.  Instead, you have to sort of peel it off.  Takes a little getting used to, but this is a minor annoyance compared to the benefits of this case.Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the handy ticket/passport pocket really is convenient when you're traveling.  The front pockets are also very convenient.  It's a little unfortunate that there aren't any CD sleeves built into the bag, given that it already has more pockets than a levi's factory.Overall, a fantastic bag that looks good, and is great for travel.  Highly recommended",0
4413,"Great Product, Lousy Instructions. The instructions fail to mention that you have to change the settings on your iPod so that it sends the signal out to the tv or that the red and blue plugs should be plugged into the white and red (in that order) AV inputs on your TV",0
4414,Picture Perfect. I just purchased the Canon 20D and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities.  Plenty of picture room and I plan to purchase a 2GB prior to my trip to IRELAND.  Price wise I did great and the turnaround time was excellent.This card was ranked No 1# in two seperate on line test so I was very sold prior to my purchase.,0
4415,"Good Link. If you run short on cable when making a connection(s), you can connect another RCA cable(s) with these Female-to-Female connectors. They are color coded for Left and Right audio. I use them because I am constantly moving equipment around. I use them for audio but they can also be used for video if you are using RCA connectors. Monster Cable makes a high grade product. Highly recommended",0
4416,"Great Product. Super product!  This case is light, super solid, and convenient. I carry it with me wherever I go with my camera, so I always have extra cards on hand, and never have to worry about where to store a card",0
4417,"Another California Investigator. I made the investment in this recorder and have been very pleased.  I use the Olympus 2300 for witness and subject interviews in closed enviroments (interview rooms, offices, etc).  The sound quality is great.  The ability to add memory sold me.  I installed a 256 MB chip and on standard play I now have over 42 hours of recording time!  No more worry about fliping tapes.  And no more booking tapes.  My interviews could go all day and the logistics involved in standard tapes is not a consideration anymore.  I upload everything to my agency's server and skip the evidence room.  I like the folders option that allows for the division of recodings by file...A to E.  On road trips, each letter is a day.  Each interview is a number.  On my paper notes and just note A1, B3, E5 for quick reference.  After the recordings are uploaded to my server (or laptop) I then re-name the files to the names of the persons who were interviewed.  The larger screen is easy to see and the recording time counts down so I know how long the recoding has been going.  I can then make notes on paper with a reference to time into the recording allowing for quick play back later.  The only problem I had are batteries.  I carry extra AAA batteries and repalce them if the battery level falls below half.  I recently got 20 plus hours of record time on a set of two batteries...but always be ready to switch them out if things could go long.  Overall, great tool and easy to learn and use",0
4418,"connect your pc to your home theatre system in no time. i bought this cable to connect my laptop to my home theatre receiver, eliminating the need for computer speakers whcich could never match up to the sound of my home theatre system.  the 12 ft cable is plenty long enough and it is surprisingly high quaality for the price.  i don't give the cable 5 stars because i know there are higher quality cables out there with 24 karat gold connectors which will give you a cleaner sound.  don't buy the 12ft version unless you need the length because the longer the cable, the more signal loss there is.  this is perfect for the average guy who just wants to listen to his mp3's or play PC game audio through home theatre system",0
4419,Good purchase. The item works as I expected. I received within the tiem offered by the seller. I'll buy again from this merchant,0

4421,"Easy to use, lightweight. This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what ""hold"" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use",0
4422,"Works as advertised. Great with my Rebel XT. Hard to be verbose about a CF card...but it has performed without a hitch in my Rebel XT. Used a 1GB Ultra II when I bought the camera a year ago, picked up the 2GB card before a family vacation in August. Excellent product, no worries",0
4423,"Amazingly detailed. I purchased this software more for it's street mapping detail than for the topographic mapping. Living out here in rural KY I have yet to find a backroad or country highway that isn't accurately mapped in this software. Even the local B&B's, restaurants, and filling stations are in the POI (points of interest) database. Simply amazing. You can easily define waypoints and build routes. If you plan to do any kind of road navigation with your Magellan handheld GPS but also want the additional features of topographic mapping then this is the software to get.I will mention that version 1.0 appears to pre-date the eXplorist series because there is no built-in support for direct download to the eXplorist. It takes an extra step using the Magellan Conversion Manager software to load regions into your eXplorist. Not difficult at all.The 3D view option is somewhat useless, as it often does not depict the physical world closely enough to be meanigful. The ability to select regions for downloading to the GPS seems to be limited to rectangular selections only. This works well enough in most cases but for irregularly shaped terrain it causes you to select a lot more area than you really want, which consumes more GPS memory. Maybe this is a limitation of how mapping software works but having a freeform selection tool would be a nice addition.Be aware that converting regions for download takes a lot of computing power and memory! Converting an entire state like KY takes several minutes on my 3GHz computer and results in a 55Mb download file!Overall this product is well worth the price",0
4424,Cell Phone Morphs to Mp3 player. Got this card for my son's new mp3 enabled cell phone.  Works just like any flash drive player.  Now he doesn't need to carry multiple gadgets around.  Best price was here on Amazon and shipping was lightning fast.  Took about 2 seconds to install the card.  Thanks Amazon,0
4425,"Great Value. If you are looking for a cost effective replacement for your original white earbuds, this is it.  The different size rubber earpieces offer an excellent choice of giving you comfort over a long period.  I have slept with these earbuds and have not noticed them.  The sound is very pleasant and for the average person will be very acceptable.  Let us face it, most of us cannot hear the entire extreme high and low frequencies any way, so why pay more for something that cannot be used.  These earbuds are the way to go for comfortable, cost effective, pleasurable listening to your device.  Whether it be an MP3 player, radio of CD player, these earbuds will make your music a most enjoyable experience",0
4426,"Gets the job done. So here is my story:I had a Dell Dimension, and bought Neverwinter Nights 2.  My ATI Radeon 9550 had a lot of trouble running that game, so I ordered this card along with a power supply upgrade.  However, my Dell case wouldn't allow the power supply upgrade(go figures).  So I decided to finally build my own custom computer like I have been wanting to do.  To make a long story short, I had already ordered and opened this card, and didn't want to return it, so I pretty much built my system around this card.  The bad part of that, it's an AGP.  That is my only regret on my newly built system, no PCI Express or SLI.However, in relation to this card itself, my system is PRM800 Pro M7, 2 GB DDR2 533Mhz, PD 830 3.0Ghz, Zalman 9500 LED Ultra Quiet CPU fan, Ultra 550W x2 psu.  This card with this sytem, even though agp 8x, runs killer.  I can run Quake 4 and Doom 3 at ultra quality settings with full openGL settings enabled.  FEAR and FEAR Extraction point run at near highest setting (volumetric lighting set to medium) flawlessly.  And Neverwinter Nights 2 runs at near max perfect.  I also use a Samsung SyncMaster 17"" LCD with 200Mhz forced refresh rate.So if you're are wanting to play the newest games at max or near max, for at least another year or two, this is a great card and a good money saver.  But if you're building a system, spend the extra cash for PCI-Express, SLI compatable.  It will be worth your money in the long run.  I have a feeling AGP will be phased out soon",0
4427,"Very Happy. I have been using this TV for just about a month now and really enjoy it. Shipping took about 10 days with no problems. The tracking info is not always correct so don't get too worried. I was called on a Friday to have delivery scheduled for the following Tuesday (Between 1-5PM). The delivery driver called about 15 minutes before arriving to make sure I could still be there. Like others, the reason for the 4 stars is due to sound quality. However, 90% of the time I use different speakers so it is not an issue. I would also recommend adjusting the energy savings level as soon as you get the TV. I put mine on low (standard is High) and it makes a huge difference for brightness. The price dropped about $70 after I bought it but Amazon credited me the difference when I e-mailed them. I don't have cable, but am using standard rabbit ears to get a great digital signal. The Masters looked unbelievable in HD. I recommend Amazon to anyone looking to buy a TV based on my experience",0
4428,"Battery Problem Fixed!. I've been using this phone for about 2 years now...And have been fuming about the cheap nickel cadmium battery for about that amount of time as well!When I purchased it, this was Panasonic's top-of-the-line phone. So naturally, I just assumed that they had used a Nickel hydride battery -like my last Panasonic phone: the KX-TG2550S. I didn't even notice about the battery right away. But when I finally got around to opening up the back of the handset, I was *horrified* to see that NiCd label!Since the 'memory effect' of nickel cadmium batteries is well known, using one in something like a cordless phone is inexcusable! This is because it will be recharged frequently, is usually never fully discharged -and is unusable when it is. [OK, so you can still use the speakerphone in the base, Gah! Might as well just plug in a regular phone!] Those that haven't had battery issues are probably singing a different tune after a number of months when the NiCd battery's power output nosedives.And since I've had better battery performanace, there aint no going back!There can be no other reason for the decision to use such inferior technology, except to save a few bucks. Or more likely, since a Panasonic replacement battery costs $20-25, to cash in because they need to be replaced more often.[an absurd price because all the battery consists of -I took one apart- is 3 AA size batteries]Fortunately, Energizer now makes a Nickel hydride [NiMH] replacement battery for this phone, Search Amazon for Energizer ER-P511",0
4429,"A must have for burners of CDs and DVDs. I recently burned 25 DVDs, all of the same thing. Realizing that I didn't want to give people a DVD that said ""Office Depot"" on it, I decided on buying a bunch of labels and using them with the spindle I already have.The labels are high quality, as you would expect from Avery-Denison. Even though the package says they are for the CD Stomper, they can be adapted to work with any label maker. These labels are also excellent for use in a printer that is capable of printing on CDs",0
4430,"Awesome upgrade from my Muvo!  Who needs an iPod anyway?. I really love this MP3 player, it truly deserves a five star rating. I got this as an upgrade to my Creative Muvo TX FM MP3 player and immediately noticed a significant improvement in sound quality. I also noticed that I can now download songs directly from Rhapsody onto my U2; the U2 recognizes so many file formats that you can get your songs from just about anywhere. Another significant improvement is battery life, its seemed like the Muvo would perversely run out of battery power while I was out in the middle of a pasture far from a fresh battery. With the built in rechargeable battery of the U2 I have only ever run out of juice once. I love that I don't have to carry around yet another AC adaptor to charge this thing, just plug it in by USB to charge it!Those are all my favorite things. I was a bit disappointed at the lack of armband, I had become very fond of wearing my Muvo on its armband. However that was easy enough to rectify, I simply ordered an iAudio armband and am happy again.All in all, this was a very worthwhile upgrade from a Muvo and definitely worth the extra money too! I think the U2 will give the iPod's a run for the money, so small and light and rugged... I sure wouldn't want to wear one of those iPods while working with my tractor",0
4431,"Great Price and Service. The product was exactly like in retail stores, for about 60% of the price, what a deal! GREAT service, shipped within 24 hrs and arrived on time, in a professional looking package.I will use them again for my replacement blade needs",0
4432,"works flawlessly as a bridge. I bought two -- the second one after realizing that one will not work as a bridge. It plugs into the Linksys Cable Gateway in one room, and to a 5-port switch in the other room. Nothing more to say -- follow the instructions and it will work as advertised.",0

My only problem was with customer service which said the keyboard wasn't compatible with my PDA when in fact it was",0
4437,"Better range than others I've tried. I live in a heavily wooded, mountainous area. This radio is the fourth I've tried in two weeks. I returned the previous three sets because of their hopelessly poor range. Two Unidens were capable of a very marginal 1.25 miles, and another Cobra only about .75 miles. I wasn't expecting the max advertised range because of the terrain and trees obstructing line of sight. This new Cobra can reach 2.25 miles, and that's from inside the house to inside the truck at the other end. Another plus is the use of lithium batteries. The weather radio feature and the vibrating alert are two more handy features. The only negative comment I have is the thick case, 1.5 inches including the belt clip. I think I'll keep this set",0
4438,"CD wallet. Good quality.  Well made.  Good value.  Saved me a lot of space, with room to expand",0
4439,"Great Case!. I recently got this case from amazon.com, and when it shipped to my door, I couldn't wait to open the box. I thought, ""I finally got a case for my new ipod nano!"" I opened the box, and took the case out to put it on my nano. It fitted just right! It wasn't too snugly or too loose, it was perfect. The only bad thing about this case is that you can't charge the nano while its in the case, but you could always take it out and charge it with care. I'm so glad they made this case!",0
4440,"Smokin!. This is definitely a USB 2.0 HIGH SPEED reader.  I got 17.1 MB/s and the package up ""up to 18 MB/s"".  I was using a Sandisk Extreme III 2GB Compact Flash card.  That means you can move 1 GB of data in about 60s.  The speed difference between this reader and my USB 2.0 full speed reader is like night and day.A word of caution:  USB 2.0 is not necessarily faster that USB 1.x.  What you want is USB 2.0 ""High Speed"", with the high speed being 480 Mbit/s data rate.  A device can be USB 2.0 compliant and not be high speed, which is typically the old 12 Mbit/s rate.  Many people get confused on this point and think USB 2.0 means the device is faster, but this is not necessarily the case.Rest assured, this Sandisk Extreme Reader is a USB 2.0 high-speed device.  If take a lot of pictures and fill up card above the 1 GB level, this beauty will save you lots of time.  I am totally satisfied and would highly reccommend this card reader to friends",0
4441,"G4000A by Grundig/Eton: More than I expected!. I needed a new clock radio, but I hate the tinny sound produced by most offerings. Why not, I thought, invest a bit more money and get a radio/clock? Something I could run on AC but could take with me and use battery power. AM/FM with a backlight and an alarm and sleep function would be perfect, I thought, and I came close to buying a Degen, even thought about the more expensive Sony.This G4000A is sleek, just big enough to make it's presence known on my bedside table, but small enough to leave room for the lamp. The build quality is just fine-light enough to make it truly portable, yet just heavy enough to balance the antenna if laid down using the back support. The case is awesome, a throwback to the days of real leather cases (this one is vinyl) and compliments the set. Controls are easy to use, and dang! This set is not hard to setup or change things like memory stations, time etc. Shortwave is fine for my purposes, and the tuning steps are selectable in digital and there is a dial for fine tuning.AM/FM reception is great, but the tone button effects little change. This is a great radio for the house, to take on vacation, anywhere. It is my new 'radio/clock' and for the price I paid ($99.00 Cdn) I couldn't have asked for more. All needed accessories are included. Buy a better antenna if you need one.I love it",0
4442,"If you use a laptop but like a real keyboard & mouse check this out!. Since I travel a fair amount I need a laptop for the portability. But when I'm at my home location I love being able to slide my laptop into my Kensington Laptop Desktop and use a real keyboard and mouse - I can type and click much faster. Since your laptop rests at an angle, the laptop screen is elevated to a much more comfortable reading level.  It also allows for a good airflow to dissipate heat from the laptop; something I always had problems with when the laptop was resting on the desktop since I would normally have documents and a notepad laying next to the letter. The black trim with the Kensington logo is actually a clip for holding papers - this was another nice, handy feature.I checked out as many other laptop desktops or stands as possible before buying this Kensington model. For under $40 this was hard to beat. Most were either brand specific docks and were much more costly, or they just elevated the laptop slightly and didn't allow you to rotate the laptop up to a 45 degree angle (this really helps raise the screen and get it closer; which helps when you have a full size keyboard in front of it). I love this accessory and you can't beat the price!",0
4443,"It's as easy as plug and play. We currently have the Linksys BEFSR41 4-port router/switch for our home network.  It's been working great for about 4 years now, but we've now run out of ports.  I did some research on the 8 port router/switch product from Linksys, but the reviews were mixed.  The reviews were mixed for similar competing products also.  So I took the route of getting the EZXS55W to expand our existing home network.  I just plugged it into the network and it just worked out of the box.  No configuration needed.  It's also very tiny.  I highly recommend the product",0

4452,"The hardest part about the install was finding an outlet!. My wife and I have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via WiFi spread throughout our four-bedroom home. Among these were an Avaya 4610SW SIP (VOIP) phone and a PC serving as an Asterisk server (Asterisk is an open source PBX). This configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. In the past few months I've been having occasional disconnects of VOIP calls coming in to Asterisk from the PSTN. After some investigation, I decided to move my phone and server off WiFi and onto a HomePlug network, using the electrical wiring as another Ethernet. The hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is, in the basement where the server is, and in the family room on the first floor where the LinkSys WiFi router/access point is located. After that, it was just a matter of plugging in an Ethernet cable from the Netgear box to the router, and moving the Ethernet cables from the WiFi boxes for the phone and server to the Netgear boxes. It was that simple.[...]I wish all high-tech equipment were this easy to install",0

4454,"Hands down.... The best mp3 player I have ever had.  It is much smaller than the picture makes it out to be.  Fits in your pocket easily and the sound is amazing.  I was able to charge the device, put over 50 songs in it and play it about 30 minutes right out of the box.  It's so easy and simple to use, highly recommended.  It also has a lot of additional features.",0
4455,"Excellent little unit. I've been using this player for nearly and month now and truly LOVE this unit. It's physically very small (in many ways it's smaller than the iPod Nano!) and the sound quality is quite good even with the headphones Creative provides with the unit. The inclusion of a built-in display is very useful, especially when you configure the internal features of the unit. Because it is a device that works under Microsoft's ""Play for Sure"" specifications, you can also play back DRM-protected .WMA files downloaded from many commercial music web sites such as the ones offered by Wal-Mart and Yahoo! Music.I would recommend a couple of things though--consider getting rechargeable AAA batteries since the unit does use up AAA batteries fairly quickly and also for maximum sound quality, get a good ""in ear"" earbud headphone such as the Panasonic RP-HJE50 available on Amazon",0
4456,"Excellent peace of mind. I started looking at network storage products after one of our PC's lost a hard drive that had some of our old scanned film images that I'd never copied over to our newest PC.  The best thing about the Media Vault is it was very easy to setup all my PCs to automatically backup my photos continously.  We'll never lose another picture (which has also gotten me out of the dog house with my wife).I'm also using it to store all of our music which helps with some of our kids PCs that have limited hard drive capacity.Overall, a great product and very simple to setup and use",0
4457,"good product. works well, easy to use and I use it daily, mostly in my truck.  The software was easy to understand.  I had trouble with the first one I bought in less than 30 days.

4458,"Close to perfect, but not quite... Great styling, sound, and features really make this a standout product.  The Bose Wave radio is a thing of beauty and will enhance any room decor, while the sound quality is outstanding.  It has nice features, with the auto dimming LED display and the gradual volume increase on the alarm particulary well thought out.I have one gripe - all the time setting features are set by remote control, which in theory is cool, but in practise is a pain in the neck.  On most clock radios, to get the digits turning quickly when setting the clock / alarm time, you hold the button down - same with the Bose remote, except that the infrared link isnt perfect, so instead of being able to advance the time quickly, the time advances slowly (painfully so) because the button never stays 'held down' long enough.  It took me about 20 mins to advance to the desired time - doesnt sound too inconvenient, but when you've just shelled out over $300 for a clock radio, it's a bit frustrating.Still highly recommend product - only loses a star because of time setting shortcoming.",0
4459,"TIVO gave me a life!!. Not going to beat a dead horse...there's plenty of reviews on this product.  However, I love this product.  I would recommend this to anyone that hates spending time watching commercials, hates flipping through channels constantly looking for things to watch, and likes actually being able to no-kidding own whats on the box and not have to lose all your recordings just because you change cable service providers.",0

4461,"This is a great deal. I don't quite understand all the negative reviews.  It is a little tricky at first to figure out, I think.  There seem to be a few holes in the instruction manual, and things should have probably been explained better.  I don't know why that is the case, but it seems to be.  Also, you really do need to look at the online instructions as well.  You cannot just go by what is in the paper instructions that come with it.However, just a little monkeying around with it and you should be able to figure it out easily.  It has worked just fine for me, and was so cheap.  I bought two more, one for my brother and one for my dad, and they both love them.  Mine has frozen up twice, with a lot of use.  Upon resetting, one time the music was lost.  So, keep everything backed up on yr computer.  But, honestly, with just a small amount of patience you should really not have much problem with this thing.  And, it is so cheap, the small added effort should easily be worth it for most people.  If you are among the economic elite and also don't like to spend any time with small technical challenges, I would recommend putting out more cash for something a little easier, maybe.  For the rest of us, I think it is very hard to beat this deal",0
4462,"Excellent product. I have two of these guys, one for backups, the other my ""briefcase"" (going back and forth between work and home every day). Not a single problem, plug and go (I am using the FireWire interface), and silent. My boss got one on my recommendation, after ditching another brand, and loves it too",0
4463,"Excellent Printer!. This HP all in one printer/copy/scanner is just great.  I've had mine for about a month now and I haven't had a single problem thusfar.As far as printing, the printer is much like previous models of HP laser printers.  The prints come out flawless and are crisp and dark.  Speed was very important in buying a laser printer and this one lives up to my expectations.The copy/scanning property of this AIO printer is easy to use and very powerful.  While I can't copy color photos (b&w laser printer), the scanning of any image, color or not, comes out pretty well on the computer.  It is easy to tell the AIO printer to scan an image from the computer and the picture is conveniently saved as a jpeg at a location of my choosing.  No fuss or hassles.I'm currently a college student and copying class notes or study guides has never been easier.  I just put the stack of papers into the copying tray, tell the printer to copy them, and it's done...quickly.  Long gone are the days when I had to run to the library or copy store and find change to get copies.  This thing does it all.The ONLY reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the printer's size.  It is big.  I imagine it is quite difficult to pack a printer/copier/scanner all into one printer and maintain a small size, but I think HP may have been able to do it.  This printer does take up a large amount of desk space compared to other printers I've seen.  However, it still beats having a separate printer and scanner, so I won't complain too much",0
4464,"A pretty solid multifuction device at a good price. With the HP Photosmart C5180 printer, Hewlett Packard has brought to market a very good multifunction device at a great price point. Although it doesn't seem to be part of the current HP product line any longer, it is still a great multifunction device that deserves your consideration if you are in the market for a new printer or multifunction device.You get a lot of features packed into one unit. Along with the printer and scanner, there is also a set of memory card slots that will accept the most popular types of digital camera memory. The control panel features one touch access to many functions, including the copier functionality. A small color LCD lets you adjust printer settings, make copies, configure the onboard network interface and perform basic photo editing and printing functions. Unlike any other printer I've seen before, HP includes some document ""templates"" in the printer's memory. These templates let you make graph paper and ruled sheets of notebook paper. Finally, there is the included Ethernet interface, which lets you connect the Photosmart C5180 to a network and use it with multiple computers.Out of the box setup was easy. Removing the packaging tape and inserting the ink cartridges for the first time is a very straightforward process. The inks click easily and positively into place.When you've completed the basic setup and turned the unit on, you're ready to start installing the software and connecting the unit to your computer. HP provides two options for connectivity--you can use either USB or plug the device into an Ethernet network. I used the network connection. HP's software found the device immediately and configured it with no intervention on my part.The included software bundle is available for PC and Macintosh computers. As an added bonus, the Macintosh version of the software is a universal binary--that is, it runs on both PowerPC and Intel Macintosh computers. HP's software selection is pretty well rounded. You get everything you need to organize and print photos, make scans and adjust the printer settings. I found the software easy to install and was able to use it well within twenty minutes of completing the installation.If you use the network connection, the Photosmart C5180 has a basic management web page that can be used to quickly check ink levels and even perform an immediate scan that will show up as an image in your web browser.Ink life is excellent and print quality is very good. Photographs printed on this printer using the special HP photo paper look just like professional prints and hold up well to being handled. Text documents are not quite as crisp as those coming from a laser printer, but they still look very sharp and clear. After printing several photos and over 200 pages of black text documents, the only cartridge that showed any drop in capacity is the black one. All the others still show as being completely full.Unlike many printers, you won't break the bank on consumables. You can buy all six ink tanks and a 150-pack of small photo paper for about $36 USD. Ink can also be purchased by the color, at about $8 USD per color or $12 USD for the black ink. This helps offset the purchase price of this printer.Unfortunately, there are some things that are not so great about the unit.  For starters, the PC version of the software takes a long time to install.  While the stability of the Intel version of the Macintosh software was nearly perfect, the PowerPC version didn't do nearly so well. I saw a lot of unexpected crashes or applications that disappeared outright, especially when managing photos on my PowerPC G4 Mac mini.Some people have reported that the unit's scanner is not very good. The scanner does have an unfortunate tendency to produce ""noisy"" scans, especially with items that have a lot of dark colors. Photocopies made using the ""black"" copy button have a greenish cast to them. I was able to solve this problem by using the ""color"" button to copy black and white documents instead.The printer also moves very swiftly. This isn't a problem as much as it is a notice of caution. You should place the unit only on a very sturdy table or desk, as it moves quickly enough in some printing modes that it could possibly fall off or break what you've placed it on.HP Technical Support could be a lot better. The first one of these units that I purchased was stuck in ""manufacturing mode"" and would not act normally. The representative that I spoke to was hard to understand, didn't seem to understand my problem and couldn't offer any advice to solve the problem other than returning the printer to HP for replacement. I returned it directly to the vendor instead. The replacement worked perfectly in every respect.This unit uses print heads that are separate from the ink tanks. While ink is easily replenished, I saw no way of replacing the installed print heads. They look to be permanently installed, which suggests that if they ever fail or become clogged, you may be buying a new printer. Considering that HP builds printers that usually last a very long time, this comes across to me as a surprising decision on their part. Only time will tell for sure.Finally, there are some features I would have liked to see in this unit. Topping the list would be a duplex printing module. Some of the higher Photosmart models can have this feature added. It seems like HP planned to offer this for the C5180 as well. The internal web page has a ""duplexer installed"" field, and the back door can be completely removed. Second to that would be the inclusion of a document feeder. Having network scanning functionality is very handy, but it gets a little tedious to get up, walk across the room and change the document on the scanner bed. Again, higher end models in the Photosmart lineup do include this feature.All things considered, I find the HP Photosmart C5180 to be an overall good product. It has some areas where it needs improvement, but what product doesn't? I don't think you can go wrong with this product, as much of what it does is done very well",0

4479,"Very fast ... not sure of its reliability. When I bought my camera, the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package.  It was very quick--far faster than any of the 512MB cards I had on hand, even those that were of the previous generation of ""professional"" Lexar cards.  My camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card, to the point that I can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly.My only complaint is in the card's reliability.  After about a month of medium-load use (about 1000 photos taken), the card ceased functioning while within the camera.  Neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers (including the PC Card slot on my laptop with a CF adapter).  The image ""rescue"" software provided by Lexar on the card was of no use, either.Lexar replaced the card, which has worked fine ever since.  However, I purchased a second one, which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken.  Again, the included ImageRescue software failed to help--it found errors but could not do anything about them--but a commercial image recovery tool I purchased was able to read, then reformat, the card, and it has worked reliably since",0

A note of caution--while the description refers to routing the charging cable, this unit does not charge your iPod.  All it does about charging is to let you put your separate charging cord from your separate charger through a hole in this unit--don't be mislead by the mention of ""holds your iPod cables for charging"" that it has anything to do with actually charging your iPod.

4518,"Great TV, Service & Delivery. I have had my Samsung for about three weeks now; no problems.  I am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs.  We also bought the 42"" plasma for my parents; we've been extremely happy with it as well.  In addition to the television, I am extrmemly happy with Amazon and the delivery process.  Everythin was handled very professionally.  The tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged.  I will buy next tv through Amazon as well",0

4521,"exactly what i needed. great for anyone with an extra drive kicking around, also alot cheaper than pre-assembled drives (even including buying a new one).  the only thing to keep in mind is that you NEED to have the drive's jumpers in master mode, as the enclosure isn't capable of cable-select",0
4522,"Perfect Companion to Sandisk Sansa. Perfect companion to my E280 8Gbyte Sandisk Sansa. Connecting to the USB on my HP laptop is not only a pain at times, it's not always convenient. Because I use the E280 both at home and on my sailboat while rolling over the waves of Lake Michigan, I need charging that's close by without having to turn on my laptop. It also works with my Xantex 400W portable power pack so I can charge while I'm ""moored"" in some cozy little cove enjoying the summer breezes and listening to either my downloaded tunes or directly to my favorite FM station. It's too bad Sandisk doesn't offer one as an option when you buy their product, however",0
4523,"Excelent delivery and value. I received my package within three days via the Super Saver Shipping (cost me nothing). The printer is great, too. I used the Brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to HP and I'm impressed. The printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up, and its very light weight and small size making it more portable. I love it",0
4524,Great stand!. This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs.  It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders.  The page holders are easy to put back in.  It saves space on your desk.  I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks.  It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find,0
4525,"Excellent & Usable SMB Product. This once available product has served me well.Very dynamic, universal in use, and user friendly.

4526,"No problems with this. Bought this item over a year ago and have had no problems with this card.  It holds lots of pictures (depending on your settings) and hasn't caused me any problems.  Well worth the money!  I take lots of pictures of my son and anytime we go anywhere new, so it gets used a lot",0
4527,"Better price here than elsewhere... Bought the Hitachi DVD Camcorder--one of the first ones out, and it uses DVD-RAM for rewreitable media.  Who Cares?  I thought...  Except when it comes to buying media, and everyone else is using DVD-RW, so my media costs 5x as much!!!  Aargh!  Oh well, if you have to have it, then you have to have it.  And this is the one to get if you have a Mini DVD Camcorder that uses DVD-RAM.  It is double sided, for a full hour of video, and seems to record well",0

All programs run much faster, especially my h/s internet connection.  Have upgraded other computers with Kingston memory and have always ben impressed.  As a bonus, Amazon had the best price on this memory",0
4531,Very pleased with the unit. I couldn't find many reviews on this when I ordered it so I was hesitant.  I'm very happy with the performance of the unit.  It sounded great even when turned up much louder than I would expect to use it.  I'm getting fine reception with the antenna 15 feet from a window,0
4532,"Hot little big sound. This little unit is big in sound and features. I love the remote and the digital readout. I have heard better small speakers, but for the features this unit has a lot. Not quite the bass I expected but acceptable. A querky interface is about the only complaint I have. For the price this unit has the features and the volume to keep things thumping",0
4533,great product. set system up and was able to get great CD's from some of our old records and then using aux. was able to go from tapes to CD with excellent results. The only draw back is the speaker system,0
4534,"Excellent beginners tablet. I was considering purchasing a tablet and Wacom was consistantly recommended.  I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line).  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.  Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).  The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard).  Other than that, its an amazing product",0

4536,"using armbard at gym. I use the armband at the gym primarily, both cardio and weights.  It loses a star because the headphone wire comes out at a very conspicuous angle, sometimes getting stuck on the machine I'm using at the gym.  99% of the time I don't even notice that I'm wearing it, which is the idea.  It is very easy to adjust and put on/take off.  Custom designed for iRiver, the casing is excellent",0
4537,"Perfect!. I love these cases.  I bought one set to try out thinpaking my DVDs, and then ordered 4 more to do the rest. I currently own 157 DVDs, and so far I've moved 97 over to these cases (the rest are mostly box sets or already thinpaked).  Its very easy to adjust the covers to fit these thinner cases, just trim about 1-2 mms from the two sides, then slide it in.  I recommend using a straight edge blade with a ruler or other straight guide to get the best results.  Every new DVD I get will immediately get moved to these cases in the future.  My entertainment center is no longer double stacked and looks much neater",0

4540,Great for hiking. This GPS has gotten me out of the woods more than once in the dark.  By setting waypoints on the unit 4 of us were able to get back down off North Dome in Yosemite in the dark and find our way back to the car.  For the price this unit does plenty to get you out of trouble and as an avid photographer i use it on every trip.  Like the old American Express add never leave home without it,0
4541,It does what I hoped it would in a portable unit. I bought this unit for my son as a Christmas present.  We live in western NY and our weather is especially unpredictable because of Lake Ontario.  My son landscapes in the spring and summer and plows snow in the winter and he depends a great deal on the weather.  This unit allows him to take it with him and check the forcast whenever and wherever he needs to.  It seems very easy to program and use,0
4542,"Great product. This shredder although a bit more expensive than others is worth every penny. Shreds great,looks stylish. Highly recommended",0

4544,"Sony SU-RS11X Stand is great for Sony 60. I love the stand, looks like steel but more of a combination of nicely done press-wood which was covered with a great looking aluminium product. It was easy to assemble and setup. It has a security strap to hold the set on. The only minus is that the upper shelf has limited headroom. It was fine for my TIVO/DVD units but had to more my larger Sony Receiver to bottom shelf for it to fit. Not as easy to read or adjust at that level",0
4545,"A SOLID SYSTEM. Hands down, this is the best budget stereo system for the price. Period.",0
4546,"Very good deal for a reliable product. I bought this card to be used with an IPAQ HW6945 it has enough capacity for GPS maps, programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from Sandisk that is supported by the IPAQ. The reading / writing speed is ok too. Very good product for only 18 bucks",0
4547,"Pleased as Punch. After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on.I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending.I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port.What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market.A Satisfied Custome",0
4548,"Words Great and Looks Great. I needed something to put my 26"" LCD TV on and something that would fit the cable box underneath,to save room on the dresser in a bedroom. The television fits great, and the digital cable box fits underneath keeping it neat and using less space. It was a shot in the dark because the measurements were not clear. Note, my other cable box that has DVR is larger and would not have fit under the platform. The cable guy thought it was an awesome idea and said he'd recommend it to other customers. It's pretty sturdy and has a nice clean modern look. I don't think I'd put anything bigger than a 26"" on it though.",0
4549,"Excellent. I bought my son the Creative Zen Micro Photo and he LOVES it, he got it as a graduation gift. I bought this one in pink for myself, get it, you will love it. I did however purchase a better set of creative ear phones as the ones I upgraded to are more durable and have a better sound quality. You wont be dissapointed with your Zen Micro",0
4550,A Great Storage Device. I really like the Fellows Nylon CD Album (320-Disc Capacity). I have cleared out an area in my dresser that was filled with all my music cds and dvd movies. The album is also at a convenientt location next to the stereo system and it is also mobile. I can take in the car on a long trip or to the park on a picnic. It is very convenient and so mobile,0
4551,Good SATA Drive Enclosure. One of the few of these type of items available on the market. I bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. I had received some free drives from Newegg (Seagate) and needed to house them. This was a no brainer set up. The utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (XP pro SP2). The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the RAID 1 option and ext3 format. I like the fact that you can specify RAID size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen RAID and ext3. The only thing I can never get to work and it is 100% MY lack of knowledge is the email alerts. I couldn't get Infrant to do it and same with this one.As an aside I love Amazon and NewEgg. Great retailers both of them,0
4552,"Nice memory ,but is very litle. This memory is litle than I thougt , but very secure and very cute",0
4553,Great Protection. This clear case gives you good protection without adding much weight or bulk.  Its very hard to tell that the ipod is even in the case unless you are holding it your hand.  One disadvantge is that the case makes it diffcult to turn the ipod on and off.  Besides that all the other buttons are easy to use.  I would recomend this case to anyone who wants to protect their ipod from scratches a dings,0
4554,"Sturdy, reliable media. I've run through about 30 Ridata dual-layer DVDs thus far almost without untoward incident (the one exception being due, I suspect, to an operator error). I make no extravagant claims about the breadth of my sample, but the observed price:performance ratio has left me favorably impressed to date",0
4555,"Low price, good product. The machine was well priced for what you get.  It's easy to setup and has a resonable memory capacity.  The message play back sound quality could be better but for the price you can't complain",0
4556,"Well made, but pricey. If you don't care about price, this antenna is probably one of the best out there. Rugged, with grounding points, and weatherproof. It reeks quality. Even units which show up on ebay command close to new prices.I have 3 of them connecting three buildings about 200' apart. I used to lose signal when the rain hit. No longer. Perfect connections even in very bad weather. I've used them with ME103 and WG302 units.You will need special antenna wire to connect from the antenna to the WAPs. Netgear sells pricey wire designed for low signal loss as well. Keep it short. If you mount on a wall, make sure the antenna stands off a bit from any structure (6""+) for best signal, otherwise the wall may cause signal loss and interference.I bought all the pieces and the overall system works very well. I don't regret buying them one bit",0
4557,"Totally fun product, next versions will be even more awesome. Being able to access digital media from my tv and hifi system by remote, from the couch is awesome.The product works as specified, right out of the box.A few gripes:- Cables not included and cost me $70 extra- Capacity of &lt;40G is way too small for anyone with a large collection and leads to paring down choices (defeating premise of the product)- The software is stable but obviously rev1 since-- wont stream music to tv but will stream videos-- doesn't allow browsing of iStore-- content is limited to istore and not more generally e.g. youtube google videos-- initial download of several gigs takes hours/days on my wifi network-- Need HDMI and Widescreen but what early adopter doesn't have those?The limitations appear to be commerical rather than technical in nature.  I'd suspect the labs have a full-on version in prototype.  Some hacker probably has Red Hat Enterprise Linux running on it even now.Thankfully all the tech nonsense is hidden.  The hardest part was just setting up wifi id and passwords, which took all of 5 minutes.Devices like this have been available to the technically savvy for many years but rather like the ipod itself this is the first consumer-ready one.Microsoft and Oracle both had famous false starts with set-top boxes, Apple is beating the larger dinosaurs at their own game, although its closed business practices and products come straight from the big lizards playbook, they're much more nimble and stylish",0
4558,"Great deal for the money!. I've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull.  First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple, huh?  Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%.  I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it",0
4559,"Almost as good as the original. I'll admit, I lost my original stylus while moving my home, so I had to buy a replacement.Pro: This new stylus works just as well, with the added bonus of having a built in ink-pen - that's fantastic.Con: The only negative (and it's only a slight negative), is that the telescoping top doesn't work quite as well as the original. Don't get me wrong, it does telescope and feels great when in the 'long position'. But while in the 'holder', sometimes it doesn't pop-out on the first push. It's more of a slight annoyance than a problem",0
4560,"Speaker Mount. The ceiling speaker mount was easy to install.  I mounted a 12 pound speaker on the mount, which was designed to support up to 20 pounds.  It held the speaker securely into position",0
4561,Like it but it's not perfect. If you use it in the same general area and aren't overcrowded with radio stations it should work fairly well.  It's very simple to use and when you find a signal that isn't being used by another radio station it works great.  I travel to different areas quite a bit and have to find another station pretty frequently.  This can be difficult while driving unless one of your presets works.  When you pass under high voltage lines you get a lot of static and if another station starts to come in the tunefm will be overridden.I like that you can use it with or without the charger even though when using without the charger the battery is drained much quicker.  Overall I would recomend with these few caveats,0
4562,"Great sound, great features, great price. The sound quality in this little alarm clock radio is great. I listened to it in The Apple Store and decided I needed one of my own. The gentle wake feature is a nice touch. The AM radio antennae is a little on the clumsy side in terms of its size and the way you have to attach it to the radio, but NPR comes in crisp and clear so I'm not actually complaining.Another selling point for me was the overall usability of this product. The buttons are nicely positioned and the interface was pretty intuitive.",0
4563,Great But I Lost It!. I liked it but after attempting to use the little key chain thing it broke and fell off and I lost it.,0
4564,"Excellent product. I got the Soundsticks to use as a home stereo in a small room. I wasn't expecting superb sound quality and the Soundsticks really suprised me with the full and detailed sound they produce. Overall, the product is great value for money and the space it takes up. My only gripe is that there is no off button on them, so the only way to power off is to unplug them. I'm not sure how much power they use when idle, but not being able to power off is definitely a down side if you're energy conscious.",0
4565,"Device and software OK, GuitarPort Online is fantastic. This is an excellent practice/learning device.I was pretty dissapointed with the quality of the tone and emulations, but that's not what GuitarPort was meant for.  Also, the software for it is not all that great either.But none of that really matters.  What makes this shine is the (optional) ""GuitarPort Online"" service.  It has a huge collection of tabs, along with good quality recordings of the songs without the guitar part(s).GuitarPort Online is a brilliant idea well implemented.",0
4566,"Performs Better Than Advertised. I was skeptical of the claims stated for this product.  I have been fooled by marketing people before.  But this does what is advertised.  I was very pleased with the ease of set-up and show everyone who stops by the house what a joy it is to not have four different remotes...this replaced my TIVO, TV, DVD-VCR, and Stereo remotes",0
4567,"bose is steady. Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listenerswith no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is "" Those speakers sound so Good"" "" I love those cool little speakers"" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new.",0
4568,"gps  antenna. This item definity improves the reception of your gps unit, I now have a minimum of 7 to 9 satelites guiding me when we are taking a trip.....",0
4569,Perfect product for me. Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie,0
4570,"By Far the Best Antenna I've ever used. I was quite amazed at the reception this little antenna provides.  I can pick up so many more channels than I've ever been able to pick up before.  It was very simple to hook up, and doesn't look nearly as hideous as most other sets of &quot;rabbit ears&quot; that are out there.  For the price, you just can't beat this one",0
4571,"Perfect. I have the bigger 20g iPod because I wanted to have hours of music at my disposal when I go on my training runs (5k, 10k, half-marathon) and when I run races.  I'm willing to give up some to size to get this.  If I only needed an hour or half-hour, I'd have gone with a Nano.But the next problem is finding a sports band that won't let the iPod flop around, as they have a tend to shut off and have to be reset if they bounce around too much.  This armband is perfect for that.  It's comfortable neoprene, encases the iPod tightly, and secures it to your arm without letting it bounce at all.For men, this probably is just fine.  For women, it's probably a bad thing (depending).  But most runners don't care so long as they don't have to fight with their music",0
4572,"Sleek and Practical. I ordered this from Amazon after checking it out in a store and on the Salamander website.  Has great features - finally a system that lets you deal with all the cables for your media!  Also, mesh doors look nice and keep the air flowing. BE PREPARED to assemble this baby, though.  Luckily, I had a friend with patience who actually read the instructions!",0
4573,"it works. the drive works well, seems to copy items pretty quickly with firewire connection.  the orange rubber cover looks cooler than it is - sort of flimsy & removeable.  all lacie drives i have had have worked fine.  a bit overpriced perhaps, but reliability may be worth the price",0
4574,GREAT PRODUCT. Brother DK-1207 CD/DVD Label Roll works perfectly as expected.  I joined Amazon Prime & the shipping time was amazing,0
4575,"Best compact but roomy rolling laptop bag you can buy. I have looked at many - Delsey, Tumi, Targus, Samsonite, Swiss Army, you name it.This one has it all:-Ultra lightweight.-All the right pockets, well thought out design for different storage places, easy access to the things you need to get to quickly.-Room in the back, which I have not seen any other maker take advantage of - perfect for power supply and other bulky things there.-Room for the laptop, a writing pad, papers, and even a change of blouse and undies for an overnight trip!-One carrying handle - most others have 2 - one on either side, which makes picking the bag up quickly a bit of a fumble, unless you have them velcroed together, which then limits access to the insides!-A nice touch - a hook on the telescoping handle to hang your bagged lunch you had to buy at the airport to carryon with you - or your purse.-Will easily fit under an airline seat.-Only 1 minor negative - a great idea, but poorly executed...the shoulder strap is designed to be a quick attach/detach mechanism, but in reality, it is hard to engage, and next to impossible to detach.  Which means that if you need to quickly get rid of that strap, all you will do is open one of the zippers slightly and stuff it in, leaving it attached on the outside.  This is very minor, and the only reason I mentioned it is that they went out of their way to design this neat thing, but it just doesn't work.As a very frequent traveler, female, under 120lbs, this gives me plenty of room at a light weight, small size, highly configurable, and I can grab my boarding pass and earphones in a flash.Well done Kensington!  For the first time in a while, I can't wait to run to the airport",0
4576,"I love it. I'm coming to Amazon to buy one for my wife too.  Both of our cars have got AUX jacks, allowing us to listen to the iPod, and with this great remote control, we can pause or fast-forward/reverse without having to actually hunt for the iPod while we're driving.  I highly recommend it",0
4577,"Ease of use and reliability. I purchased this product for my work in order to curb the necessity of installing our Canon's software onto all computers.  This product does everything you'd expect it to do quickly and easily.  Many of the staff at my work are not the most technologically savvy, so a product as easy to use as this one is desirable.  You just stick the memory card in, plug it into the the usb port and it works just the same as any other flash drive",0
4578,fine little antenna. Radio Shack wanted $39.95 for a similar item so at $9.95 this was a steal - swr is good and performance is as much as I need for Corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what I need.  I did have to put a metal plate on the Vette (discreetly) as it wouldn't stick to the fiberglass.  Good produc,0
4579,"Excellent Product!. This LifeCam has the best quality for the money.  You can't go wrong.  Vivid and detailed images and easy, easy set-up and installation.  Works great with Vista",0
4580,"Great Protection... This case is a little pricey...but so is the MacBook. And so if you want great protection for your pricey buy, go ahead and purchase this case. I have no complaints, it snapped on easy as pie. I haven't tried to take it off yet...but there's no need except for cleaning. I've only had it a week but I'm impressed. It doesn't cause over heating and doesn't get in the way. Definitely doesn't take away from the attractive look of the MacBook. Would go well with the white or black style. Great protection, great buy",0
4581,"Things to consider if you're getting a 2GB card. I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.",0
4582,"Don't buy a new CD player. Over the course of the last few months my CD player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a CD at all. 5 minutes after my package arrived with this CD cleaner in it and I was playing CDs again.

I am going to use this 96 CD Wallets in my car to carry my music on the road.I don't see any problem about the rebate.  Some buyer already clarified the rebate issue with the manufacturers and posted on the Velocity 320 CD wallets product page.  Check it out.,0
4584,"Works as expected, with extras. Quick Background:I have been using the Pharos GPS kit for the Dell Axim x3i.  When I upgraded to an Axim x50v I wanted to continue using the GPS software, and Pharos offered this adapter that would work since the x50v has a compact flash slot.Pros:-Does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Allowed me to use the kit I already owned.-Allows the GPS to work without being plugged into power.  I am no longer tied to the car - I can walk/bike/whatever around with my GPS.-Includes an extension cable so I can stick the receiver on the windshield.Cons:-Not much room for improvement with an adapter, but do wish it were a little less expensive.  I don't think adapters in general should cost more than $25",0
4585,I Love this product. This is a great armband.  I have been using it for several months and have had not issues with it.  It stays on when I run and I never worry about losing my iPod.  The only issue I have is that there could be more velcro on the strap.  The strap is big enough for a larger piece of velcro but for some reason they choose not to fill it up.  Otherwise...a really great product,0
4586,"Excellent card. This card is lightning fast. I am using it with my Canon SD700 and works great. Only drawback is that it is slightly expensive, but quality never comes cheap. :",0
4587,"The mouse is fine. The buying experience, not so much. I needed three of these mice. For reasons that are STILL unknown, Amazon forced me to purchase one mouse three times; I could not order three mice in a single order. I have yet to receive any explanation or apology for this inconvenience. So if you need multiple mice without a hassle, look elsewhere.So far as the mouse is concerned, I have no complaints about it. The eMacs recognized and used the mice without any issues, although it only recognized the two primary buttons (left and right click) and the scroll wheel. I opted for the excellent shareware ""USB Overdrive"" to program the other buttons and never had a problem. The mouse is surprisingly light for its size which makes controlling it a little odd at times. My 14 year old nephew had no problem adapting to it, but my 9 year old nephew was constantly overshooting things until I turned down the sensitivity. The mice have been operating for 7+ months without complaint, so I don't have any complaints either",0
4588,"GREAT. I bought a pair of these earphones a few months ago and they are great. The sound quality is excelent, the external noise isolation is amazing! It comes with 3 sets of rubbers to ajust to your ears so the match is perfect.I would definitely buy them again",0
4589,Lots of discs are a very good thing... As a person who has used lots of writable CD and DVD products I would highly recommend this product. I have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product. If your storage needs are under 650 + megabytes I would buy this product. Note : This product needs several Megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 Merabytes of your data. For the price listed this ad it is a great deal as well..,0
4590,"Great Buy. This product is worth buying.  Great price compared to the store prices.Wasnt hard to to put up and plenty of space to put wires in back. Just need to adjust for beam 12' ready for a  19' beam size, but it wasnt a big deal",0
4591,"Fantastic!!!. I received my Bravia today.  It is incredibe, even without an HD source--got my HD cable box being installed Monday, can't wait.  No problems with delivery.  Setup is a breeze, remote is excellent in my opinion.  Video is superb and the sound wonderful, whcih is really nice since I don't hear well.  All pros and no cons",0
4592,What a bargain!. Easy to install! I finally got rid of my old CD player.  This was easy to fill with CD's.,0
4593,"Very cool, very useful, and very informative. I was a bit dubious about swapping out my regular cyclocomputer, especially for the extra dollars. Could something like the Edge 205 really give me that much more than the distance, speed, and time information I usually acquired with my $30 computer? Well, after a few rides with the 205, I can say that I'm a fan. The thing went on in a jiffy, works like a charm, and gives me all sorts of information I didn't have before. Wonder why that hill is so tough? Well, dummy, it's 13% grade. Didn't know that before. Wonder how much of that ride was spent ascending? Oh, about 1/3. Didn't know that before. How much climbing did I do on that ride? Oh, about 2,500 feet. Didn't know that before. And all this from a ride I've done at least a dozen times, and one I consider to be a ""throwaway"" training ride. A very cool, useful, and informative device. Well done, Garmin",0
4594,"Grey, not black. Nice custom fitted case for the Tom Tom One.  I was disappointed with the misleading advertising photos which portray a black case.  You actually get a dull grey case.  On the other hand, the case is nicely labeled with the Tom Tom One logos. There is no room for any extra cords (eg. USB or auto charger)",0
4595,"Great Printer for the money. The printer arrived as promised and following the simple set up instructions, I was able to print my first document in less than 20 minutes.  The print quality is outstanding! For home office or home use, this printer is a great value for the price",0
4596,"Nearly all in one!!. This device has nearly everything you can wish for:- Fm Tuner,Speakers,ability to load using Windows drag and drop and not have to use Media player, with the optional accessory you can charge the device without being near a computer. The finish is great and the speaker sound for the size is quite good.The only thing missing is the ability to create a play list on the fly in the device.",0
4597,Good. This is a good webcam for a first timer (which i am)altough the camera sends the sound b4 the picture so its not excactly in sync all the time,0
4598,"If you like Tivo and XM radio then you'll like this player. First things first: this is NOT a portable XM radio. It can only receive live XM broadcasts when docked with the included cradle and satellite antenna. But you can connect this to your stereo and listen without earplugs. But the best feature is the ability to record XM radio for later playback--just live Tivo.So at home you can listen through your stereo speakers, and then if you're  away from home it acts just like an iPOD. This is better than the current portable XM radios since with those you cannot predict what kind of signal strength you'll get when on the go. The menu system is great, although the buttons are small. You can record any channel at any time, and build your own playlists. Everything you need comes included in the box except for the car kit, which is a separate purchase. For the price this device delivers everything I expected. I'm even thinking about buying another one!",0
4599,"Video Converter. I purchased the Plextor converter on advice of NERO.  They claimed that it would be compatible with their software.  After I plugged it in and tried to convert my tape, the system froze.  That happened several times.  I wrote about this to NERO, they asked me to send them a report.  I did that.  That was almost two weeks ago.  I am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses.  You may want to contact NERO directly, however, I doubt if it will work.In future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product(s).Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the service I have received from you as I bought many other items through you.Martha Pelensk",0
4600,"Ideal for a standard entertainment setup. This remote saved my nightstand space and has brought me great joy.  I didn't have as much of an issue with the SET key as the other reviewers did, though I would recommend being a bit forceful with the buttons when programming items in.  As far as other qualities are concerned, the remote is extremely durable, having been dropped on the hardwood floor no less than 30 times and still working perfectly.  It has been on the same set of batteries for about 2 years now, and has never given me any trouble.  It's a very solid remote control for a good price",0
4601,"Great deal!. This is a very nice printer, especially for the price. Quick printing, good quality",0
4602,"Almost completely compatible... This remote works very well, but I only have two gripes...1. The real Apple Remote sends a return instead of a space for the play button, and so applications that expect that, like EyeTV's full screen menu mode, do not work.  However, it does mean that it can pause iTunes and other apps directly without having to use Front Row at all.2. The signal could be a little more powerful, I think.  The angle where you hold it does actually matter at times",0
4603,Great Product. This turntable exceeds my expectations.  Works smoothly and quietly.  Also is much sturdier than I expected,0
4604,"Pretty Good Book Thing. Sometimes I need to have a few books open at the same time, and still have clear desk space for note taking. I used to keep one in my lap, or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page, or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so I could open another.  Not any more! Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway??  This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares? You're not going to loose them unless you've got a silver shag rug that's three inches deep, and it's not a big deal to pop them back in.In truth I have two of these pretty good book things",0
4605,"good camera for the price i guess. i still think the picture could be better, common it's 2007 already!!  works great with msn messenger",0
4606,Great Machine but be cautious if you're a Mac user!. This is a great all-in-one copying and printing machine but works poorly with apple computers!  We have had so many problems setting it up with our computers since we purchased it a month ago and even after getting help from Brother's tech support (with limited knowledge on Macs) we still can't get the machine to function at its full capacity.,0
4607,"great product. The product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what I wanted.  I have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera, but will try to soon",0
4608,A great printer. This is the only printer I found that did everything I wanted:- network connectivity (using wired)- 2 trays- duplex printing- inkjet w/photo quality- actually a fast printerI've had a 6840DT for over a year and been thrilled. I just got the 6980 for a client and expect them to be as happy as I have been,0
4609,"look good, sound good. these speakers look exactly as they appear in the photos. They have a clean, simple stylish design. They sound as good as we can expect for a speaker of the size enclosure. Maybe they sound even better than average. Mounting was as easy as 2 screws (not supplied) in the supplied brackets. There are several mounting options. The only negative is that the mounting brackets are 2 direction hinges and not swivel. No big deal, I knew that when I purchased",0
4610,"Works perfectly!. I've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly. It has seen thousands of photos (no exaggeration!) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too. Did you know you can pop your SD card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos? I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one. If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller ""MiniSD"")",0
4611,"Just what I was looking for. This little device is everything I wanted and I got it from Amazon for a good price too.Pros:* size* sound* features (radio, video, pictures, etc)* supports subscription service that I already useCons:* none that I can find unless the battery dies since it cannot be replaced by the userI also have had a Zen Micro 5GB for the past couple of years and, aside from its headphone jack problem, have loved it too. I'm planning on keeping it to use for a recorder instead of taking notes.",0
4612,"Amazing!!!!. This ihome is like the best thing to get your ipod! Its has quality sound, and you can listen to the radio! The best part is that you can set you alarm to listen to your ipod when you wake up! Man, you people who think this is Ok or bad, are CRAZY",0
4613,"Does its job well. This case is perfectly functional and actually looks good.  It is transluscent with a circular cut-out on the back for the Apple logo, so it doesn't hide the beautiful color you chose your iPod Mini for.  It protects the body and screen while allowing access to all the relevant buttons and ports.  The silicone gives a better grip than smooth plastic, so not only will it protect your iPod if you drop it, but you'll be less likely to drop it.  I cannot speak for every example of the product, but I will say that mine is totally odorless.It is true that the screen tends to collect dust and lint, but it is easy enough to wash off (after removing the iPod)",0
4614,"Great For XM kinda Okay for MP3. When i first got this device it was okay with it i liked that it can record XM which i find really awesome. But if you are a Subscription music fan (napster,Yahoo places like that) then here is the down side to this product. If this product supported subscription based music it would of gotten all 5 stars but it got a 4 but overall Sound Quality is great menues are great battery life is awesome memory is awesome but the MP3 with subscription music *point fingers down* not good. Hopes that Samsung will release a Firmware update to support Subscription music cause i don't wanna wait for a song that i want to listen to play on XM so that i can record it so 4 Stars",0
4615,"Good value for money. Batteries have quite a long life, and recharging takes one hour",0
4616,Excellent Value. This was an excellent purchase. As we all know about the outrageous prices for HDMI cables from Monster. This cable which is connected to my cable box  ti nt Samsung LN S2341W LCD display provides a noticeably improved picture from the component cables. It reduces the motion artifacts that you get from LCD TVs when you have fast moving images to the point where it is non existent. All for under $10,0
4617,Excellent delivery. We were amazed how fast we received our leapfrog wireless remote control.  We couldn't have been happier with the price and the service of delivery. Thank you.,0
4618,"Great Product!!!. I just bought one of these at Linens & Things for $29.95, minus the 20% coupon that was in my Sunday newspaper. It's great! Took me less than five minutes to assemble without tools. I'm also confused by the negative reviews. All the pieces were carefully wrapped in plastic...no scratches. I wouldn't use it to put heavy objects on, but it will be perfect to use as a table to eat dinner in front of the TV, or for playing solitare. I'm sure my mom will love it!!",0
4619,"Great to have mixable media for travel. A recent review I read in PC Magazine where they felt the ATRACformat was noisy, not the case. A disk I started (using ATRAC) sounds roughly as good as some disks I dubbed using an MD deck some time earlier. Hence my decision to go with this technology as opposed to the FLASH RAM or hard drive based devices since I already had an MD library. It sounds pretty good, not great as it is a portable device and my ears are pretty good for such things. I hope it lasts a while because looks like Sony is getting ready to bail on the MD format and I don't want return to make any more Sony electronics (non-media) purchases. Don't get me started on the rootkit nonsense because I believe the music execs all deserve jail for creating a new conduit for spyware",0
4620,"Fine. As usual for any order by or through Amazon the price was right, the delivery was fine and the product fine",0
4621,"Very Good TV. I'm very happy with the set.  Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.The picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I'm very happy",0
4622,"Good!. When I first opened it up, I thought it kinda looked shabby.  Its made out of plastic but doesn't look rly shabby...just kinda.I really like the 3 extra USB, 1 Compact Flash, SD, MS, and 2 others which I have never used.This the USB to USB from the cooler to the laptop must be plugged into the laptop to use and the power adapter is optional.  There are 2 fans in the center and over all its pretty good.Any other questions or inquiries you can email me at koldfyre@gmail.co",0
4623,"absolutely good one. I bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work. When i hooked up the cable between my laptop and TV, wow.... this is really worth a buy.",0
4624,"excellent. It took a few minutes to figure out how to slide the things all the way into my ear, but after i got it down, they work beautifully!  No quality reduction, just volume reduction.  Wonderful product for the price",0
4625,A Great Accessory for the Gym. The iRiver pops easily into the holder and stays there. I like the angle at which the iRiver faces while in the holder because it allows you to easily adjust the volume or change tracks without twisting it away from your arm to see the controls,0
4626,1 GHz memory card. Great memory card for the price.  I would highly recommen,0
4627,Works as Advertised. This product simply worked as advertized. The quality of music from my mp3 player through my car's premium sound system does not appear to be degraded in any way. If you have a cassette player on your car's sound system and you enjoy listening to your mp3 player then this product is a must,0
4628,"Very Pleased. I'm not really a ""get in there and mess around"" computer guy, but this card was a great purchase. Pop it in, connect the tv cord, install the program, and you're watching tv on your computer! You may think you're lazy, but you haven't experienced lazy until you find yourself not having to turn and to watch tv.Did I mention the pause/record features? One of the problems I have with following shows on tv is it's so confining watching a show at one particular time, and then sitting through it without distractions; now I can record shows to watch at a later date. The pause is useful too, I can step away from some random ""Seinfeld"" episode and catch up when I get back, not because I care so much, just because it's so convenient.I recommend a couple of things though. A big hard drive would be nice; some movies, sporting programs, or sitcoms can really add up, especially when recording at a high quality. Also something to save these videos, be it through editing or a DVD-burning program. Editing commercials out and transferring video to a different format can save a lot of space. It's also useful if you just want clips of a program, perfect for an upload to YouTube or etc. Also, you can save those videos you really want on DVDs and delete them off your computer.Overall well worth the price of admission, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it",0
4629,"Sony TV Stand. We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.

Very nicely designed, along with being good looking",0

It's highly irritating.  I paid $1491 at Sams Club + $5.00 to extend the warranty for 1 year.  If I have any problems whatsoever I will just bring it to Sams for a complete refund.Problem 2.  Remote control keeps turning off the TV even when using volume, channel, etc.  Called Samsung - They are shipping me a new remote.Colors are beautiful - TV is awesome!If I can get rid of the buzz sound I'll keep the TV.  Otherwise I'll return it and keep looking",0

This is a reliable unit and very easy to use. I have recommended it to friends, who were equally pleased. I also bought several for our portable LANs at work, and those have functioned beautifully, too. In summary, this is a great product that I highly recommend to those looking for a foolproof and easy to use cable/DSL router with robust firewall",0
4634,happy so far. i am pleased with the projector so far. i i am using it on the wall at a distance of about 10 feet that gives me a 100 inch wide screen. colors are good sound is okay. i am running it though my hp laptop with windows media center edition. i have a tv tuner card with cable tv hooked up so this is my tv. i also play pc games with it which are awesome. love the carry bag that comes with it. great  product/price,0
4635,"Sony RDCW500C CD Player/Recorder. Nice as a 5 CD changer. OK as a recorder. I wanted this to convert 33 RPM Records to CD's. Many times I need to use a separate CD for each side.--not covered in Manual of on-line FAQ's.The manual is a little weak. This is consumer electronics not computer hardware/software and more information, more easily understood, would help.The Changer is large (deep) and may not fit in some shelves. Not a problem for me and the construction is typical Sony; heavy and apparently well-constructed.When a 33 RPM is well-preserved, you get a nice recording. When there are scratches, dirt, etc., you get what yu created when you originally played the records. If the turntable does not have a pre-amp, you need to add one",0
4636,"Excellent phone. Have had several Panasonics and after reading on-line reviews, decided to try something else. I had several problems with the Panasonics. I own a Motorola cell phone & really like it because it is easy to use. The same goes for the new cordless I bought. Great phone, modern design, clear sound, lighted hand set wit a speakerphone in it, intercom, answering machine and a very cool looking blue light that signals you a message has been left. I am very impressed with this phone and will buy another handset soon. Only thing is I wish it had speed dial, but it works very similarly to a cell phone, so getting to the phonebook is fine",0

I got these after purchasing a Denon 2807 mostly for it's HDMI ability and feeling that it was being underutilized on my stereo speakers.I picked them up at Fry's for $199 and I must say that I think they sound great.  I haven't got a lot of room to fill (perhaps 15ft x 25ft) and I didn't want anything too loud as I live in an apartment complex, but the sound definitely fills the room and the frequency ranges sound very well represented.I haven't got much else to compare them too, but I think that even though they may not be the latest model, that a name brand for this price shouldn't be overlooked",0
4651,excellent product. I have used HP's toner cartridge most of the time for my 10 year old HP Laserjet Printer. It gives good black printing and lasts a very long time so the up front cost is worth it,0
4652,"Best wireless keyboard I've used. I got this keyboard about a month ago, and I've been using it regularly since.   It's very nice compared to other wireless keyboards because it's symmetrical, so you can put it in your lap and type on it - there's no numeric keypad sticking out on the right.   If you're a heavy numeric keypad user, this will be a problem for you, but if your life is spent more on the home row, it's really nice not to have all that extra junk off to the right.The reason I rate it four stars rather than five is that the function keys are a real problem - I occasionally hit them accidentally, because they are proximity/capacitive sensors rather than actual keys.   I'd rather they weren't there at all.   However, after using the keyboard for a month, I hit them much less often, so if you like the feel of the keyboard in general, as I do, this is probably not a deal-killer.I'm using it with my Mac, running OSX 10.4.   The OSX driver doesn't support any of the extra features of the keyboard other than the volume control and mute button, so for example the trackpad doesn't work.   This is unfortunate, but I can definitely live with it.The mouse is heavy and I don't use it much, because I prefer a trackpad, but it does seem to work well with the Mac.   The recharging station is a nice touch - I wish the keyboard was also rechargeable.One thing to be aware of with this keyboard is that there's a learning curve for using it, and if you type Dvorak-style, you can't switch the keycaps around, because they're kind of smeared into a crescent, which means that some of the keys at the center of the keyboard are sized differently than the other keys.   For me it took a day to type well on it, and when I've been typing on my laptop keyboard for a while, going back requires a bit of re-learning.   But if you type a lot, and the features of this keyboard generally appeal, I don't think this is a barrier to using it.All in all, the nicest keyboard I've tried in a long time.   Ted sez check it out",0
4653,Awesome. 4 gig in such a small package.  It is so great to have to not worry about if you have enough room or not while on the road.

4656,"HAD TO HAVE THE RPN LOGIC. The price of this calculator was about twice as much as I wanted to pay, but I had to have the RPN capability.  When you have used an RPN calculator as long as I have, it's difficult to change.  The metric conversion functions were a must have feature for me also.  The one thing I dislike the most about this calculator is the key layout.  The keys are not layed out straight across, but rather they are in a ""V"" orientation.  If you are single finger user as I am, you will miss some keys",0

4659,"Great First Time GPS. I just received my X930 and used it to hunt down garage sales in a large city near my small town.  It cut my time in half.  No, it doesnt know all the shortcuts I know, but I didn't buy it to take me on the routes I already know.  It found all the addresses I put in, which were quite a few, except for one that was in a new subdivision currently being constructed, understandable.  It even put up with me taking my shortcuts against its wishes and ended up rerouting to my shortcuts.  I'm sure it doesnt compete with Garmin, but for the price you can't beat it.

4662,"Ipod who? Zune who?. This is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. What makes it the best?1. 16 million color 2.5 LCD touchscreen.2. Battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video.3. The best sound, it has how much tweaks, its sick. You can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. Has BBE,Wide stereo, enhancement stereo etc.4. The volume is sooo dam loud. I had a Zune and the volume level was at 20, the lourdest it could go. The D2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune.5. You can encode AVI video bitrate at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps.6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive.7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own.8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys.9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations.10. Can view .txt files.11. Can view pics at very high pixels.12. Fm tuner, you can record from the FM radio. You can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps.13. Has a SD slot for more storage. Get a 8 gig SD for a total for 12 gig. Imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig SD.14. Great support, firmware updates are always available.Plus sooo much more",0

4674,"Excellent, but not for the vinyl traditionalist... (Updated 03 April 2005) The AT440ML is widely regarded as a great quality phono cartridge, but there *is* some controversy.  I've been using this cartridge for well over a year now, and my opinion is that it has a very ""modern"" sound -- its tonal balance is almost an imitation of the typical CD player.  Not that that's bad... it's just that many vinyl fans prefer the ""midbass bloom"" warmth and other traditional qualities of the so-called vinyl sound, and this cartridge doesn't have it -- if you prefer that kind of sound and are on a budget, look into one of the high-end Stantons.  This one does tend to be a bit ""V-Curvish"" tonally, with a bit more emphasis on bass and treble than on midrange (as well as being a bit bright and/or thin sounding with certain systems).  You'll really just have to hear this cartridge with your particular setup to decide whether you like it or not.  IMO, the great thing about vinyl is that it's all about what we find pleasing (euphonic), not some unattainable standard of absolute accuracy.As far as tracking goes, this one's a winner.  Not only does it track better than 99% of cartridges out there, but it's highly detailed as well -- the stylus shape is designed to dig every bit of detail out of the groove.  Surprisingly, this *does not* seem to come at the expense of more surface noise.  If anything, this cartridge is pretty quiet and you'll hear less surface noise than average.  I'm sure the light tracking force (VTF) helps in this regard.Mounting-wise, I found this cartridge a bit more difficult than most.  Part of the thing is I was trying to be more exacting than usual, because a Microline stylus can eat your records if it's mounted poorly.  I did encounter a minor channel imbalance which was eventually corrected.  Unless you're really skilled at mounting cartridges, be prepared to take some time with this one.  In particular, you may want to play with VTA (if your tonearm supports it) to avoid a sound that's too thin and bright.Overall, I'd say at around $100 this one's a real bargain.  It's very nearly a mismatch with my Thorens TP16 tonearm, but with modern lightweight tonearms it should be perfect.  If you do get it for use with a vintage turntable with a medium-mass tonearm (like the TP16) be advised that you're working at the very outer edges of this cart's tolerances and you may encounter issues with warped discs, etc.  For me the price was worth it though... for less than $100 you get true audiophile quality, albeit with some flaws.  There's an effortless quality to this cartridge's performance, one that generally only comes with really expensive models.  Recommended",0
4675,"Does what I bought it to do. I wanted something inexpensive to use to remotely advance my PowerPoint slides in my college classes.  This does the job perfectly for under $30.  It does not have a lot of bells and whistles (which I intentionally avoided as unneeded and, therefore, not worth the extra cost). The only thing I wish it had--which some of these do have--is a way to insert the USB portion into the clicker portion for storage. It did come with a storage pouch for the two parts, but carrying one would be nicer",0

Honestly, if you are not sure what you're doing with a board like this in the first place, I would recommend sticking with Dell systems.  There are countless available non-ASUS resources readily available around the net.  There are many forums out there that have hundreds of thousands of members who help each other out with what settings to use, what BIOS versions are the most stable etc.This motherboard is for the extreme over clocker in mind.  Coming from the regular A8N-SLI Deluxe, it was a big step up as far as over clocking options are concerned.  Not only that but this board is feature packed with nice passive cooling.  It has more options that you could wish for.

4693,"Great Starter or Back-Up !!!. I am partial to Uniden anyway, however this CB is great for a first time user or as a back up to a more expensive unit.  I have been using CB for about 10 years and I always make sure I have a Uniden 510 available for a back up, or use it in a second car.  It has superior range when used with a good antenna and the received audio is decent. I would suggest using an external speaker unless you have a super quiet vehicle. The anl switch cuts through static really well to improve reception, although it sometimes dulls out the audio of the person you are trying to hear. You can use it with a cigarette lighter plug with an adapter from radio shack for a few dollars.  They will even show you how to hook it up.  It all boils down to being a great CB at a great price.  Remember a simple rule of thumb... An inexpensive CB on a good antenna will perform just as well as a high-end CB on a cheap antenna.  Don't forget to tune your antenna and have fun",0

I just bought another one (in April 2006) for $10 from an Amazon.com reseller (brand new in original packaging), set it on the higher setting, and for the first time in months, I haven't received any telemarketer calls. Before that, I was getting up to 10 per day. THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!! I just hope it continues to work. Some people say it doesn't work. On the lower setting, it didn't for me either. But on the higher one, it did the trick. I don't like the sounds it makes before you dial or answer a call (like the disconnect tones), but you get used to it. I'm surprised such a product still works after being out for so many years, and that the telemarketers haven't found a way around it (though I'm sure some calls can still get through); like the saying goes: Building a better mouse trap.

4703,"Nice Minimalist Amp with Strange Feature. My feature-laden Yamaha RX-577 receiver/amp finally gave up after 11 years of service, and since we now live in the country with little or no radio reception, I looked for a simple amplifier, with simple controls and adequate capacity (hint on the meaning of ""adequate"" - I am no longer 19).  This amp is an understated black box, with basic minimalist styling and simple controls that adjust balance and volume, and speaker outputs to A and B.  It does a fine job on my average home stereo system.  I concur with other reviewers that the silly feature of automatically turning itself to a stand-by state when no input signal is present is essentially useless on any kind of music other than the constant drone of Scottish bagpipes or techno.  Between tracks of a CD, or even in silent pauses in music, it dutifully and maddeningly turns itself ""off"", and then, oops! - back on again when the music resumes - after missing a few measures, of course.  Happily this feature is only present on line 1 of the system.  If you use line 2 as your primary source, it overrides line 1.  As an engineer, I find this logic perplexing.  Since when should a secondary line signal override the primary signal? Who thought of that? Anyway, this is the only fix that I know of to stop the automatic stand-by feature, and it does work.Beyond that user-correctable deficiency, if you don't need 110+db sound anymore (or never did), this amp is a highly suitable piece of equipment that appears well built, is simple to use and understand, and simple to hook up.  It is relatively heavy for its size, and like watermelons, heaviness potentially equals quality, especially with things that supply power.I am overall quite satisfied with this amp",0

Both are magnetic mount antennas. The lil' Wil antenna is a relatively small antenna and it's only around $39.00. Actually any Wilson CB antenna will be fine. Also, to do a good job at setting up your antenna you should purchase an SWR meter. They are not expensive. You only need the meter connected inline between the radio and antenna when you are adjusting the antenna. Once you are done adjusting the antenna you can take the meter out of the connection and connect the antenna directly to the radio. Don't be fooled by cheap ordinary CB antennas like you will find at radio shack. Do not settle for anything less then a Wilson antenna. Cobra and Uniden both make fabulous CB radios so either make will be fine",0

Having the plugs is critical - you don't want to have to worry about batteries when travelling - but it does mean that, eg, you can't take this system as easily to the beach. The sound is good enough (you're never going to get great sound with travel speakers), and it fantastically charges your ipod while you listen to music, which is great.  My biggest complaint is that the audio re-sets to a default (and quite loud) level every time you turn it on or off, so you just have to remember to turn the volume down at work before you hit play. Definitely worth buying tho",0
4726,"Absolutely Amazing. This is the best TV on the market!  Consumer Reports ranks it number one again this year (500U last year).  Please turn the settings down out of the box though.  Panasonic puts the TV in the horrid ""Vivid"" mode which makes you feel like you got ripped off, but once you turn down the settings the TV couldn't look any better.  The sound quality is excellent for non-auxillary sound.  CableCard, PIP, VGA input, better sound and much nicer bezel than the 60U were the reasons I chose this one over the 60U",0

4731,"My first one broke within a week. I bought this unit after reading the reviews here. I really like it. It is great for plugging in your ipod at work or on a trip. My first one broke, so I returned it. The new one works fine. I followed the link left on the comments section regarding the fact that no generation 2 nano adapter was included. The company sent me one in the mail for free. For the money ($109 on Amazon), I could not find a better unit. The Bose is too expensive and the logitech did not sound as good. The altec lansing slim speaker unit also did not sound as well. This unit has a remote, charges the ipod, and has a rechargeable battery to allow day trips to the beach. I recommend it barring the bad unit I got initially",0

4733,Love it!. I just got it today and I love it. It's a regular alarm clock with a nap timer. It's easy to use and the nap timer button is awesome. I like to take 30 min naps in the afternoon so I set the timer for 30 min (it has a memory) and all I need to do now is to press the nap button and it wakes me up after 30 min.It's has a nice blue night light and the numbers are big enough so that those who wear glasses can read the time without having to put their glasses on. It works with 2 AA batteries and at its current it's a real bargain.,0
4734,"Awesome Sportsband. I recently bought the sportsband for my nano ipod to go with the sports kit, and it's great.  It's much better than the nike armband imo because you can actually see the screen and you don't have to buy the (ugly) 100 dollar shoes.  Also, I don't have to worry now about my ipod falling out like other bands, and the transmitter/receiver thing is safely snugged inside the pouch while running.  One thing though is because im running and sweating, it makes it a lil difficult to adjust the volume but thats expected with any band and sweaty hands. Other than that its perfect. I definitely would suggest this to anyone who doesnt want to buy the nike armband and shoe.",0
4735,"Good & cheap. You lose the retail packaging and get to steal 2GB for twenty-some dollars from a reputable company.  I tripled the storage capacity of my $250 smart phone with this $20+ disc.

The USB port comes in very handy with labtops etc.You can put songs in 4 libraries and it even has a graphic equalizer.  It also comes with a handy dictaphone which is good for students to use.However I started having lines run through my player after 2 days use, creative were helpful but Amazon have been pathetic in dealing with the return. I have been waiting since January for Amazon to give me a refund. They claim they could not deliver the package to me for some unknown reason (undeliverable) even though I had my new address on the return item box",0
4737,Works even if your shuffle is in a case. The included Shuffle dock is great... unless your Shuffle is in a case.  It's a pain to remove the case each time you want to sync or charge so this is a great alternative since it will connect even if your iPod Shuffle is clothed.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that Apple should take notice.  This is a small and efficient design and works as expected.  Good price for a good product.  I purchased based on a favorable review from geekbrief.tv.,0
4738,"Perfect if you're a minimalist. So I waited a few weeks before i got my MoGo but now that i have it i love it. I am not a fan of clutter and dragging things along with me so i have not bought a mouse because i didnt want to find a spot for it and worry about the wireless adapter sticking out and such. It is very much a mouse for a road warrior. storing it right in my PC Card slot is pure genius and the fact that it charges there is just the icing on the cake. I was worried that being so little it would be uncomfortable but after a little bit you dont even notice its so small. you use the same 4 fingers that youd use to control a normal sized mouse except you dont feel the body in your palm. The range is excellent too, ive used it during power point presentations to click slides over as well. I have yet to test the 30 foot range but im sure it wouldnt be a problem. The only thing i dont like is that there is no scroll wheel. I know that the size of it makes it hard to have a wheel but maybe a touch wheel like one some laptops could have been  possible. its a little pricer than most other mice but the convience and performance cant be beat. I dont regret my purchase one bit. I doubt ill ever loose it either because of how its stored. All in all a good bu",0

I looked at several similar models and was drawn to this one for the price and picture quality.  I do have two complaints.  My Dish Network universal remote won't operate the tv.  When I called Dish Network they said that it couldn't be programmed.  My other complaint is the sound quality.  It is really bad.  I ended up buying some Bose computer speakers and they plugged right in.  A VAST improvement.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase",0

4747,"great monitor, great price. Overall I found this to be a very good monitor at a fantastic price.  I am a picky buyer, and am contemplating buying another one!  I use it for business, movies, and occasional photo editing.  That said, I found the buying process to be horribly confusing and spent days trying to figure out exactly what the differences are between any two LCDs.  Here are some thoughts to aid your search:1) the 206BW is Samsung's most recent 20"" wide screen monitor.  the 205BW and 204BW are its predecessors, are inferior, and are still sold in stores. the 206BW appears to be a big improvement over the 205BW.  2206bw is the corresponding 22"" monitor.2) the 20"" monitor appears to be the sweet spot of the line.  the 19"" has lower pixel count, the 22"" has the same pixel count as 20"".  The .258 pixel pitch of this monitor is also among the best I have seen for a consumer grade monitor.  the 19"" and 22"" both have worse pixel pitch3) this monitor gives a very large work space.  I can comfortably have two documents, spreadsheets, etc. side by side.  At 1600+ / 1000+ it has 10-15% more pixels, and a ton more space than my laptop.  I was initially considering a non-wide-screen monitor.  I am pleased that I chose this instead.4) movies look fantastic.  dark scenes particularly look better than they did on both my old CRT display and on my laptop LCD5) monitors appear to have similar specs across manufacturers for their generation.  this monitor appears to have been just released (3/1/2007), and has industry leading specs- 2ms response rate, 3000:1 dynamic contrasts, etc.  Samsung's competitors (Viewsonic, etc) did not have comparable products when I bought.  If you are tempted to by a product with lesser specs that may be marketed as ""better,"" find out if this is actually the case, or if it is just an old design.  LCD lines seem to turn over every 6-12 months.6) stay away from monitors with speakers.  reviews consistently pan them as gimicky and non-functional, and they add size and cost7) one drawback is that the monitor stand is not adjustable.  If you care, buy a good stand.  there are standard interconnects on the back.  it should work with this or any future monitor you buy.  for my money, I would rather have a product with better performance than a more functional stand.I have no comments on life as I have had the product for under a week.happy shopping!",0
4748,Sony ICF-CD73V Shower CD Player/Clock Radio (White). I love this radio/cd player/clock radio. I actually do use it in the shower every day. It has really good sound quality.

4749,"Works great most of the time. I love the way this mouse just feels when its using it and everything is working correctly... but sometimes when I boot up my computer it just doesn't work.Occasionally the reciever won't pick up a good enough signal (it might just be interference) but then it gets all jittery and unusable even after the mouse is reset. Only other complaint I have is the options you have for the extra buttons under Windows XP, I prefer how other software allows you to just set them as ""MOUSE4"" and ""MOUSE5"" for gaming.This aside, the mouse feels great, moves super smooth and accurate when working. It also has a power on/off button which is a godsend when transporting (and therfore not ruining the battery) and the inivisble optic is just great (less annoying)",0
4750,"Great notebook case. This case is great for value and for space..for the most part. It's actually really hard to find a good value leather case for a 15.4 notebook, but this was it. Unfortunately though not much room for any other types of peripheral, ie notebook mouse, once my adaptor and power cord went in, as nothing else but my notebook fits in that compartment so they had to go in another, but all in all, really nice case, and not too heavy being leather either. Another good point ladies is that its looks are relatively unisex, not too masculine but not too feminine either. Highly recommended",0

My only complaint is having to work through the menu to correct the settings if the lock slips off while in my pocket.",0
4752,"Great Headset. I have had for a few days now and I can say this headset is very good quality. For the ventrillo problem one person had in a earlier comment, I just adjust the vollume controlls and mic controlls for about 10 mins till and got it to come in clear and without background noise.  Works best with the razer sound card.The Mic is a small little plug in to the left ear part. This may be a small problem for the size so when/if you unplugg it you may loose it so keep it in a good place.  From what I have been told even with the fact its not near my mouth its clear and pressent over vent.The sound is very nice even for the price of the headset. I can easily define the music, game, and vent each seperatly when they are all on at the same time.The comfort is preety decent. Fits over ears well and the strap adjusts just when you put it over your head.There isn't too much to make this better but, I will list some anyways.  With the sound, they could add a driver to have it adjust to even certain music, games, effects and so forth (just fixed with a driver).  With the mic, maybe they could have it able to extend a bit so it comes closer to the mouth and you wouldn't have the adjust the sound properties (if you need to like I did).  Finaly they could cus the cost of this or at least of thier sound card so I can buy to hear the full potential.Over all I would give a 5 of 5 but they still could do better on it, but if you have the cash to dish out by all means get this",0

4759,"Improved Reception. I bought my Mom a small TV/VCR combo for her bedroom.  We first used standard cables (from a well known electric company), and had a drab, mediocre, run-of-the mill picture.                                                      When the MV2F's arrived (4 meter - from Amazon.com, of course), the picture changed dramatically. Better colors, better resolution, better everything.  The reception was so good on the 13 inch bedroom, my parents watched it more than the 32 inch in the family room.    My Mother wanted to know why Monster wasn't on all the TV's in the house.                                                    I did order the MV3F's and Z series for the larger 32 inch set ... which died before the cables arrived. The 32"" was replaced by a nice, heavy, 27"" Sony Flat.  The cables did arrive in time for the new TV.  The TV man couldn't believe the picture.  It never had a picture that good, in the store, even when playing a DVD.                                         I read other customer reviews, at Amazon.com, before my first Monster purchase.  The best review said, in effect, that Monster will make your TV do all it can do, it won't make it a better TV.  For the new TV's in my parents house...the difference was major.    M",0

4768,"100% better then the armband it comes with. This is one ofthose items where simlpe-stupid seems to work best.  The armband that the iRiver comes with is one of the most poorly designed items I have come across.  The hook-and-eye closure limits the range of sizing options and is nearly impossible to secure using one hand! Makes me wonder if anyone at iRiver ever tried it out.  This armband, however, is great!  It is elastic enough to be comfortable when your arm is relaxed or flexed (unlike the included armband, which was made of non-stretching neoprene and can cut off circulation when your bicep is flexed) I am also a big jogger and the elastic is stiff enough that the player won't bounce around or slide down your arm and you don't need to cinch it very tightly to be secure.The case is great - it is a hard-but-rubbery type of material and instead of having a solid loop to attach it to the armband it has a belt clip (much like what you find on cell phone belt clips)  I have found that i'm using the clip more frequently then I would have imagined - on the neck of my shirt, the strap to my backpack, on my back pocket, etc.  Basically, it's convenient that you can pop the player off the armband and just clip it anywhere on your body.This accessory is a great solution to the cumbersome (and fairly unattractive) arm band they included with the players",0

The 'buds do very well blocking outside noise due to the rubber earpieces, which come in three sizes to make it easier to get a good fit.  I did notice that the 'buds sounded tinny if I used the wrong size earpiece, so anyone who is unhappy with the sound might try a different size: you need that good seal to get the best sound.And great customer service - the 'buds I got from Amazon developed a short and stopped working within the first week.  I sent an email to Skull Candy describing the problem (as instructed from their website), and had an RMA number and an address to mail the defective set to in 24 hours.

I find myself dabbling at this keyboard almost daily.  This isn't a very technical review.  But from one parent to another, feel confident that this is an excellent purchase.  I'm very glad that I didn't spend $600+ on a digital piano.  I recommend the Yamaha LC3 stand for this keyboard.  It is not listed as an option but after calling Yamaha, they suggested it as well.

4780,"Buy this plasma and you won't regret it!. After a year and a half of price watching and comparison, I purchased this plasma from Amazon for $1149.  What a deal.  Eagle shipped and set up in my house within 7 days of completing the order.  I use satellite for my HDTV and recently purchased a UHF amplified antenna for local channels.  I was shocked at the quality of the over the air broadcast.  It is actually equal to the satellite.  The picture is flawless and i don't get any buzzing that some of the other reviewers complained about.  This is the best TV I have ever seen!  Even the channels that don't broadcast in HD look great!  I tried cable HD but canceled and went with satellite when I saw the difference at a friends house.  No comparison.  I recommend setting all of the video to 50.  The vivid setting is just not realistic.  You can move the brightness and contrast up to 60 in a darker room.  Any higher and you do get some pixelation in some darker scenes.  I run my video through the 2 HDMI connections and my audio through my surround sound receiver.  I tried the internal speakers just to get an idea of the quality of sound and it was fine.  Can't really compare to a good 7.1 system though.  The plasmas in the big department stores don't do these screens justice.  With an up converting  1080i DVD player that I also purchased through Amazon, I am totally satisfied.  They say these plasmas will last far longer that the old tube tv's.  I hope so.  The only thing I would change about this Plasma is the gloss black frame.  It looks great until you turn on a light or get sun in the background.  If it was matte finish there wouldn't be any glare at all from the side of the picture but in a dark room that wouldn't matter anyway.  I really can't say enough about this plasma.

4782,"iM716 ..........current bargain amongst iem's. This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in ""hi-fi"" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion.The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening.",0
4783,"The best I could find. Before purchasing this case, I researched iPod cases for over a month, and even purchased and later returned a different case. I wanted something that would really protect the iPod--not just from scratches, but really protect it in case of falls, etc.  Also, being an ardent admirer of the simple beauty of Apple's design, I was loathe to purchase a case that would totally obscure the beauty of the iPod.  This case was the clear winner on both counts. I haven't dropped the iPod, but it is certainly well-protected, and, though it doesn't look quite as pretty in the case, the design of the iPod still shows through, and, what's best--my iPod still looks as good as new--unlike skins and other cases, the Showcase won't scratch or dent your iPod in any way. I'm very happy with my purchase",0
4784,Great TV. We specifically bought based on Consumer Reports rating and it is everything CR said it was,0
4785,"The best Surge Protector I've Ever bought. It is worth the $$$$. I hooked up all my electronics to it. The plugs are held extremely tight, and they will not fall out. The picture on my Monitor is less shaky. Also, the cord on it is extremely long, and the plug is almost flat to the wall. It is also a great deal because it comes with labels for the wires, and locking cable ties. I have bought one for my PC, and TV",0
4786,"RAM DVDs are great -- on suitable players!!!. After only a limited exposure on a new Panasonic DVD recorder, I am a fan of the DVD RAM format.  While I haven't had time to test the stated 100,000 time rewriting capability (and probably won't in my lifetime) I do appreciate the continuous editing capability, including the ability to create and title chapters after the initial recording.  I can see why this is now the prefered format in Japan, and why it is so pervasive in Europe.  I can only hope that it will catch on here. Until it does, be aware that there are only a few newer DVD players--and precious few PCs--that can read this format.",0

4792,Its an Inkjet cartridge- high capacity. I always buy this size because it lasts so much longer and sometimes you can find it for the same price as the normal capacity.

4793,"These Earphones are Brilliant!. I've gone back and re-ripped all of my songs at 192kps to take full advantage of what these earphones have to offer. I'm going to qualify my post by saying that I listen almost exclusively to an iRiver Clix. Which player you have is IMPORTANT. They each have a unique sound built in. My player has a graphic equalizer, so I am not stuck with factory presets. I'll tell you a little about my odyssey. I bought a Clix and a U10 in December. I am a person of small stature and have very small ear canals, so the earphones that came with the Clix just simply did not fit. So I bought the Sennheiser CX300's. After a day, I noticed that I could not hear the mid or high ranges. I went to Cnet reviews and realized that the V-Moda Bass Frequencies were an editor's choice. They were an improvement over the Sennheiser's, but like the Cnet editors said, They are for bass craving listeners--mostly those who own SanDisks' and Creative products because those products do not have equalizers. Since I could boost the bass on my player, I really did not need added bass. What I found out is that I am an audiophile. I want balanced, rich sound from my earphones. I first bought the Shure E2cs, and then finally the E4gs. I bought the E4gs because the cord is shorter than that of the E4cs. The sound is brilliant--beautiful tenor saxes and lead guitars. Excellent, deep bass. The music I listen to ranges from 1930's blues, 40's-50's rock on up and down the spectrum. Do not expect them to be as bassy as the Sennheiser's or V-Moda's. Those earphones emphasize bass. The emphasis of these headphones is BALANCED sound. Also, Shure's earphones typically requires a 20 hour break-in",0
4794,"Great standard mouse. Very responsive, nice feel, I bought this one to replace an older Kensington optical mouse and I still use the older one on another computer. Built to last",0
4795,"Great TV, had it 2 yrs and still runs great. Ive had this TV for 2 yrs now. Im a college student and bought it coz it was very reasonably priced (Id compared many prices at the time), and also it was a good size. 19"" is big enough for home use, and certainly big enough for a dorm room. Its a simple tv, and has audio, video, and earphone jacks. The picture quality is good. The tv has given me no problems at all in these 2 yrs. Its been subject to rough use, such as regular shifting from one dorm to another every semester, and having friends come over and use it too and it is still running fine.  Also its easy to use, menu systems navigable easily with remote control. So overall I think it is a great product, and I am very glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a low cost but good quality tv",0
4796,"Good little receiver. I have several shortwave radios, but this has become the one I use the most because of it's small size, generally good performance and ease of use. To be sure, there are better receivers out there that cost more, but for $30 this little gem offers a lot of value for the money. Sensitivity and selectivity are good, audio quality is better than what you'd expect from its tiny speaker and the digital display makes it easy to find radio stations. All in all it's a neat little package",0
4797,"Quick and easy setup. My customer was looking for a universal docking station to allow for usage with multiple laptops. This was the second universal docking station I tried. The first was connected through the PCMCIA slot. After several attempts to get it working, I resolved to research the manufacturer website only to find that the laptops were not listed as being compatible. So much for 'universal.'The Targus ACP50US connects to the laptop via USB allowing for a quick and easy disconnect. The feature highly favored is the ability to quickly change the display. At the click of a button, the primary display can be either the laptop or an attached monitor. The display can be extended across both monitors or mirrored. When the docking station is disconnected, the display is set to the laptop. When the docking station is reconnected, the display automatically returns to the last setting.Overall, the Targus ACP50US is a great product",0
4798,"Definately Worth Buying. Before buying this antenna, I relied on a small, amplified indoor antenna above my TV.  I live in a rural area about 2-15 miles from the broadcast towers in the Baton Rouge area.  I would often have to move the antenna to pick up different stations.  The combination of a metal roof, chimney, and large trees were hampering my reception.Upon receiving the Terk HDTV, I hooked it up next to my indoor antenna.  The signal strength went from half to full strength.  I did not have to move the antenna to pick up all of the stations and my ice-maker and other electronic devices no longer interfered with the reception.I am so impressed with the difference that I am no longer planning to mount it to my chimney and instead will mount it in my attic to protect it from the elements",0

4812,"Great Screen Protector, Not so easy to install, though. This is a very helpfull screen protector... it really protects the screen from glares and scratches. Its pretty simple, but I had some problems installing it to my Dell Axim x51, since the screen protector is much more bigger than the screen, so you must ""force"" it in order to make it perfectly fit, or you could also try to cut the screen protector so it could fit without having to use the ""brute force"".It does it work, though, for such a cheap price, but sorry I can't give it a 5 stars, since the installation could be a little bit hard because of its size... which could cause the glue it has to get lost and leave bubbles on the corners of the screen, which happened to mine",0
4813,"very easy to use. this printer is great- its easy to use, there is really no need for a manual, prints pictures quickly and the color is excellent.  i love how you can put a jumpdrive or a memory card to it and it will show all of the pictures. you can rotate the pictures, delete them off of your memory card as you go, on the printer, you can turn the pictures black and white, sepia, antique, ect.  you can change the brightness from the printer, crop it... all in all, excellent! i'd reccommend this to anyone :",0
4814,"Good Purchase. Everything works well - I bought this as I needed this as I work with Excel alot and needed the convenience of having a num pad. It works as expected, I just wish the numb pab wasn't so big, also I wish this came without the extra buttons on the num pad - buttons which can be used to load a program or control the volume/mute your speakers. Its a good added feature but can be an added inconvenience at times. Another con - the screen is a little hard to see as I am always leaning over and tilting it to properly read the LCD. Other than that I would say its a great purchase. A+",0
4815,"Good, reliable, and inexpensive. I've had this hub for two months and have had no problems with it. Installation was a snap, as it should be for a basic hub. The hub is small and a bit too light, but it's definitely not for laptop users, as it needs an AC adapter.  The power brick is actually smaller than most other brick-style adapters and rises straight up from the prongs, saving you space on power strips that have the plugs aligned vertically or on wall outlets (a nice touch). I have an iPod and a multifunction printer attached to the hub, and have had no problems with either.  A word of warning, however--as other reviewers have noted, if you plug a USB 1.0 device into the hub, all USB 2.0 devices will slow down to 1.0 speeds",0

4830,"Very sleek, easy to use, quality throughout. This player is a great value.  It may not be flashy with a nice color screen, but the display it provides is very informative and easy to view.  The features are fantastic, it does a great job of organizing your music by file name or ID tag it would seem.  I automatically breaks it down by artist, or you can make your own playlists.  I use mine in the car for XM and mp3 playback to my car radio, then wear it on my belt while walking into work, then listen to it at my desk with the included home kit.  Transfer is quick from PC to unit.  Only concerns are that you only get 1/2 GB for mp3s and 1/2 GB for XM recording, there is no way to change this to a greater portion for mp3s, I would avoid the Nexus 25, I couldn't imagine much use for only 250 MB of mp3 storage space.  Also, the remote is a bit weak as far as strength of signal, but how far can you get from the player in your car?  Not a bug issue.  The extra $ makes this unit worth it over the Nexus 25.

After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model.

4836,"The ""almost"" perfect GPS-- Garmin GPS 276C. First, I purchased my 276c in September of 04 which means I've been using about 3 months. It was purchased to replace my Garmin GPSIII that I had used for around 6 years.  The GPSIII still works great but has no detail maps available and no turn by turn directions, but for basic Lat/Long it still works perfect.I compared the 276C to the Garmin Quest, Magellan RoadMate 700, and the Garmin Street Pilot Series.I wanted it to be portable. Meaning I could use it in the car, boat, or walking/hiking.  Basically I wanted to be able to use it just about anywhere, just like I used my GPSIII.  This quickly narrowed my search down to the 276C and the quest.  The others mentioned above are strictly automotive GPS units.  Besides size, I couldn't find anything the quest had over the 276C.  The 276C certainly is bigger but I liked the additional Screen Real-estate.The 276C purchased with the automotive adapter does everything I want and it does it well.  However, I have 3 complaints that keep it from getting a perfect score in my book.These are not really in any particular order of importance.#1 Proprietary Memory Stick that Only go up to 256MBThis Memory Stick holds all of the map data that helps you find addresses and specific sites.  The one that comes with the automotive kit is only 128MB.  You can't just go get another one of these anywhere because it is a proprietary design.  The 128MB one I have had enough storage to download all the map data between Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada.  We drove to Vegas from Austin in November and the 276C worked great.  I wish it wasn't a proprietary design or I wish they at least offered a larger model that would hold the entire US.#2 Cheap, Cheap, Cheap Car adapter.  I read this on another review site before I bought mine. And they were right.  The threading that holds the fuse in place is plastic. Pulling the unit out of the car power plug puts stress on the threads.  Mine broke last week but was quickly replaced by an authorized Garmin dealer.  This is another item you can't just buy anywhere because the car adapter has the built in speaker.  I don't expect the new adapter to last long either.  I move mine between cars several times a week.#3 File this one under being very picky.If the address of your destination is on a one way street the 276C will try to route you around the block so that you can come back down the one way street.  This is fine except when the location is really on the corner of a one way street with an entrance on the side street.  The unit will literally route you right past the side entrance to the next street that will allow you to go up a few blocks so that you can come right back down to the location on the one way street.   I don't know if the automotive only GPS units would handle this situation any better.That's it.We drove over 3000 miles on our trip in November and used the 276C extensively the whole way.Regards,Alan",0

The 2.5 inches refers to the main chamer that holds the laptop. When you add the outer pockets, it bulks up. However, it is still a very nice, sleek looking bag and I am planning on keeping it.

4843,"Great little remote. When my Toshiba VCR remote starting giving me problems, I decided to look into a Universal replacement.  I don't care for their usual bulkiness, so this one stood out because of its slim-line design.  The reviews were positive and the price unbelievably low, so I took a chance.It's even nicer than I'd hoped.  It is slim, so it handles easily; it's light, and the buttons are well placed.  Its programmability and learning capability allow it to do about anything that your other remotes are capable of, and you can pretty much place these functions on whatever keys you wish (read the instructions first--it's easy.  I believe that the reviewer who complained that the unit was only controlling a limited number of functions had not fully read the instructions and utilized the programming/learning capability.  I'm impressed at what it can do, which includes everything on my VCR remote).  The keys are reusable between devices; that is, a key that's set up for a particular function on one device is totally free for a new setting when you switch to another device mode.  It isn't backlit, which is not a particular problem for me, but might be a feature someone else needs.I bought a second one.  I purchased the ""6 Device"", and then bought the ""8"" as the second, and I can tell you that the only difference between them is the two additional device controls---there are no other added functions on the ""8"" --- but, it didn't need any (Well, maybe that backlighting thing).I haven't had it long, so I can't speak to durability, although I have dropped it on a couple of occasions and it was unfazed.  It actually seems very sturdy.  I guess I'm trying to figure out why such a low-priced remote is so nice.  I can't.If you're looking for a simple, but effective, Universal remote, or just a replacement or an extra one, you won't be disappointed with this purchase.",0

Finally put a 35Lb barbell in front of it.The biggest con has not to do with the TV but the dearth of HD content. Others' comments about broadcast TV looking horrible on HD sets cannot be overemphasized. Same for DVDs on SD DVD players. On the latter note, buy a good upcoverting DVD player (&lt;$150); the visual results were simply outstanding.Also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum, HDMI preferred; Using S-Video or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the TV. So the other 'con' is that you will probably need a new A/V receiver and cables.So to recap, if you want a good experience, you need an HD TV, upconverting DVD player, A/V receiver with component or better yet HDMI connections, and HD broadcast content (cable or satellite). This is not a cheap endeavor",0
4845,"Father's Day Present. My husband told me he would like a Sony RM-AX4000 HomeTheater Remote Control for Father's Day. As Father's Dayapproached, I realized I couldn't remember what it washe'd asked for, so I asked him again.  I was nearly out oftime to locate this product, but I checked Amazon.com andthey had them listed.  I ordered one and had it shippedquickly, but I didn't think it would be in time for him toopen on Father's Day.  The package arrived on Saturday, theday before Father's Day, and Amazon saved the day for me.Thank you Amazon, for all that you do!Kathryn Santos-Ree",0
4846,"Very pleased. First of all, I can't believe I actually replaced my cd drive, but my brother said I could do it. I've made lots of cds with the new Sony drive and it works great -- no problems at all",0
4847,"Great Replacement for Linksys 4-port model. I bought this for a small office LAN which was using a 4-port Linksys router.  I considered wireless for them, but since it is a dentist office, I feared that X-ray and other related machines would interfere.  The setup was very easy, especially since the PCs were already talking to a router.  I also took the liberty of setting up STATIC addresses, and turning off DHCP on the router; seems to make things faster, especially when booting workstations.Overall, Linksys products have not disappointed me, and this was no exception",0
4848,"You get what you pay for. I originally bought this CD case for my car, because I listen to CDs the most while driving.  This was not a good case to bring back and forth at all.  It is very large and heavy (even without CDs!), and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand.  I now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games.  For what you pay, it is an excellent buy",0
4849,"Great for College Students. I purchased this item for my college bound boyfriend who is studying music.  He uses it to record himself on drums, then transfers it to the computer (MP3 files for his MP3 player as well!).  Discreet size make this a plus not to mention the digital aspect as well.  Overall, a great buy.  The price tends to fluctuate on Amazon (as do the quantities), therefore I suggest you nab it once the price is resonable.",0
4850,"A portable player with an endless library. Firstly, understand what this player is NOT. It is not a receiver that will allow you to receive Live XM broadcasts when you're out walking around. for that try the Samsung Helix.What it IS, however, is a very good portable player that also has the ability to record ANY XM channel for playback (the player must be docked to record). What this effectively does is allow you to have a near-endless library of songs or talk shows, etc. that you can play on your device.I love and have an iPod, but part of the problem is that I'm stuck listening to the songs that I have in my library. What the Nexus does is allow you to record various XM channels - then you can sort back through the songs and play the ones you like - very cool. You can still use it like an iPod as well and put music from your library onto the Nexus as well.As for the functionality of the device, it's small but has a good build quality and fairly easy to use (albeit not as intuitive as the Ipod). The screen is monochrome with a blue backlight.This unit also utilizes the XM Passport Mini-Tuner, which allows you to use one XM subscription on any Passport-ready hardware such as a factory-ready stereo unit, home tuner, etc. This is a big savings - perviously you had to purchase a new subscription for each separate XM device. Now with the Passport, you can have 1 subscription and simply take the small Passport chip with you and plug it in.Overall, a very useful device and certainly a very good buy for the money",0
4851,"Great Monster Cables @ Low Amazon Prices. I checked out these Ultra Series THX 800 HDMI Video cables at Infinity Electronics, and their low discounted price was $149.99 for exactly the same item (even the blue cable trim) in a blister pack.  I was converting from a high-end Samsung DVD/VCR Combo to a Panasonic ""75-Series"" combo with HDMI conversion uplink.  It was great to get rid of all the cable clutter, and replace 3-cables with one.  Can I say ""Wow?!!!  The performance of Panasonic and monster cable combination blew the doors off the old system.  What picture clarity, and even the sound might have been a smidgeon better.  Would I do this reconfiguration again?  You bet!  Next I'm upgrading my last generation Yamaha - 400 series receiver to an Onkyo 804S - from Amazon.  I'll also order the corresponding appropriate Monster 800 cable",0
4852,"awesome. I originally bought an Acoustic Research AW-811 wireless speaker but the unit wouldn't power up after using it a few times.  Then I bought the Music Sphere and it has been awesome.  The sound quality is better than the AW-811, and the build quality seems much better.  It's very stylish too.I'm using the speaker to listen to music in the kitchen playing from my computer upstairs.  For this purpose it works really well.  I haven't heard any static or interference.  I have an audo splitter on my computer so that I can hear music from the computer speaker and music sphere at the same time.  Some other wireless solutions (saitek A-250 and Logitech Wireless Music System for PC) don't allow you to do this.Another cool feature is that you can mute or adjust the volume using any remote (the speaker has a learning system).  If you opt to mount the speaker on the wall, this comes in very handy.Overall, I think this is the best solution for piping music from your computer or home stereo to another area of your house",0
4853,"Good value. I purchased this joystick and have about 10 to 15 hours in on it at the time of this review.  Overall it's a good stick.  I thought it was drifting at first but noticed that it was actually my hand that was ""resting"" wrong.  I took my hand off it it stoped the drift.  I've only had to calibrate the stick once so far.I like the stiffness of the stick, and it's uniform throughout the movement (ie not increasing/decreasing as you near the end of it's range).  The grip is a little small for me, and I don't have overly large hands (sorry ladies) so this might be a consideration if you have big hands.The front button above the trigger button presses a little awkwardly at first, but once you get used to it it's not too bad.  The three buttons on the base at the front of the stick are spaced so that you can have 1 finger on each of them without difficulty.I would like to see a pinky button on this stick, but didn't expect one since it wasn't in the picture.All in all it's a good stick, but I can't speak for the life-span, just the out-of-the-box performance",0
4854,"awesome battery booster. This product is, in my opinion, all that anyone could ever want in an iPod external battery.  When I go on long trips via airplane, I can watch video the whole way across the U.S. with this.  The iBoost also allows you to never remove your iPod from it again; you can charge and synchronize your iPod without removing it from the iBoost, just drop the whole package into the iPod Dock.  My iPod Video 5.0G 30GB is held snugly by the retention arms and the foam spacer pad.  The foam spacer pad is removable to fit larger iPods",0
4855,"I love the picture on the Samsung 26"" HDTV. The picture is phenomenal!  The TV fits easily in a small space, but has a good size picture even sitting 6 feet away.  The one drawback, which has not been an issue for me, but might be for people who use other digital equipment such as a video recorder, is that the jacks are only on the back of the TV.  Otherwise, it's a great product",0
4856,"Great product, excellent USB performance. This adapter gives us consistently excellent range and signal (at least 80%) anywhere in our 2700 sq ft two-story home.  The adapter also works with our older WRT54G router (which is not an SRX router), but the adapter gave us better performance than our other wireless G adapters already in the house which were hovering around 30-60% signal performance.  Its works great with our laptops and desktops alike",0

I am very impressed.  The green LED is awesome!  I own a lot of atomic clocks, and this is the first LED one I've seen besides the ... Sangean/Proton one.  This thing is solid, and it looks like it was made in the 60's or 70's when you had heavy, quality electronics in a tight package.  This is worth way more than the selling price",0

4861,"Excellent product that can be used both for business and art. I own several tablets and use them instead of the mouse. The addition of the JustWrite and Ever Notes software in the Graphire 4 version is an excellent addition. This software allows you to add your signature to Word documents as well as edit or make notes on a word document.Those who have problems with the pen generally didn't use the installation software that comes with the product. It is very user freindly and doesn't need a instruction book although one is available in the readmetxt. Once you install the pen the tablet area equals your monitor so  where ever you put the pen on the tablet is where the cursor is. You are also able to adjust the pen sensitivity.This, however  is very fine tuning with the advanced user or long time user in mind. That said  the pen settings can be easily changed so it won't hurt to try making minor adjustments until you find the setting you like. You can always reset the parameters back to default.",0

The card DOES SUPPORT WPA ENCRYPTION, just don't install or use the Belkin connection utility.  Only install the drivers then cancel and let XP handle the connection. You plug your encryption key back into windows network connection manager when you connect and you are good to go. Have used several newer and supposedly fast adapters and this one smokes them on speed and range. Belkins website says that they were out of stock due to popularity of the product so you would think that they would get the message, pump out more of these and upgrade their software to take advantage of the higher security encryption",0

It was worth the money to have this dependable and versatile bracket",0

4866,"HP Ipaq hx 2495. I had an entry level iPaq - the 1910 - for a couple of years.  Had lots of trouble with it (some of which I believe were created by an aftermarket synch/charging cable).  It finally died, and I replaced it with a Palm TX which I quickly returned.  Windows compatible - yes /work efficiently - no.I replaced that with the iPaq hx2495 and love it.  I would have given it 5 stars rather than 4, but I would need to have the unit function w/o problems for another few months before giving it the fifth star.I have it synched w/2 computers and had no problems loading or using the software.  ActivSynch 4.5 seems to be working w/o flaw.  The connections seem a little better built than my old 1910, and I have been able to use the wifi to access Internet Explorer and email w/o a problem either.Right now, I am very happy with this, but then it cost me $350.00, so it should make me happy!  I'd spend that again just to have something that works this efficiently and is powered by Microsoft rather than just Microsoft ""compatible"".  Spend the extra bucks - it's worth it",0

4869,"No magic, but a very good car GPS. I have read many customer reviews before buying this GPS. Now I see that many things mentioned by the reviewers differ from my personal experience. Here is what I have noticed so far:1. Maps: appear to be quite accurate. As of this writing, I did not experience any problems with the maps. I doubt that paper maps would be more accurate, or updated more frequently.2. Updates: I have recently downloaded and installed version 3.11, and had no problems during or after installation.3. Battery: not great, but quite reasonable. After all, it is a car GPS, so most of the time it will be plugged in anyway. If you need an AC adapter, I suggest buying an AC to 12V converter instead. (This is what I have). It is more universal and can be used to power other units (coolers, car phone chargers, etc.) from an AC outlet.4. Satellite reception and tracking: no complains here.5. Menus and other UI: nothing horrible. When you get used to it, it becomes comfortable.6. Music player, photo viewer: IMO absolutely useless. (Same as Bluetooth, which is NOT build into this unit, and some people complain). Do you really have no better way of playing your music or answering your phone calls? Then it's a pity. Honestly, I am not sure why did they even bother building all this functionality into a car GPS unit. Still, it works, and it is not true that you need proprietary software or a specially formatted SD cards for it. I used Windows explorer and a standard SD card to copy MP3 files from my laptop and play it on my GPS (no Magellan software).Summary: good GPS unit, especially for the price (I got mine for under $300). If you need a navigation computer, consider buying a GPS antenna for your laptop, and then carry it with you all the time :). For me, it is enough not to get lost in an unknown city, and finally get where I wanted to be. Plus, it is quite cool to know how far are you from the destination, and how long it will take you to get there, even if you know the route by heart",0

4872,"Quality discs with great colors. Memorex and other brands tend to be a bit less expensive, but I've found that the build quality of these Sony color minidiscs are better. And since they only are few cents more per disc, why not spend a little more for the quality? The colors allow you to color-code your collection, but you probably would have to buy these minidiscs in bulk for it to be worthwhile. I use these with my portable MD player which can record/transfer up to 6hrs of audio onto each minidisc. The included carrying case is handy and is small enough to fit in a coat pocket. My only complaint is that you probably wouldn't want to cover up these pretty little discs with the mundane labels Sony includes. There's a frosted finish on the face of these minidiscs so that you could write on it with a fine marker, but since many of the discs are dark, they would be hard to read",0
4873,Great Navigation. I bought this for my daughter for xmas. I researched many before desiding on this one. I think it does a great job navigating and has some cool features my daughter loves. Like being able to put pictures on it. Couldn't be happier with purchase and neither could my daughter,0

Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too.I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today",0
4877,"Extraordinary Overclocking Potential. This is not the fastest chip on the market by any measure, but it certainly holds its own against chips that cost four times as much money when it's overclocked.  Get a quality 500W+ PSU, an overclock friendly motherboard (I suggest the ASUS P5ND2 SLI), and some decent fast RAM (DDR2 667 or DDR2 800 should do the trick), and you can build yourself a very fast system without spending much money!If overclocking scares you, this chip is not going to provide smoking results in a gaming system compared to other chips in the price range, particularly in games.  You'll want to look at the high end of AMDs single-core budget range for that.  On the other hand, if you're looking to get the most performance you can for the money you spend, you can easily add 1 Ghz or more to the sticker speed without buying an expensive cooling system.This chip works particularly well for audio and video encoding, decoding, and production tasks.  The dual core is like having two CPUs on one chip, and it'll split the load particularly well when you're multi-tasking or running concurrent threads.  It's not so great at load balancing most current games, but the raw horsepower you get from the overclock will be more than enough to post high framerates, and future games might be better optimized for dual-core systems, soon.I should mention that this chip supports 64-bit operating systems, but many people using the 64-bit edition of Windows have experienced problems with low-level software and drivers.  I suggest you stick with a 32-bit operating system for now (i.e., Windows XP Home or Pro) and upgrade later, after manufacturers have had ample time to get their product lines supported.Bottom line: If you're willing to spend $400 or more for a small performance gain, there are faster speed-demons to be found.  However, if you're looking for the best bang for your buck, and you're not afraid to tweak the default clock settings, look no further.  This is it",0
4878,"Great speakers. If you are looking for decent speakers for a common home theater system, these are for you, I have had the Phoenix Gold speaker layout for over a year now and I have no complaints.  Unless you are going for a professional setup with sound barrier walls and $5000 components, this series of speakers is for you, you will spend a heck of alot more money for speakers of lesser quality or that are too good for your room.  Do not let the price tag scare you, YES you can have a quality speaker set up for under $300.  I have a 5.1 system on a Yamaha 980 watt receiver and I will put it on full blast with no hesitation and no distortion.  For the money you can not get a better product",0
4879,"Great upgrade over on-board sound. The last soundblaster I had used was a soundblaster Live a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been relying on onboard sound on Nforce based motherboards. Sound quality was okay, but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs. I decided to upgrade to the X-fi when I started to have sound dropouts while playing Oblivion.Sound quality from the X-Fi is great, especially with headphones. I'm only using the Drive bay I/O panel for the headphone jack, but the price of the Platinum version wasn't much more than just the basic card, so it was money well spent. If I had this set up as a media center PC, the remote control functions would make this an even better deal.A few notes:-I had no problems installing this on an NForce4 based motherboard (Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe)-The I/O drive bay only comes in black. If you still have a tan case you're out of luck-There is a digital SPDIF output available on the back of the card. It's a mini 1/8"" jack, and unfortunately no adapter to RCA jack is included",0
4880,"It works great, I love it!. At first I was worried about some of the negative reviews I've read about this product. Instead of listening to those reviews, I ignored them and I'm so glad I did. Not only that this product works great, it gave me a chance to have a extra external storage that I can carry around with me. The thumbs drives are awesome, but is limited to the capacity of the storage amount I would be needing in the type of work I do. With the Western Digital 60GB passport, I don't have to worry of needing an extra drive to save all my back-ups. It looks great too. I love it.",0
4881,"Fabulous TV, Fabulous Price. This 32"" LCD Aquos is quite possibly the best size/quality/price combination on the market. The picture is clearer than I could ever have hoped, better than the much more expensive (and heavy) plasma screens. Sharp has also managed to get as close to true black as is possible with LCD, and the colors are vivid and true. Setup couldn't be easier, and there are more inputs (6) than most people have devices to input. Importantly, there are two HDMI inputs so digital cable and DVD no longer have to make do with the analog losses from the previous gold standard component inputs. With HDMI, everything that's digital stays digital, all in one cable. Plus your video games can be hooked up to the two component (or two composite) inputs. As for the screen size, those tempted to go larger should remember two things: 1) the resolution on the 37"" screen is the same as on the 32"", resulting in a larger picture but one which is more pixelated; 2) the picture is so clear, you can view the screen quite clearly from a much farther distance than you would imagine. Combine all this with Sharp's Emmy-winning pixel technology and a refresh rate of only 6ms, as opposed to 8ms for most LCDs in this range--meaning virtually no lag even with the fastest action pics or sports events--and you have a TV with virtually no flaws. And the two 10W speakers are more than adequate until you get your optical Dolby surround system set up",0
4882,"Solid workhorse. We're using this to go from PC audio card to speakers for a small gym.  It works very well.  Simple.  Low price point.  Reliable.Lacks the bells and whistles of a surround sound system, but works great for basic stereo need",0
4883,"Recommended. A very nice case.  It will fit a video 80GB iPod (5th gen), despite the ""60"" in the name.  It is made of a durable plastic material that's easy to see through, and has rubber on the sides so it's easy to grip.It also has a nice sliding latch that wont accidentally come undone.  To try and describe it further since it's not well illustrated: it's a dual sliding latch on the same side that requires two fingers to lock / unlock (or one finger in two steps).  Picture your index finger and thumb meeting to unlock.  Reverse to unlock.The cons are the are very small crevices around the edges (the case kind of flips open like a book) and around the exposed headphone and sync ports  that a few dust particles can get it, though I'm not sure if that could have been prevented.And don't expect to dock your iPod while it dons this case.  While this case doesn't add a lot of bulk, it wont fit in to a typical dock.Overall I would recommend this case",0
4884,"very good small radio. This is a very good radio, well-built, acceptable reception by considering its size and price. The quality of the sound is great. It also shows time with alarm. It's sleep mode helps to save battery life. I strongly recommend this nice radio.",0

4886,"OUTSTANDING Razor. I have used Braun razors for years, but when my last one finally died, I bought a Panasonic.  What a mistake.  I took it back after trying it a week and bought this Braun Syncro.  I have a heavy beard with lots of swirling whisker directions on my neck and this is the only razor I have found that will give me a very clean shave.  When you buy it, give it a week for you and your beard to get used to it, and always shave ""against the grain"", even if you have to slide the razor sideways.I actually bought the one with the cleaner base, which I was very skeptical of.  It looked like just another gimmick to take more money out of your pocket.  It probably is, but I must say that it does an amazing job of cleaning and oiling the razor and it shaves like new after every cleaning.  They tell you to clean it after every use.  Now THAT is a marketing gimmick.  However, if you only do it once every couple of weeks, the liquid lasts for months and the razor stays like new (and smells good)  :).Great razor.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the price.",0
4887,"excellent receiver, exactly what I expected & more. I have just up-graded to a 40"" HD samsung 1080p TV so I had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 ""great receiver"" with this 674 model mainly for the HDMI switching capabilities, set-up was a little tricky but after an hour I was ready to try the audyssey set up mic. which was very straight forward & accurate Boy was I blown away. This thing has such clarity & separation I couldn't believe the difference over my older onk.rec.I have direct TV hd-dvr & Panasonic 1080i DVD player via HDMI through receiver, don't waste your money on those over priced monster cables, all of mine are 15-20 bucks from amazon. I am so pleased with my purchase I also feel this is a great value 599.00 I know their is not a better receiver out there at this price or even for 200.00 more. I would highly recommend this as the backbone to any quality home theater system. I read another review that expressed that you couldn't turn it up past 60,that is false I can crank mine up to max with with vertually no distortion",0
4888,"Value exceeds the price. Just recently purchased this from amazon, a few hiccups with the shipping but these things happen, and since the price online was great and the shipping was free it doesn't hurt to bad to overlook the mishap.It's hard to begin to praise the quality of sound and picture your going to get for the amount of money that you pay with this HTIB (home theater in box) system.  I am by far no expert but I have worked in the car audio industry for 5 years now and have a few friends with expensive surround systems so I know the difference between quality sound, decent sound and bad sound.  There is a noticable difference in quality between this and the high end stuff which is to be expected, but for the price your paying this sony system can't be beat.  The set up is a breeze and connecting everything is very easy.  The sound is crisp and clear.  I got my 42 LCD tv a few weeks before this and for a while I was watching movies off the Xbox360.  The picture was great but the sound really didn't add up.  This system has provided a sound level with a quality to equal the picture. There have been a few times when I have jumped up while loungin on the couch cause the sound was so real.  Also if your a gamer pick up an optical cable for the 360 and run it through this system it will broadcast games in 5.1 digital which will change your life. If your a gamer and have digital cable, you'll need to pick up a digital coaxial cable as well otherwise you'll have to switch the optical from the 360 to the cable if you want to watch cable in 5.1Picture wise DVDs look great, I can tell a noticable difference in quality with the upscaling vs watching a dvd on a reg. player.  Bear in mind it is not going to look like an HD DVD or a Blu Ray movie does but its pretty close and should satisfy most people.Now for addressing some of the critics out there.It does load really slow and it can be hard keeping track of discs.  My point is why would you have 5 dvds loaded in the first place you only watch one movie at a time, unless your marathoning the sopranos or a sergio leone movie night there is no need.  I've been keeping slots one and two open for dvd and leaving the other 3 for music which seems to divide things up and makes it more easy to keep track of things.The sub is way to loud.  I'm amazed that sony didn't put a control knob on the sub box, as my previous and cheaper phillips system as well as my computer speakers did. This is the reason why its not a five star system.  Contrary to other claims you can adjust the sub.  You have to go to the setup menu and customize the setup (this is after you do the auto cal.)The sound quality for music isn't the greatest, cds sound pretty good but if you hook a laptop up digital music volume is pretty low.When its all said and done, the quality you get for this system is well beyond the price tag.  It has a few kinks and doesn't sound like a ultra high end system, but you really don't need something like that in your house unless you have a huge home theater room anyway.  The styling of this system is retro and pretty cool the speakers look great, and the picture and sound are awesome",0

Ipods, in my opinion, are over rated and too expensive, especially if, like me, you would only use it less than an hour a day.  I know several people who have had so many problems with their Ipods.  I have had no trouble at all with the SanDisk.  It comes with an armband, and plastic protective case to prevent the screen from getting scratched.  Its a great little player if you can't afford the hype of an Ipod",0
4895,"Does a good job but does have a problem. I got mine on sale for about half-price so I have no complaints about the cost. It works very well and, for me at least, will even works indoors. The battery will work around four hours while listening to satellite broadcasts. I've not tried it just on FM. It's certainly not very heavy as some have claimed, at least in my opinion.The number one problem so far has been removing the Roady receiver after use. The fit is so tight that sometimes it takes all my strength to open the tray. However, I have discovered a solution to that. Get a very thin piece of metal, preferably very strong, such as a fingernail file. In the upper left-hand corner of the audio system the corner is curved. Very gently insert the piece of metal in this corner and very gently pry the radio to the right. You won't have to pry it very far either. So far I haven't damaged the receiver, so be sure and use a gentle touch. I've written Delphi and complained about this problem. They are aware of it, but haven't been able to figure a solution. They say the tight fit is required so the system will work properly",0

4897,"Very good device, some ""assembly"" required. This is my second Harmony (having owned the H688 previously), so I am already familiar with Logitech's (quite improvable) web programming system. It also is my third universal remote, so I have some experience in this regard (not all of them pleasant).First of all, the H1000 is a solid device, and it has a lot of nice touches that show that it's engineers have put their knowledge to good use. For example, the device self-activates as soon as you pick it up or move it about.The device itself looks really, really nice with it's rounded edges, brushed aluminum finish, and perfectly-placed real-button controls (if you are right-handed, which I am). It fits the palm of my hand nicely, combining just the right thickness and heft, placing the buttons naturally under my right thumb. The H1000 combines a color active-matrix LCD with is touch-sensitive (for programmable virtual buttons), and an array of real buttons along the right edge. Using the remote comes natural, with your thumb seeking out the buttons, and using the left index finger for the virtual buttons.The Harmony works by assigning 'activities' that know which devices are required, turning them on, and unneeded devices off when switching to an activity. It remembers which devices are on/off from the current activity. For example, when I switch from 'Listen to music' to 'Watch DVD', the Harmoniy gives the commands to- stop playing in iTunes to my Mac mini- turn on the DVD player- switch to 'DVD in' on the Amplifier- turn on the TV, and switch to SCART2To use this functionality you have to set up the remote first, and this is the step that most people find frustrating. Logitech provides a web interface which works, but is far from user-friendly. The database of supported devices is surprisingly large and complete, and if you can't find your device, the remote can 'learn' the relevant commands from your original remote (provided you still have it). Unfortunately, programming the remote is cumbersome, and involves many program-upload-test cycles that take a *lot* of time. Once set up, the remote works well. Provided, of course, you thought of the many times where you need more than the basic functionality, and have programmed it.The biggets problem many people may face with the remote (and this may be the reason for so many drastically diverging ratings) is that your enjoyment greatly depends on your ability to find a good button layout for your specific needs. Thus, you can either end up with the perfect remote, or a borderline usable device. Few people, however, are prepared to invest the time required to get the Harmony to a level that is really good. In this regard I would like to see Logitech to provide templates for more intelligent layout design.A nice surprise to me was the H1000's ability to re-use most of my H688's programming, cutting down my time to program it a lot. Also, contrary to many reports, the software can be used on a Mac - at least on an (older) PPC-based one. One strange choice was that Logitech chose to implement the USB adapter as a network connector (instead of a peripheral), which can cause problems. I did not encounter any crashing bugs during my set-up phase.As with most touchscreen-based remotes (this is my second remote of that kind, the other one being the venerable Sony Commander), it has the problem that you have to actually look down onto the remote while using it, and then glance back at the TV to see if the command was successfully received. Most people are used to 'feel' their way around a remote and can find the correct button blindly. While this was a big problem on my previous touch-screen remote, Logitech has added the most important buttons next to the touch screen, enabling similar behaviour (provided that you set up the remote that way). If your set-up is smart in that regard, you can use the Harmony blind for most of your needs.An annoying quirk (which I hope I can resolve soon) is that when you place the remote into the provided loading cradle (*nice*), it (falsely) assumes that you are done with all your activities, and commands all devices to power down.Also, the H1000 appears somewhat sluggishly in responding to some commands. While this is less of an issue when giving a 'play' command to the DVD player, it makes volume control somewhat more difficult than it needs to be.Other than that, I can wholeheartedly recommend this device to people, but must caution them that they should only invest in this device if they are prepared to invest the time required to fine-tune it. And the *will* take a few hous",0

4909,"Quiet, Simple, Effective. A friend loaned me her Whirlpool for a month before I decided to purchase this one. The Whirlpool unit was very loud and soured my already-skeptical spouse on the notion of dehumidifiers.Despite her reservations, I purchased the Soleus unit. She told me a few days after it arrived that she approved of it. One advantage of this unit is that, unlike the Whirlpool unit, the fins of the heating and cooling coils are protected by the air filter and cannot be easily bent or damaged. I've had no difficulty removing and emptying the bucket full of water. It is incredibly quiet, as compared to the Whirlpool unit. It is also quite portable, though the handle is too low to the ground for the wheels to be useful. A telescoping handle like most airline baggage would have made it easier to transport from room to room. It takes approximately a day for the reservoir to fill up in my house, which has a typical relative humidity in the range of 50-65%. I've found that the unit works well for removing the humidity in one room, but due to a lack of air circulation in my home, must be moved from room to room to dry out the whole house. The air intake is in the back, so I often face the unit backwards in an attempt to promote more air flow through the unit. My spouse was concerned about the energy consumption of this unit, but it is roughly half of other 40-pint units - approximately 330 W. If you combine this with the quiet operation, compact size, and tolerable aesthetics, this unit is tough to beat. I would purchase it again.One odd thing occurred with the shipping. When the unit arrived, there were roughly a dozen wood screws embedded in the cardboard box underneath the shipping straps. Fortunately, none of them damaged the unit so I didn't complain to Amazon, but it was a strange occurrence.",0

I carefully slid the nano inside the case.I did not get any scratches on the ipod.I was afraid the nano would fall out since there is nothing strapped along the bottom.  However, the rubber pads inside hold the nano very snuggly.  I even held the case by the clip and shook it, yet the nano did not even budge a millimeter.I also like that the clip is removeable.I use the Bose iPod speaker dock with this nano.

4915,"Works Fine For My Needs. I was concerned about the mixed reviews of this product, but considering this scanner was so inexpensive I decided to try it myself.  An instruction manual and quick start guide is included, but for more thorough instructions check the Documentation folder on the CD.  After following the directions, I could not get the device to communicate with my computer.  The documentation and website advise trying to change the Baud Rate on the device and on the PC, but that still didn't help.  I finally got the connection to work after changing the COM Port number in the Advanced settings in Device Manager. For some reason the device is not a normal USB device, but can be found under Ports(Com&LPT) - Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port on Windows XP.Anyway, I now use the device to highlight key passages in my everyday reading, which are typically only one or two sentences long at a time and from both magazines and books.  I have good success with this device, but have not tried the optional image scanner or the infrared capability.  I have no experience with any other pen scanner, but this is the most inexpensive one I found and includes USB connectivity and works great for casual highlighting.  Once you get the connection working, and beyond the fact that this device is an ugly red, this is a good product to have.  The only issue I have with it now is that I wish it was a little smaller, especially since I don't have the need for the big display to see what I just scanned",0

From the moment I bought my MacBook, I was looking for a case that would protect my macbook without sacrificing it's look. The very reason many people buy a mac is for it's beautiful design and who in the world would want to spoil that look and how would you actually do that without hurting it by day to day use? Voila!

It covers the macbook completely at the top and at the bottom with openings on the sides for the different ports. There are fin like openings on the bottom case for heat to dissipate. That way you wouldn't have to worry about the macbook overheating.The only thing bothers me with this product is that once you put it in on your mac, it is difficult to remove it.

My first case was the Agent 17 (or is it 18?) for the Ipod photo, which I ""thought"" I liked alot until I opened the case and found the Ipod screen all scratched.Since I bought the video Ipod, I have gone through at least 3 cases, read extensive reviews on at least a half dozen. What convinced me to buy this were these: (1) It is currently the top rated at the Apple store , (2) The myriad of color options , (3) It is Belkin, which is a very respectable company, and one of the first to jump on the wagon for Ipod accessories since its revolution.I am glad I bought it, even though most reviews hint on the natural scratching of the outer case. Well, I don't really care as long as the Ipod itself is protected. That's the reason why I bought it in the first place.The case comes ready for both 30GB and 80GB sizes (they supply an extra bigger back case for the 80GB, which is what i have). The case fits perfectly, and even protects the wheel (an option not available in most cases), and there are gaps for every single outlet (hold, earphones, and dock) so that you needn't take the Ipod out unless necessary. The color is awesome, which is tempting me to go ahead and buy another case to switch  between the two. And it being sold via J&R is a huge plus. Their shipping time is excellent.

4933,"LOVE it!  Fast, quiet, does it all!. This is definitely the best laser AIO machine that I've ever used.  It is quick, robust, feature-rich, and networkable. Let me break it up to the different areas and give you my impression of each:Printer - From the printer's sleep mode to the time first page is printed is only around 4 seconds, which is just simply amazing. One small thing to complain about the printing aspect is the print driver. I have a couple other computers on my network that I want to set up to be able to print to this printer, but won't need the scanning feature. Well, the software that came with the printer is 250mb! The ""minimum"" installation is still 150mb. I figured there had to be a ""driver only"" option. After talking to HP, they showed me a 10mb executable that installs a wizard onto your computer to help you set up the network printer. After it is done setting it up, I can safely uninstall the wizard. They really should have included this wizard along with the installation disk, so minus 1/2 a star for that.Copier - This copier has all the features of an office copier, like auto document feed, priority paper feed tray, enlargement/reduction, dark/light, and of course number of pages. The ADF feature is awesome and fast, as it can quickly scan all your pages into memory before printing.  One down side (same ""problem"" as the scanner feature) is that it takes a few seconds for the bulb to warm up (about 20 seconds).  Once the bulb is warmed up, it can continue without any delay.  I wish this part is faster, but it's understandable, so no star deduction here.Scanner - Works great.  You can set it up so that by pressing the ""Scan to"" button on the scanner, it will automatically scan and optionally bring up the scanner program on your computer, which will allow you to do many things, such as cropping, adjusting color/saturation, resolution, and many others.  The bad part about this is that it takes a bit of playing around before I can find the option of bringing up this program.  By default, the scanner will only scan and allow you to save the results to a file or send in an email.  However, I discovered you can add a new target, and that can give you the option to bring up the scanner program.Of course this printer has no fax.  However, aside from that, it is the identical printer as the one with fax (3055).  That printer is highly praised as well.One more thing I like about this printer... actually, this is so for all HP and Canon printers.  The printer cartridge contains both the toner as well as the drum.  When you replace the one cartridge, you are replacing both units.  If you buy non-OEM cartridges, the price is only around thirty-something.  With other brands, you will need to change the toner when it runs out and then change the drum separately roughly around ever three toner changes.  The price of this can certainly add up, as it is an additional component.  Traditionally, drums are fairly expensive, so be sure to calculate that cost when trying to decide between brands.  As for me, I think I have found a winner.  Very happy",0

I got these for rear speakers over the stadium seating in the basement home theater, but you still want a little base out of them, so you have to box in  a cavity with 2x4's in order to get enough lower frequency response.  Mids and highs are fine, the cutting template was spot on, and the installation was a breeze.  Also consider their rectangular speakers - a bit more punch, if you have the space",0

4936,HP 4890 Scanjet. I purchased the HP 4890 for a project I was starting archiving approximately 2000 35 mm transparencies. The resolution of scanner is exceptional and the archiving of the slides has resulted in a product that was better than the original slides. I am now using it for general scanning. It is easy to use and the interface with my iMac is flawless,0
4937,1 GB card. I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology.  I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos.  I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow.  Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy.  Hope this is some hel,0

4941,"Best DVD/CD repair system. I was skeptical when I first purchased this repair machine as I considered it expensive, but I bought it for business purposes. I had previously bought a cheap DVD repair device that actually made my DVDs worse. I usually watch DVDs on my PC and unfortunately my PC's DVD drive is very sensitive to scratches. I used the Simotech repair unit on the worst of my DVDs. After performing the scratch repair and polishing, which was very easy and quick - the DVD not only worked perfectly - the surface looked brand new. I tested on several other DVDs and again it brought them back to like new condition",0

4947,"Good for the money. I have had this for about a month now.  I must say, for the price it isn't that bad.  It has a lot of settings that you would need to constantly play with because of all the choices and some spl setting you might want to set for some movies, regular channels etc..All in all it does the job.",0
4948,"Works!. Bought it.  Looks to be very high quality.  Lower price than Canon's.  All camera should have a uv filter to protect the lens.  This is a MUST!  I take lots of pictures near the ocean so salt spray will end up on the camera's lens.  You should avoid cleaning the camera's lens as much as possible to prevent lens scratches.  Clean only the filter.  You can also hold on to the housing as sort of an handle when moving about.Cons:  except for telephoto, adapter blocks the flash on bottom right portion of picture.  If sunlight should get into the adapter, you could end up seeing the metal part of the camera's lens reflected off of the filter on your pictures.  Maybe a lens hood would help... but they don't make one for this adapter.  Maybe painting the adapter black on the inside would help reduce flare.Amazingly good quality for the price.  All cameras should have provisions for installing a lens filter.  It's a crime that almost no camera manufacturer do this.  Guess they want you to replace the camera rather than the filter",0

Still a lot of ink charging and jyrating before I get a page. The color seems to be good but not that much more remarkable than the old slow Epson. No off market ink cartridges for this model so far which makes it $$$$ to operate. Next printer I'll check the ink situation before buying,0
4952,"A wonderful view that you can monitor. A real nice large, clear, crisp monitor right out of the box.  Colors are rich and true, unlike some I've owned.  Price is very reasonable now too for something this large and good.  Seems to refresh very quickly which is good in some of the games that you can play and watch on this. Sorry I can't get into the specs game about this monitor, and thanks to other reviewers for giving that info for those that need it, but it's just these here eyes that pass along their message that this was a good buy. That's my ultimate test.As I've said before, I have no financial or employment interest in the manufacturer or anyone else involved in anything I rate. I just rate the product without hidden (or unhidden) motives. While nothing to do with any of the other reviewers on this product, maybe sometime I can standardize the wording of this disclaimer to ensure others that there's no conflict of interest in what I say, and then get everyone to add a similar disclosure to their reviews when that's true for them. Maybe.  Anyway, this is a good unit at a good price and I'm happy with it.",0
4953,"buy it now. I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  This is a fantastic TV.  great picture, superior color and more brightness than i will ever use.  I've had this TV for 5 months and have not regretted one day.  Pair this with a directv or dish system and you will see things in regular and hi-def broadcasts that you've never seen before.Better yet, a nice HD-DVD or bluray player or at least an upcoding dvd player will make your movie experience like no other.  If you have the space and like the ""movie theater"" effect, then this is the TV for you.FWIW- I could see the 'rainbow effect' on older generation DLP tvs but i have not seen it yet on this tv.If you have a tiny room or need to hang your tv on a wall then get a plasma or LCD, otherwise GO BIG",0
4954,"Very happy. After having a Harmon Kardon receiver for almost 20 years that died a graceful death, my purchase before this TEAC was only about 2 years ago  (big mistake was the latest purchase - a ""refurbished"" product from another vendor. Within 2 years it had a significant background hum). I really like this TEAC unit for several reasons. I have never had a receiver with a remote, and it is nice to not have to keep opening and closing the audio center doors to operate it. More importantly to me is the fact that I have seen very few audio receivers that support a turntable, and I have a great collection of old vinyl - sometimes I like to reminisce! For those interested, my needs are for more background music, so I can't comment on how it sounds amped up full tilt, but overall, I think this was a great value and suits my needs just fine",0

4959,"Wonderful pocket radio. A small, no frills, conservatively styled, functional, and sturdy pocket radio of high quality. Good reception and sound, about as good as my portable (and expensive) Grundig AM/FM shortwave with digital tuner. Tuning is a little difficult if used in an area with a crowded bandwidth. My wife takes it around the house during daytime listening. Gets long ""mileage"" from  batteries. The external FM antenna is easily replaced if broken by removing a screw on the back cover. Nice feature. I've never been disappointed with a product from Panasonic. Can't say the same for the other guys like Sony. Real value considering the price. I don't believe there's a comparable product on the market at this price. For instance, the Sony pocket radio doesn't include the 1610-1710 AM width that began in 1993. At this price buy several for family and friends.",0

After forty burns or so, the failure rate's about one in twelve, no worse than with other media I use. I'm satisfied enough with these discs that I've already ordered another spindle",0
4963,"Good news and bad news. The color ink in these cartridges seems excellent to me, a  non-specialist in colored ink. The good news is that you only replace just the ink color that runs out in your Epson printer, avoiding the need to throw away unused ink in single cartridges that hold 3 colors, and maybe even black, too.  It is also very easy to replace cartridges.The bad news is that, in Epson (and other) printers, you can't print even just black text if any one of these colors runs out.  So you are forced to keep supplies of all four colors installed in your Epson printer at all times if you want to use it at all, even if you have no prospect of printing in color in the near future.These little cartridges are expensive, and it is obvious that Epson is making its profits on ink cartridges and not on the cheap printers most people use. The whole system is inherently unfriendly to the environment, as there is such a lot of waste in disposing of these complex little electronic cartridges once the ink is gone from them.The obvious thing to do would be for Epson to sell just replacement ink to pour in to recepticles for each color when they are empty or nearly so.  Some environmentally friendly way of keeping the ink channels unclogged would be needed then, but hey, they'd still make a lot of money selling ink and ink channel cleaner.  Is this rocket science",0
4964,"Great for notebook computer. It is very small, but comfortable to use.  I don't have really big hands so I don't know how a man would feel.  I hate the touch mouse on the notebook computer so this is great for me, it helps me do things much faster",0

It's bad enough taht they're bad for the environment, they also don't work as well as the price tag says they should.  Thank goodness for this attachment set!All hype aside, this product works exactly as the makers claim.  Use the power of your vacuum to get all the crap out of your keyboard, CPU, stereo and anywhere else.  I particularly like the brushes.I've also found that the dust I'm after is stubborn.  You really do need the full power of a vacuum to get at it.  So forget those handheld deals that hook into your USB port or whatever.  This product is cheaper than a lot of them and works better than all of them",0

4972,"Noise factor = trivial. I don't know what the fuss is all about about this unit's ""fan noise""... After the firmware update, if one bothers to do o it, the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of HUGE storage space (or data redundancy if one should choose to use RAID 1). The sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a PC workstation (one of those DELL Precisions or MacPro/PowerMacs).One of the things I wish could be different about the unit is if the RAID configuration could be more easily managed by using Apple's Disk Utility instead of using WD's own proprietary software (which requires a reboot... an annoying thing on Mac OSX.4 which I almost NEVER EVER have to reboot). And then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized... HELLO, Western Digital... Mac is no Microsoft Windows where users are used to rebooting often! If you want more of Mac users' business, write your apps like a true OSX app...

There are also no compatibility problems.To be fair to the Sandisk, it's an older model I purchased a few years ago for a MP3 player, however I now use it only as a backup to the Lexar.I plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future",0

This unit's heft shows heritage of design along the lines of expensive car deluxe CD players. Size is perfect and sits inconspicuously on my small bookcase. The fluorescent display is great,no way it could be improved.  The player loads and plays the disk automatically.Slick. The remote is a coup d'etat of just the right size and easy to read symbols. Important, else you would be hard pressed to see and fumble for the function keys on the unit if you are not eagle eyed.(This is an industry design thing that aint never going to go way) Summary: I think Tivoli put their money and value in this one. And recommend it,even if you don't use it w the Tivoli radio. The 12 Volt option is one I may explore. That would mean getting a back seat amp to the rear of my VW wagen. But it remains possible,so that is a design plus for this company. Hats off to Tivoli, my garden spot for small discrete audio gear...with minimum of glitz and faddishness. G",0

All devices that will communicate together areconfigured by the user to use the same network identifier.Special Notes:When comparing bps and Bps, there are some general rules of thumb.In wired LAN environments, rule of thumb is 10 bits per byte, resulting in a 10:1 ratio between bps (bits-per-second) and Bps (bytes-per-second).In wireless LAN environments, rule of thumb is 20 bits per byte (extra framing overhead, encryption), resulting in a 20:1 ratio.Though not exact, you may find these values useful in comparing products.In both wired and wireless cases, manufacturers quote highest rate possible at the lowest communications level.Test Results:XE103Netgear Utility displayed rate between XE103 devices = 42 MbpsBandwidth Monitor displayed rate = 1.2 MBpsTransfer time = 372 seconds = 1,062,177 Bps802.11BDevice setup utility displayed maximum signal and rate = 11 MbpsBandwidth Monitor displayed rate = 462 KBpsTransfer time = 985 seconds = 401,147 BpsTest Analysis:The XE103 performed 2.65 faster over the 802.11B in a timed comparison.Product Opinion:I have noticed that the Netgear Utility shows flunctuating rate values during different time periods.  The lowest rate has been 18 Mbps, highest 45 Mbps.The XE103 is at a premium price when compared with other powerline models.If similar test data can be found, it may be more cost effective to use a less expensive model (manufacturer quoted as 14 Mbps).If Internet surfing is main desire for the remote computer, then comparison of ISP provider rate to these tests results should be done.For highest security and speed, nothing will surpass a wired network.Powerline and wireless are a great convenience.Judge which is best by comparing your needs and desires for speed andsecurity.I hope that this helps in your research.",0
4986,Pleased. I looked for about a month and a half looking for the best flat screen moniter at a reasonable price. I looked various places online and at box stores. I found this with the rebate to be a great deal!! This included looking at various reviews and prior customer comments. I am extremely pleased with the performance it has provided. I started by looking at regular flat screen monitors but was happy to find this widescreen. The brightness issue some have mentioned is not a problem for me but I suspect those who have play games without the lights on. Then it may seem too bright. I would recommend this to anyone,0

4988,"Fine, but not without problems. There are an awful lot of people fawning over any Bose product. Do Bose employ people to give their products uncritical reviews? I sense a conspiracy.There are also a large amount of reviews panning Bose products out of hand. Do rival companies employ people to rubbish Bose's name? Again, perhaps a conspiracy surrounds these pages.Anyway, I am just someone who is obsessive about music, on too tight a budget to call themselves an 'audiophile', but I nethertheless aim for the the best sound I can afford. Essentially I am very satisfied with these speakers (which I use with an emac or an iPod Mini), and I think the price Amazon sells them for is a fair price. I paid perhaps twice that amount, and do suspect I have paid for a name.No matter, I am generally pleased, and in my small room they do, to my ears, sound very good indeed. I think the term is 'live' - they have a nice, open sound, crisp with good range. They are also very well built - sturdy and quite heavy.One trouble: bass. It's not that there is not enough bass - there is, for a non-sub woofer system, plenty of the stuff. It is the fact that, with certain songs, they distort at even low volumes. For instance, try, say, Massive Attack on these and you'll see what I mean. It's not, perhaps, a distortion as such, but it is certainly muddy and ill-defined. I suspect this is a problem for a lot of speakers without a sub, so I don't feel like I made the wrong choice. It is simply an annoyance.The other thing is, like other people say, the lack of an 'on/off' switch is a bit silly. I don't really like the idea of these things constantly guzzling power, but I'm simply too lazy to keep unplugging them. I know that makes me a bad person, but couldn't Bose have prevented my laziness",0

However, if I fully charged them, and use them 2 days after I've charged, I often only getting around 500+ shots.On the other hand, eneloop allows me constant 700+ shoots every charge.

I have always used Lexar Compact Flash cards in the past, I have had major problems in the last year with them, and Scott Robert Lim recommends the Transcend 4GB cards on his website..so I thought, if its good enough for him, I know its good enough for me...the price had me a little concerned...it was ALLOT cheaper than I was used to paying for a lexar...but I have loved it since the day I got it, and I always use my Transend card, never the Lexar...I would recommend the Transend Card to everyone!!

5012,"The most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. My ears are really sensitive and I can't use the insertable earbuds or anything with foam.  I ordered these headphones because they looked like they would be really comfortable, and they are.I don't think they would be very good for wearing while jogging or doing aerobics but I mostly listen while I am doing housework or going for a walk, and they stay on fine.The sound quality is fine for radio, podcasts, and music.  If you are an audiophile, they are not for you either, but just for daily listening, they seem good.Every other pair of headphones I've ever had either irritates my ears or gives me a headache from pressing on my head, but I could wear these all day and not be bothered by them",0

I sent the remote to the universal remote company and they programmed the code I was missing into the remote for free and shipped it back to me for free. The turn around time was very quick about a week and a half with USPS. It now works really well and I am so glad I got it. It's made TV, Cable, DVD and VCR viewing much better. It was very easy to set up only down side I see is there is no eject button for your VCR or DVD players. It is very well worth the money though and I would defiantly buy it again",0

5017,"READ THIS!!. After considering the dock as an accessory for a future ipod, I realised that it was not as I thought, a way of charging the ipod away from a computer, but a simple device made for specific use to improve the quality of charging only. A sort of lip liner of makeups: not essential, but a nice addition.If you are looking for something to charge your ipod with away from your computer I reccomend the Apple iPod USB Power Adapter M9837LL/A as, from reading it seems this is the device I was looking for in the first place! I give this dock five stars because in theory it does what it does. May I add this is all in theory, as I am considering buying an ipod mini and I am looking up essentials for it.

I know this because my friend owns a ipod and i like my Zen much much better. Not only is this Zen cheaper it stores more music and dont worry about how thick it is. It make the Zen more durrable because I have dropped mine many many times and it works perfect. The only problem I have ever had with this product is.

5026,"Love satellite radio. I got this for hubby and me over the summer.   We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it.   WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor.  We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter.I did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next, but i don't think anybody can improve upon that.  I had the same problem w/ my itrip.We chose sirius for several reasons...i liked the classic vinyl station, my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007.The only problem i had was i couldn't read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on, but i didn't give them less than 5 stars because of this.this is the way to go, plus it has a suction mount, not a permanent mount.also, if you look on ebay, someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!!definitely go satellite, the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations.",0

As a CPA, I need to use the calculator keypad constantly. Having the ability to switch between the regular numeric pad for spreadsheet number entry and the smart calculator function is really a timesaver. Love the size. The rubber feet keep it in place on slick desk surfaces and the size is perfect for easy use. I really like having the protective cover, but it is a little hard to remove. If you have bad arthritis it would be a problem.The mouse is the right size for ease of storage and also for use. I like having the zipper cushion case for the mouse, but would have liked to also have the mouse bottom with a molded surface to store the PS-2 connector rather than a pocket in the storage case. Really a minor irritant rather than a substantive complaint",0

5031,"Took some getting used to, but they sound great!. I recently started a new job, and was happy to learn that my employer offers its developers reimbursement for up to $300 to buy headphones or earphones in order to help us concentrate in our open floor-plan environment. After doing a lot of research, I decided on this set, and I'm glad I did.At first, I did find them a little uncomfortable; the silicon cups sometimes created painful suction in my ears. After experimenting with different ear tips, I eventually realized that the way I was inserting them into my ears was the problem, and I ended up switching back to the medium-sized silicon tips that are attached out-of-the-box. Watching the movie they have on their website helped me figure out the right way to insert them, but it takes a little bit of practice and experimentation.When correctly inserted, the sound isolation is fantastic! When I have them in at my desk and music is playing, I can't hear a thing around me, much to the chagrin of coworkers with questions. (I tell them to IM me!) I used to be unable to listen to music on my commute to and from work; the San Francisco BART must be the loudest subway I've ever been on. Now the noise has been reduced to a low rumbling in the background.The earphones have a very clear sound. I can finally hear the bass in my music when wearing earphones. The bass isn't overwhelming, however, and they do make another version of these for people who do want extra low end. I'm not really a high-end gear audiophile, but I do love listening to music, and these are the best way to do that portably that I've ever tried",0
5032,Great accessory for Sandisk MP3 player. I purchased this unit for my daughter as a birthday present.  She received the Sandisk Sansa 4 gig MP3 player for Christmas and she wanted a speaker docking station to keep in her room.  The unit has performed better than I expected.  The dock emits a rich sound that belies it's small size and inexpensive price.And an added feature is that she can connect her laptop to it to play music she has residing on her hard drive!  She loves it.And her younger brother now wants one to go with his MP3 player.  So I will soon be ordering another speaker dock.I highly recommend this unit for the Sandisk MP3 players is is made for.,0

5041,"Great Headphones. After enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones, I figured it was time to step up.  As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great.  After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros.  In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that.As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on.  They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down.  I keep the volume on my ipod way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones.  The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement.  With the UEs on, it was just me and the music.  A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience.  Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by.As for the music.  I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins.  I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones.  Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time.  Next I put on some Ray Charles.  With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row.  The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section.  I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins.  While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums.  I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed.  The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive.  The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums.As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little.  I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint.  The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax.  My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips.  So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones.  Like the discomfort, this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue.When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging.  I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs.  What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had.  Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time.",0

5044,"ahead of curve. This seems like the best buy currently or at least at the time I purchased (Jan, 2007). The key is the high definition (1280x720) and ease of use. I use it as a second monitor for my home computer to display graphics etc--the graphic colours don't quite match with the other screen but I can get them pretty close.  I watch DVDs on it--this is probably what it was really meant to do.  I'm completely happy with it",0

The sound is nice and crisp, with a deep bass and a high treble, ideal for any type of audio.  The cord is nice and long at about 6 feet, but it's not too long that it will get in your way.

Battery. A real battery. Not the internal, rechargeable kind. The quick-swap, good-to-go-in-10-seconds AAA kind.3. Size. Less than three inches. Perfect size for a shirt pocket.4. Durability. I have dropped this player onto concrete 20+ times, sent it through the wash, left it in the car in -25C temperatures, slammed it in a car door, and lost it in the snow for 3 days. Yet, it still works great. (Looks like crap, but WORKS great)Cons:Maybe...1. No hold/lock button (if you care about that)2. Smaller style screen.3. Sometimes while fast-forwarding, I accidentally skip the song instead. (Probably just big fingers)Overall, this is one great player for the price",0
5072,"Solid Product For Price - Immediately Impressed. Flying to Asia I wanted noise canceling headphones for the flight.  I researched different options and was reluctant to spend a lot, seeing many poor user reviews on much higher priced products.  I read a couple solid reviews for these and thought the risk was low for the price.These are very solid on the airplane and I highly recommend them!  They reduce a significant amount of airpline engine noise and make listening to your ipod, a movie, or just relaxing significantly more enjoyable.  While they do not reduce the noise on the air plane 100% they make a very significant dent.They don't seem to work as well for non-airplane noises, however, for the price and for airplane usage I highly highly recomment these.-Smart design-Durable-Comfortable even for long hours-Good battery lifeYou can't go wrong for the price!",0
5073,"Nothing Plays the Beatles Better than Bose. Every morning I'm up with the dawn. A quick cup of coffee, then I'm at my iBook tap, tap, taping on the keys, writing away, slaving over that novel that one day is going to propel me to the stars. And while I'm doing this, I've got Billy Holiday or the Beatles playing low, so that I don't wake the woman I love or the baby.And though Billie was meant to be played with the volumn soft and the lights turned down low, the Beatles were not. They were meant to be played loud. They were, they really were. But if you're up before the sun and you crank it up, not only will you be at trouble at home, but your neighboors might not appreciate it either.So what to do, what to do?Get a Bose Acoustimas speaker system, that's answer. In all of my listening experience, nothing handles the Beatles better when you can't turn it up than Bose. The reflecting sound fills the room without rocking down the house. And your hear it all, every lickin' stichin' bit of the music. John, Paul, George and Ringo never sounded better on a quiet morning. And as an added benifit, later on, when everybody is up, you can turn the music up too and it sounds super. And on the special occasion, when you are home alone, you can rock out and play it loud, loud enough so that the neighbors might call the cops if you don't watch out.Jack Priest, a Sailor Home from the Se",0

This is the second set I bought (the first ending up not being very portable at all) and I am extremely happy with them. They are clean and clear and the perfect size for a hotel or dorm room, unless you want to shake the place. The packaging is very compact and since they are USB powered the lack of AC wire is refreshing. The case is very well designed and all the wires fit neatly inside with the speakers. All possible wires and adapters are included and the speaker wire is also the stand, nice design.  I would highly recommend this product",0
5076,Tiny. I bought this as a gift for a friend.  It is very small.  This is her first USB flash drive and she is really thrilled with it.

5077,"Very good but room for improvement. PRO:Sound is excellent! Custom equalizer actually works and doesn't distort sound much (unlike, say, Windows Media Player).Easy drag & drop file transfer! I wouldn't never buy a device that doesn't have this feature. And transfers are quite speedy.Good battery life.Wide range of file types (partially) supported.Supports WinAmp playlists.Can use as a very primitive mono voice recorder.CON:Terrible user interface, poor file navigation.This is partly due to the limited physical controls, namely the single (noisy) joystick/button, which does not feel robust and is bound to break since it gets so much use as you try to navigate the interface.You MUST use the little ""subpack"" to charge the unit and transfer files.  Very poor choice.  This thing WILL get lost. Unit should ship with 3 of them. They could easily have designed this hardware into the unit with a small increase in size.If you transfer jpegs from your camera (which you probably won't, since it's awkward) the files will be too big for the X5 to actually display, since it is limited to filessmaller than 2.5megs.  So, unless you like to shoot photos at a smaller resolution than your camera supports, all you get, in practice, is the ability to store the files on the drive.In other words, it's useless for a photographer, and, needless to say, it doesn't support raw files of any kind.  The best solution for this is a Jobo unit that's huge and expensive.Cannot delete or move files on the unit itself, must use computer.Limited ability to create a playlist on the device itself.One of the worst user manuals I've ever seen.Anyone motivated to reformat, transfer and then watch a video on a screen this small should probably try to develop some wider interests, perhaps even start interacting with the world around them..",0

All-in-all, I've been pleasantly surprised, for it has been the perfect solution for playing DivX movies through my home theater. It has even gone beyond the call of duty regarding storage media, for even though the manual states that the DivX files need to be read from a CD-R or CD+R, I've been using DVD-R discs without any issues at all (this lets me store 5-6 DivX movies on one DVD disc instead of 1 movie on a CD disc). I haven't tried using a DVD+R yet - I'll update this if I can remember to do so. Hope this helps.

I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time).Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are.

I have seen a bunch of HDTV's but I really liked the crisp, clear, bright picture of the Samsung.  I also loved how light it was in comparison to my 80lb. tube TV.  This model was a little bit cheaper than my father-in-law's, but offers the same terrific picture (I believe the only difference is that his comes in ""piano black"").I ordered through Amazon (great price!  free shipping!) and picked up the TV from Eagle USA instead of taking a day off of work to wait for them to drop it off.  They were very helpful and friendly.When I first got the TV I thought something might've been wrong with it since my picture was worse than my previous TV using the same DirecTV box.  As much as I adjusted it the picture was blurry, moving objects left trails and the picture seemed to scroll.  However, ever since DirecTV came and gave me the HD box (optomized for widescreen picture) and installed the HD satellite I have been able to appreciate this TV.  A must-have for any sports fan with poor eyesight",0

5103,"The best brand nobody ever heard of. Not wanting to upset the balance of the universe, I was a good Nikon user and used only the brands/types of CF memory cards the manufacturer recommended, thinking that stepping an inch off this list meant stepping off the edge of the world. But seeing the price of the cards on this list, and running the risk of getting one of those infamous counterfeits on eBay, put me in a quandry: I needed more memory (who doesn't?) but I didn't have the money (who does?). I decided to risk the unthinkable and looked beyond 'the list'.I did an open-ended 'net search on price vs. features in a CF card, sat back, and let the web do my walking. The best combination was the Transcend line, which I had never heard of. I narrowed my next search to the brand, and learned that this company had been making memory modules for a wide variety of applications for years, and had engineered a product capable of working under extended temperatures and other environmental conditions. Their reputation among industry professionals was golden.So I figured what's the worst that can happen? Would putting one of their CF cards in my camera leave me with a pile of D70 ashes? I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, rolled the dice and hit a 7: no compatibility issues, excellent performance, and lots of pretty pictures. (And my camera is still in one piece.)I took over a thousand pictures in three days (Arnold Classic) on that chip. Every one of them recorded and transferred flawlessly.Methinks Nikon needs to update their list",0

I was intimidated but I got it in, and it worked right away.Sony gives you some free music downloads so I went there right away to try it out.  You have to download their software which took me a long time because I have a dial up connection, but it was worth it.  You pick your song and download, which takes 15 minutes at dialup speed.  Then you transfer it right to the cd.  Bam!  I got in a hurry and used a cd-r (which is not erasable) and only put two songs on the cd.  After I took it out and played the songs it wouldn't let me put any more on the cd. So I need to wait until I have all my songs downloaded before I burn them to cd. I still have some things to learn.Sony gives you software so that you can make jacket covers for the cd and to make a track listing.  Nothing fancy but I liked it.You can watch dvd's on your computer and you can drag and drop information on your hard drive to a cd so that your info is backed up.

One, the paper trays' limit to 250 is very very slightly annoying--not a big deal normally except when producing volume.Second, the document feeder is noisier than my 1999 commercial-volume machine I got spoiled by. The noise of this one is probably no worse than any other in its product and price range. However, I now try to avoid phone conversation when the doc feeder is in use and audible through the phone. No big deal if you don't sit next to it, but I do.Third, I have not been able to get it really dark or high contrast when copying a faint document (like pencil-written ones). If you plan to use it that way there might be some frustration; however, I have not sought customer service assistance with it yet.I rate it a 4 and not a 5 simply because the doc feeder noise bothers me when I am on the phone nearby",0
5128,Convenient But.. Very handy idea works good but connect is not secure (iPAQ 3630). On an older lap top it shuts down and pops up an error that the iPAQ was drawing too much power. All in all it beats the bulky cradle,0
5129,"One of the best portable radios  ever. One of the best radios, very clear reception of local stations, high quality  sound.I use it also to listen to music  stations. Picks up a lot of shortwave frequencies, although  some of them not as clear.  Digital tuning makes it easy to find stations. The price was good also, some stores charge like $50 more",0

The setup was a snap in only 10 minutes and the integration with Rhapsody makes it simply outstanding.Party mode is also great, linking all the rooms together.The only downside is the controller will go to sleep and it takes it about 30 seconds to wake up.  Not a big deal really.Excellent unit!",0

5137,"Was worried about the ""over the ear"". I wont add anything about the sound, they sound fine to me.I never had an over the ear and was worried they would not be comfortable, and besides, they look strange.They take a bit of getting used to, but I love them now (about 2 months, 1-2 hours a day). I work in a lab, and need the wires out of the way of my stuff; the behind the ear helps the wire stay closer to my body and not dangle in front, especialy in front of my face and neck/upper chest area. (Lower, the wire is tucked behind my lab-coat leading down to the Zen on my belt.)I feel much more secure than with my older regular earbuds.",0

It almost scared me away from buying it, but now I'm glad I don't believe everything I hear. This is the fastest media I've ever used, and if someone has one that doesn't run fast, the problem is with their own system or files.

5144,"Pleased so far with the Cyberpad. I just got the Cyberpad last week and I have used it for a few days.  The product is just as I expected, thin and lightweight.  The software was easy to install although I agree with an earlier reviewer that they could have done a better job with the documentation (in fact they need to correct major typos in the ""manual"" such as change from ""lunch"" to ""launch""!).  The pen is indeed a bit bigger than what I'd like and I hope they will come up with a thinner replacement.  The notes are captured very well eventhough my handwriting is not very good (specially in fast paced meetings).  For me one of the biggest benefits is the Evernotes software package which comes with Cyberpad.  With Evernotes, I can catalog and organize all the notes taken and assign tags for specific categories which makes it a breeze to find my notes later on (which was a problem I was trying to solve with the Cyberpad). So, I would rank it a 5-star except for the pen size",0
5145,"Great DVD player. I absolutely love this DVD player because it plays MPEG format and it can read all types of disks (DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW.)  I transfer all my television programs from my TIVO to my PC and then burn them as MPEG files onto a re-writable DVD.  Then means that when I am done watching my shows I can erase the disk and re-record it.  I am able to fit between 3 and 5 hours of programing onto each DVD.  The picture quality is great and the battery life is also very good.  I take the DVD player to the gym with me so I can watch my favorite shows while I run on the treadmill.  The size of the player is perfect for this purpose and the small remote control is an added bonus.  I'll definately get another if this one ever breaks.If you have any questions you can email me at [...",0

5148,"Enoormous!!!. I have been using the same 17 inch CRT that came with a computer that died over 4 years ago, it had a 1280 x 1024 resolution and flickered quite a bit. finally i decided to upgrade to this to go with my new mac pro, let me just say that i am more than satisfied.This thing is humongous, you don't really realize how big it is until you get it set up! the extra screen real-estate is incredible, i can have two normal size browser windows open side by side, or one absolutely enormous browser window.this is also very thin, i save so much desktop space with this monitor, finally my small desk is no long cluttered due to a enormous monitor that took up half the desk. also, the stand is kinda flimsy and non-adjustable, but is can be removed and replaced with a mount, but the one that comes with it will suffice until that day comes.I played lots of world of warcraft on my crt, it doesn't look as crisp on this monitor, but not only am i willing to trade image sharpness for the sheer size of this thing, but one must also realize that a crt will always look sharper and crisper than a LCD.much like other reviewers state, the backlight does bleed through on the top and bottom of the screen but i hardly ever notice it. I also have not noticed any ghosting on this monitor since i got it. the colors are also very bright and vibrant.i was skeptical about this upgrade at first, mainly considering that i could have squeezed another couple months out of my old crt, but let me tell you, if you are thinking about upgrading to this monitor...DO IT, for the price you will not be disappointed!!!",0
5149,"Great HDTV with HDMI. This 23"" LCD HDTV has excellent image quality and looks really stylish, too.  It also comes with HDMI so you can hook up the latest HD video source such as HD-DVD or Blue-ray hi-def DVD players.  The LCD panel itself displays vivid, evenly-lit images, and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model.I personally ended up opting for the Sharp LD-23SH1U HDTV LCD monitor because the Sharp works as PC/Mac monitor (plus J&R started offering a $[...]rebate).

The 201 bounces around a lot, depending on tree cover and buildings. The 205 does a great job! On the other hand with the 201 I would have to set the watch outside for a minute before I got a GPS fix, with the 205 I set the watch by the window and it gets a fix from inside the house!

The things I like about this printer are:-small & light (I took it to my parents one day and printed out photos we took right there and then for them.)-can print 3 ways: directly from printer with memory card, by attaching the camera to it or hooking up the printer to the computer-great quality prints-allows you to add borders and print wallet size photos-print packs come with paper and ink so you are not running out of one or the otherThis is a great printer for scrapbookers since you can print the photos you need right away.  I use it to print pictures of my son that I send to family and friends.The only negative experience I had with this printer was after I used the intial cartridge that came with it and replaced it with a new one.  The first few pictures I printed came out with lines so I had to clean the print heads.  I ended up having to clean them 3 times in a row before it started printing correctly.  I was a little disappointed since at that time I had only used it for 2 days and printed about 20 photos on it.

5168,"Philips 23PF5320 23"" Flat Panel Widescreen LCD TV. I picked this model up over the weekend for $499, after researching for a good six months. We already own a 34"" HD widescreen Panasonic that we use in the living room.  Needed something smaller and less expensive for the bedroom.My review is based on using the set over the weekend. I will update if warrented in a few weeks.The set is a flat panel LCD, very attractive. Setup was fairly easy and intuitive.  I have mine hooked up to an HD Cable box using component cables, and a standard set of audio cables. The manul does not make it clear, but the coax-in is located on a detachable cover on the rear side of the TV.  I do not use the provided remote, as I programmed cablevision's remote to change channels & volume.As for PQ, there are several pre-set modes and one ""personal"" mode. The ""personal"" mode lets you choose your desired PQ settings for bightness, color, contrast, and Tint. I find the presets to push way too much red, and way too bright. I used my own settings and will calibrate with my DVE disk down the road.The audio is good, with adjustments available for bass and treble.  HOWEVER, I cannot change the tint as it is grayed out on the screen. I called Phillips this morn, and they told me I have to disconnect the cable box to make the adjustments. Will try that tonight. All in all, I am happy with the set so far. Hope the tint issue can be resolved.",0

It also adds a memory card reader, and an LCD display for picture selection and minor editing.

I had a hard time getting the computer to recognize the router.  I searched for my problem online and found the same issue where someone essentially said ""just try again"", and I did, and it worked!  Second, whenever I turn the router off or unplug it, I am required to boot up the base computer, plug the modem directly into the computer, open the internet, and then plug the cord back into the router in order for a satelite computer to get a signal.  Very odd but it works every time.  Like I said, I'm not that savvy about this sort of thing so there is probably an easy way to fix it but I don't know what it is.Overall, I'd say it's a decent item.

5181,"Great Printer, Slow Burner. There are two aspects to this printer that really need reviewed separately...Printer vs. Burner.Printer: 4The printer itself prints as well or better than any small photo printer out there.  The print speed is average printing in the highest quality print (Up to 2 min. per photo in Photo quality.)  It does print faster in Normal mode, and still, the picture is good enough quality if just being stored in an album.  The auto-enhance feature works really well.  It doesn't over saturate colors as many computer programs even do.  The enhanced photos print in a warmer / richer tone.  The red eye feature really doesn't fix your problems.  You're better off adjusting camera flash intensity and trying to prevent red eye without relying on the printer to detect and remove it.  It does fair on wide angle group shots but hardly noticeable on close-up shots.  Overall functionality is well designed.  Printer does take a while to boot up...like a computer.  Buy an extra ink kit as the one included goes really quick!Burning: Depending on your camera usage and quality, you can't just burn your 70 photos to the CD.  If using medium resolution photos, do not expect to be able to burn more than 10 - 15 photos at a time.  Copy 10 to the CD, then 10 more, then 10 more...and so on.  Tech support said it writes in only 2X speed and is intended for home use...not designed for burning high quantity / quality photos.  If planning to burn 100 photos...just use the computer.  The index page it prints is a great feature.  You can print the index of a CD and/or card.Great printer for those who don't have a computer and want burning capabilities.  There's nothing like it out there now but I expect that this idea will fill the market rather quickly.  I'm also sure that any drawbacks will be improved in future models.",0

5186,"Here's what I think and what you should do... Straight forward: you should buy this.Here's the pro's and consPro's:1 It has a nice screen, even though it is B&W, that would never get in the way. The screen is nice and large, perfect for the ebook-type person. With 3 different font sizes, you can see it in your way.2 It has a lot of features. It has a book reader (Mobipocket Reader, a nice program), MP3 player, Date Book, To-Do, Calculater, Audio Book Player, and Address Book. Plus, you can download programs from places such as Windows Market Place or C Net downloads.com3 It has handwriting recignition (or a touch screen keyboard). I always found this handy and while it's not always right, the people at Franklin really got this down.4 The whole thing is touch screen. This means you can play games on it and not be restricted to only a certian area. I had this problem with my last PDA. This also means you can download games.5 MMC cababilty. You can have gigabytes plus the 8mb on the RAM. The ebookman also allows you to back up data, a handy feature for battery drainage.6 The software is easy to use. The simple drag and drop-download system is a breeze. While some people say that downloading the OS (operating system) from the site is a pain, they didn't mention that the CD already comes with the OS.7 Convienient side scroll wheel with push in ability. You can use this instead of the scroll bars, and you can push the wheel in to enter. It's cool!Con's:1 The batteries go fast! I advise to have a spare set, and back up the data on an MMC. Don't use the backlight, that is what burns it up. The handy thing is that it has a battery indicator, so you know when it is time to change up.2 Limited file types. The ebookman allows mostly its own versions of files, such as audio books and ebooks. However, it does accept .txt (Notepad) and .MP3 (music), plus a bunch more.3 While it has a speaker, if you plan to lisen to something you should bring some headphones. The speaker is nice, yet quiet.4 The date book's alarm is very quick. What is cool about the alarms is that there is over 20 alarms that you can choose. However, the alarm only does one cycle, and then it stops. It uses an internal speaker, so you can barely here it while it is in a pocket.Otherwise, the ebookman is pretty good. While I got this from my aunt and didn't pay a penny, I think that if this is your first PDA, it's a good choice to get it for your money. And if it is true that this is your first time, you also want to get a case, screen protectors, and MMC cards (for more memory). This won't total up to more than $20.Many say the batteries are drained quickly. This is true (in about 2 weeks for frequent users), however if you do not use the backlight much you will be ok. The backlight for the 7 inch screen is the burner of all batteries. Watch the convienient battery power indicator, and you should be ok. That's what I think; the desision is up to you",0
5187,"Great on Mac, have not tried on Windows yet. I tried the Maxtor Mini III because we like our bigger desktop external drive (Maxtor one touch) which works great...but the mini did not do so well...all kinds of problems...so I researched and found this LaCie Rugged to be just what I needed and it is great! Nice design...I like the rubber on the edges of it...grips a table better rather than being slippery metal and sliding off. Fast on the Firewire 800, have not tried the 400 or USB for this yet. I plugged the LaCie into MacBook Pro and it was right there on desktop ready for files to be dragged to it. No install of software, just ready! The 800 firewire cable to it is on the short side so I did accidently drop it already when I went to move my laptop a little bit. The fall was not far and it was on a rug but handled it well. No probs.Quiet but it does vibrate...if you set it on a tv tray and put your hand on the surface of the tv tray , you can feel quite a vibration...but it must be a good thing...the drive is rotating/spinning well :",0
5188,"Does the job well. This remote is versatile and easy to program. I'm using it to control my Panasonic 42-inch plasma TV, Memorex DVD player (which came with a tiny remote that had hard-to read labels), a JVC receiver and a Motorola digital cable box. The learning feature works great. I programmed the keys I use most so that I don't have to switch from one device to another. Why spend over a $100 for a programmable remote when this does the job for $25",0

In New Orleans I used it to avoid blocked roads and to mark entry points into closed areas. I live hear, and the suroundings were so disturbed and displaced that even my own home-town was very disorienting. The backtrack  and routemaking features are  lifesavers. The screen is easy to read.

5194,"Solid Buy. I've have this tv for about a week and I love it.  The image quality is great and the setup wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I've read comments elsewhere stating that the setup is tricky however if you have cable all you have to do is split the signal and attach the split signal to the digital and analog coax inputs then let the set walk you through the setup and you're done.  The QAM tuner this set comes with means you don't have to pay your cable provider for HD channels as long as they're unencripted.  You also don't have to buy an antenna.  I live in Fort Lauderdale and subscribe to Comcast.  I don't even have digital cable but the set is able to pick up all the major networks, ESPN 1 and 2, and Discovery HD.

This was not an issue for me, as I connect directly to my receiver.I find myself watching almost anything on HD, even things I never seemed to care about before.

The old Curtis shower radio I had was very spotty.  Digital tuning is awesome.  The old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal.

5209,"The Best Case I've Found!. After much exploration, I landed on this case model and could not be more pleased.***Please note that the initial images that Amazon has posted are not actually this case - I've posted additional customer images from CaseLogic to show this model, which actually is much nicer.***With this model, you get a nice solid case which will reportedly hold up to a 10"" display portable.  I am using mine with the Philips PET824 8.5"", and it has a bit of room to spare.  Internal velcro straps secure the player and attached battery pack well.  The finish is a synthetic leatherette, decent for the price, with sufficient cushioning to protect from minor bumps and such.  One very nice feature is the adapter to split the audio to two headphone jacks so two viewers can use the player in private.  Great for the kids when the adults want a bit of silence, whew!There are two generous side accessory pockets for power cords, A/V cable, headphones, remote, etc; while the back pocket will handle six DVDs without cases in integrated sleeves, and an additional two DVDs in cases.  Sufficient for a bit of choice along your journey.The straps for securing the case inside a vehicle (either to one seat, or suspended between two) are sufficient.  It will never be as easy as having a built-in unit, but this sure makes it nice to be able to have a player in that car you bought before you were thinking ""family"", or in a vacation rental, etc.Overall, this was a great bang for the buck purchase, and kudos to CaseLogic for another quality product",0

The volume is slightly limited but the range is nice and I feel like they do give you an accurate feel for the sound mix.  Seeing as they are some of the most inexpensive monitors available I expected less and was impressed.It seems like most of the reviewers here are using them as speakers, which I personally think is a waste.  If you are just looking to find good speakers to watch movies and listen to music on your computer you'd probably be much better off looking for a good set of computer speakers, which will cost the same if not less.  I mean at that point your definately not going to be taking advantage of the 1/4 inch inputs and that's one of the reason that these cost more than computer speakers.",0

Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type!The dictionary also comes in very handy.It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work!So buy one and save some time!

5215,"What is and ain't in the box - surprise, y'all!. Needed this to find some survey markers on some land I just bought.  It came 21Mar2007, I unpacked it, and surprise, NO AC CHARGER IN THE BOX, only a piece of paper to mail in for a ""free"" AC charger.  This despite Amazon saying there's an AC charger in the box and the box itself saying there's an ""AC Cable"" inside (as well as a ""USB Cable"").What IS in the box is:1 Explorist 4001 oddball ""USB to Magellan GPS non-standard connector"" with a doodad half way up to plug in power supply from a real AC adaptor.1 Lithium Ion Battery1 battery carrier doodad which accept 3 AAA batteries and fits where the Lithium Ion battery would go IF you could ever charge that sucker up.2 manuals and a ""Read Me First"" sheet all of which assume you have a proper AC adaptor and make no mention of the doodad which accepts the 3 AAA cells.2 CD's, one with software and one with maps you can't use unless you buy an ""unlock"" from Magellans website.A piece of paper to mail in for a ""free"" AC adaptor that connects to the oddball USB cable half way up.Also, on the box (underneath a peel-off sticker) and not properly in it, is a coupon code and instructions for getting 3D Topo maps of the continental USA at a big discount(apparently Magellan doesn't think Alaska is US territory).Got on the phone with Magellan, berated the customer service rep, and was promised a ""free"" charger via UPS in a week or so (not good enough for me because I needed it NOW to do what I need in enchanted New Mexico before leaving next week).I put 3 AAA's in the battery carrier doodad, installed that instead of the Lithium Ion battery, hit the on switch and the thing lit up.Next step, connect the USB cable plug one standard end into laptop and clamp the oddball 6-contact connector on the other end to the GPS unit.  This connector is NOT foolproof and CAN be clamped on 180 degrees out of proper alignment.  Found that out when the laptop wouldn't find the GPS unit.  The cable goes backwards from the direction a mouse cable goes, back under the unit instead of out away from your hand, even though there's a catch on the connector which might (but does not) engage a recess on the GPS unit when you connect the cable like a mouse would like it's cable connected.  Admittedly the manual DOES show how the cable should properly (but not obviously) be connected backwards from how a mouse cable would be.Finally got the thing to communicate with the laptop.  File transfer works fine, with the usual ""your GPS unit (or camera or cell phone or whatever) appears as an external disk drive"" behavior.Bought the unlock for the 3D topo map at the discount price from Magellan over the web for the discounted $9.95, subsequently discovered the map software expects a COM serial connection and doesn't recognize the Explorist's perfectly good presence at the end of the USB wire.  Put that problem away for later.Whomped up some coordinates for survey stakes from county maps, USGS maps, USGS aerial photos, Google Earth sat-photos, etc, etc, starting from township corner on the USGS map and matching trees on the USGS aerial and the Google sat-photos to locate the corner in Google Earth.  Measured from the township corner to locate a slew of lot corners in Google Earth.Went to transfer the coordinates to Magellan GPS data files and found that the Magellan files use a quirky coordinate encoding.  Here's a sample file:------------$PMGNWPL,3551.817,N,10638.598,W,0002411,M,JOE'S GRAVE,,a*17$PMGNWPL,3551.827,N,10638.629,W,0002398,M,DAVE'S CHAIR,,a*5B$PMGNCMD,END*3D------------Turns out the algorithm is 100 times the degrees plus the minutes expressed as a decimal number, so ""3551.817"" means ""35 degrees 51.817 minutes"".  I put together a spreadsheet to convert degrees-as-decimal-numbers to the Magellan format and after some cut-and-paste fork and file switching I had a nice rectangular array of property corner location-estimate POI's showing on the Explorist 400 screen.Drove ~100 miles to the property area (Buckman, NM) and zeroed in on the township corner  with the GPS unit within 10 feet LIKE A CHAMP!!!  Found another survey marker, then the AAA batteries (depleted by hours of experimentation and learning exercises) went south and the display locked up and the buttons stopped working.  Put in fresh batteries, pushed the on button, NOTHING!  Howled at desert sky and cursed Magellan roundly.  Enlisted the help of Paul the friendly hippy hermit, the ONLY resident of Buckman, NM, and with his  magnetic compass and knowledge of the land, pacing off distances, we found some more BLM survey markers.  As daylight waned Paul went one way and I went another midst the cactus and the pinon trees.  Sat down, checked the batteries in the GPS unit, reversed them (the battery carrier is NOT marked with polarity indications) and IT CAME BACK TO LIFE with no data loss!!!Paul hollered he had found a marker 2 lots away from my lot.  I marked it's coordinates with the GPS unit, set the cursor to the estimated true location of the NW corner of Lot 180 of Section 31 of T19NR18E township, and the GPS unit took us to the old (1961) BLM marker (hiding under a Pinon tree with no flagging or lathe to keep it company, just south of where I estimated the night before) within 10 feet!  BINGO!!!I am currently trying to figure out whether the Lithium Ion Battery can be charged using the power provided by the laptop through the USB cable.  The unit's batery charged indicator says the thing is connected to external power when the USB cable is hooked up.  So far the results are inconclusive, I'll check again in the morning. (Checked in the morning - the thing CAN be charged off PC power via the USB cable!  See my comment to this review.)In summary, what is in the box is not what you may expect, you may get a unit with no charger, lots of stuff is NOT covered in the manuals, the battery indicator ALWAYS says 100% when running on AAA cells and polarity is not marked on the AAA carrier, the built in base map shows only major roads (freeways, etc), and the map software Magellan sells/unlocks is not obviously compatible with USB devices (although there may be a way to solve this, just not an OBVIOUS one).OK, given all of that, when you get the hang of it, this thing works very, VERY well.  As long as the battery lasts, anyway",0
5216,"Great but Needs Battery Charger. Acoustically and ergonomically, the MDR-IF3000 is all that Sony claims it is. Unfortunately, it can be recharged only on the base station: no separate battery charger is available for it.

If you need multiple headphones, perhaps a product line that provides extra battery chargers as well as extra headphones would be preferable",0

5220,"Very Satisfied  and HD Cable / HD 'Over the air ""solution. After thoroughly researching, I walked into Circuit City expecting to buy a Sony 26"" model KDL-26S2010. However, after comparing the 26"" KDL-26S2010 to the 32"" KDL-32S2010, the 32"" model was a better value. Another consideration is a feature called WCG-CCFL as described in the spec section. After a side by side comparison between the 32"" KDL-32S2010 (no WCG-CCFL) and the 32"" KDLV32XBR2 (has WCG-CCFL), the WCG-CCFL produced a  noticeably superior picture, mainly due to the higher contrast ratio and deeper blacks. I didn't mind paying the slightly higher price for an improved picture. Also, the salesman suggested I compare the Sony to a comparable Samsung that was several hundred dollars less expensive. The Samsung picture did appear slightly better to me, but the sound was a little thin compared to the Sony and I also liked the Sony aesthetics much better.One other point that others might find helpful... I get cable service but they only offer 2 of the 4 major networks in HD. So, I purchased a Philips HD Antenna(Model PHDTV3) for apx $50 and an AB switch to alternate between cable and air sources. After autoprogramming the two sources separately, I now receive 17 HD stations over the air... FREE. Switching between cable and air is a 3 step process that involves selecting input as A or B on the AB switch, selecting between cable or air from menu settings and then selecting between digital/analog from the remote control. This sounds a little confusing, but it was actually easy. Worth the effort as I can now view HD programming from all 4 networks, 2 from cable and 2 over the air (not to mention the other 15 ""air"" HD channels). Finally, I strongly suggest hooking up to a surround sound system so your ears are just as entertained as your eyes.",0
5221,"Best investment for traveling!. We always tried to use our laptop's dvd player to watch movies on long road trips, but it was a huge pain to change a movie, start a movie, or make sure all 3 kids had a good view.This dual dvd player is the one!!! Very lightweight so if you don't have the moveable headrest to velcro it to (our suv has the one piece driver/passenger seat) you can be creative so it will attach and it doesn't fall down.  The one piece cord to link both screens together is long enough to put one screen behind the driver/passenger seat and the other screen behind the middle row's seat--and you can tuck the cord in between the seats so its not in the way.  The volume is okay--they could hear it comfortably when it was all the way up but you can also listen to it through your car stereo and the problem is solved (if you need it louder)  One simple button to change a movie, PLUS it has a parental control feature to edit foul language in movies+++++++, comes with a car adapter and an a/c adapter to plug in anywhere.

5223,"One of the best cordless phones on the market. Having lived in Europe I soon realized in the US that the majority of cordless phones sold here are of poor quality. The Siemens S455 is a pleasant surprise, which may be due to the fact that this phone is designed and manufactured in Germany.Briefly, I have only had this phone for 3 days - but this is my experience so far:- Voice quality both by handset and speakerphone is outstanding- DECT is the new emerging phone standard in the US works very well and provides excellent range without any Wifi interference. It is nice to see this standard  now in the US and I suspect that it will take over the prime spot from 2.4 and 5.8Ghz phones. It is also secure- The colour screen is beautiful with a good resolution (128*128), bright, and easily legible- The user interface is good; it resembles that of a cell phone; once you get used to it is excellent. All functions are done via the headset.- The design is sleek with a platinum-metallic finish (it is plastic though under it); the headset is light, and ergonimically lies in your hand- Standard NiMH rechargable batteries are used, which makes it easy to replace.-Furthermore one can add 5 headsets (total of 6 phones), but in order cover a larger range there can be up to 4 base stations to connect additional headsets, which should satisfy even a warehouse with coverage.Things I don't know yet:- I have not yet used the answering machine, so no comment.- In other parts of the world Siemens sells USB M34 adapter for the computer, which acts as a additional base station and provides access to VOIP services like Skype in addition to the landline. This is not (yet?) available in the US, and I don't know how well it works. This could though be a nice addition especially for oversea calls.Overall I give this phone 5 stars, because I have not seen any other phone of such quality in the US. It's sleek, good coverage and sound quality, and is well built. Certainly worth the extra $20-30 in comparison to other brands.Lastly I would prefer this phone over the more expensive E45 series. It's the same phone but the S45 series is nicer, costs slightly less, and uses standard batteries (E45 uses Siemens proprietary - $$ if need to replace). Only if you need the extra rubberized and sturdy built I would consider the E45",0

5227,"Not a Home Theater projector, but can be used as such. First, for home theater use, I would give this projector 4 stars. I gave it 5 as this is a business projector, and should not be penalized for not having home theater features.I am very happy with this item. Out of the box, the colors were a mess. This, again, may be because it is not calibrated as a home theater projector. I highly suggest using the Avia video calibration DVD (with color filters to look through). It took me 5 minutes, and the colors are more natural than any of my CRT tvs!In high power mode, I can watch TV shows during the day with my blinds closed. Movies are a bit hard to watch. Once the sun is no longer on that size of my house, it works great. At night, I can watch a movie in low power mode (and the fan is very quiet), but I prefer the regular mode as colors look more vibrant with that extra boost. I sit with my head about 6 inches from the projector, so I can hear the fan, but it isn't noticable with sound system speakers at a decent volume.As stated in a prior review, the image is 4:3. If you don't have a 4:3 screen, 4:3 images wont fit. Not the projector's fault.My biggest concern is the connections, which again is due to this not actually being a home theater projector. For the best image, you need to use a component connection. As stated in a prior review, an adapter must be purchases seperatly to connect component through the VGA port. This was not specified on the spec sheet where I bought this item, and the box itself has NO info about the specs.One other thing to note...I have read that the color wheels on business projectors are different than on home theater projectors. I am not familiar enough with this to comment, but this is something prospective buyers may want to look into.Overall, I am very happy with this item. 5/5 as an overall product, 4/5 as a home theater projector",0

The quality of printing is superb.  My only negative is the high wattage of electricity that it draws when it awakes from the sleep mode.  Each time it awakes,it causes my battery backup to beep.",0

I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow.  Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy.  Hope this is some hel,0

5233,"Great for In-Car Navigation. I bought this for in-car navigation and couldn't be happier. It's literally the size of a flash drive and holds a charge for eight hours, which means that I can velcro it to my dashboard when I need to use it and not have any wires hanging in front of me when I'm driving.The USB-power source is convenient as well, because it can be charged from any USB port--a huge plus for me when I'm traveling.As far as technological performance, I can't offer any complaints. It finds satellites almost instantly and holds them very well.Easiest five stars I could give",0
5234,"Question. First of all, let me say that I LOVE this stereo.  Have had it for a year or two.  I don't think you can do any better with this price range, and more. I highly recommend it.I have a question - does anyone know whether this stereo plays dvd's of all regions?  I tried to write JVC an email but didn't get any response.Hopefully somebody has the answer!Thanks",0
5235,"Good quality, but you can run out very quickly. When you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great, but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate. It really seems to run out of one color much quicker  than the others. Personally its usually red. It has caught me with my pants  down a couple times, going to print out a project the night before its due,  only to run out of red or blue ink. I would definetly suggest to always  have an extra one around just in case",0
5236,"it's no Sandisk, but for the money.. Sandisk has a benchmark test that relates NNNx to time. It is 150KB/sec = 1x. It follows that 120x is equal to 18MB/sec. I see no real advantage to spending twice the price for a small improvement in speed, especially when I'm not taking photos like a model photog. ""That's it, Baby. Pout for me; work with me. Make the camera believe."" Click...Click...Click. I mean really, how many of us are going to take bursts of photos? Even the few times I've used burst, I haven't saturated the buffer.I've seen no degredation in performance, color, recyle, or download time over other more expensive CF cards. There are probably other cards that can out perform this one, but with what advantage",0
5237,"most comfortable fit, better isolation. I don't know why Shure doesn't provide at least 1 pair of the EA306 triple-flange sleeves with their products. In short, they provide the most comfortable fit and best sound isolation. We own a pair of E3C's and E5C's. I would recommend them more for the E5C's than the E3Cs and I'll tell you why. The E5C is much larger in your ear and the stem that comes out from them is proportionatly shorter than the stem comming out of the E3Cs. I liked the foam inserts for the E3C. With the E5C, the triple flange provides a more comfortable fit and a better seal in the ear which means better sound! I had to really take a chance when I bought these - being that I paid over $500 for the E5Cs, I was reluctant to spend the $10 for the sleeves but am glad that I did. They do what they are designed to do. I was very pleased with the isolation and greater sound. Before, I used the foam sleeves with the E5Cs and found myself trying to push them further in my ears to hear the sound better! These give the E5cs a better, more stable fit in the ear which is also more comfortable. I was a bit disappointed with the E5C ear buds until I purchased these sleeves. I highly recommend them and wish Shure would consider adding a pair of these to the 12 ear pieces that come with the E5Cs",0
5238,"LOVE IT!. WOW!.....yea that pretty much sums it up! Picture quality is AMAZING in HD. SD is also very nice as well.

5241,Great  Little Product for the iPod. Just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers. It does just what it's intended to do - produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit. I had no trouble at all with the remote - it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the iPod from a good 10 feet away. My only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful! Altec Lansing could do well to improve their in-box instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself. I was almost ready to return my unit initially when I discovered - only by accessing Altec Lansing's web page for the iM3 - that I had to remove the not-too-obvious plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my iPod 4G 60GB photo. Otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price,0
5242,"As described. This is such a great solution for me.  I was looking for one of those tablet PC's, but they're just so cost prohibitive right now.  So for 5% of the cost, this does what I need to do.  It's really easy to use and carry around.  The carrying case is bulky for me, so I just throw it in with my tote bag.  The only thing that would make this even better is if they either made the pen thinner so it's easier to write with or make it compatible with a regular pen",0
5243,"The BEST wheel I have EVER used!. Over the past 25 years of gaming, I have used many different steering wheels for lots of different systems. I always buy a new wheel when it comes out, and most of the time it is only used a few times. But, when I bought THIS wheel, it was different. THIS WHEEL IS GREAT! It doesn't emulate the controller like some wheels do. The GAMES are MADE to work with this controller! I've tried most of the supported games, and they are great! Except Super Mario Kart DD is easier with the standard controller, but it is still MORE FUN with the wheel. I would also get the Gas & brake pedal kit. It adds an unbelievable amount of fun to the game!

5245,"zenner. I researched various MP3 players and chose Zen for recording capability, FM radio, replacable battery and format compatability. I came across complaints from people about the headphone thing, but I have not had that issue. As for battery life...I played it throught my home stereo, it lasted about 8 hours before I turned it off, it may have lasted another hour or so looking at the battery hourglass monitor. As for the battery lasting 2 hours...I think the volume people play their MP3 players affects how must the battery is eaten up, but 2 hours is odd. I think like any product,some will have success, others will have misery. It's a crap shoot.PS: I had issues with Rhapsody too. Now  I use Yahoo with no problems",0

I think mine is a floor demo as the tape sealing the box had been broken.The radio is in perfect condition, all functions work fine, all origonal packaging. I recommend this buy for as long as it will last, it is a great price. I enjoy this radio more than my other portables as the sound is much better & I like twisting knobs.",0
5247,"Unparalleled quality. A review of literature available on the internet convinces me that the fabrication of MAM-A disks is not exceeded anywhere else.  The Phthalocyanin dye is the highest performance dye available.  The gold refelective layer is as good as it gets, and the Diamond Coat Finish provides resistance to scratches.  So, how well do they work?  I have a pretty standard computer with DVD burner.  The disks have been flawless.  I haven't lost a single disk and they play on everything I've got.  This is an outstanding product.  Just use some common sense in where you store them.  It's a small price to pay for knowing that your critical data/pictures/music will be there many many years into the future",0
5248,"Excellent Documentation, easy install. I am not a career computer builder but I have built several of my own machines over the years.  The manual with this motherboard, by far, had the most clear documentation and install process of any I've seen.The board was shipped with accessories including SATA cables, standard ATA133 IDE cables and more.Bios has lots of customization/tweak options for geeks (I am sometimes one) but works easily with a default install and letting settings auto set and auto detect.The board layout seemes to not have any ""gotchas"" like this cable blocks access to that slot/plug, etc.This purchase was to replace a malfunctioning motherboard. I used the same hard drives(Maxtor SATA160GB's), memory (corsair)and processor-- AMD 64 X2 3800 (not sure about the 3800). Using the serial ata raid stripe, I saw major performance improvements by just going to this motherboard and the sata raid stripe.  I didn't realize that setting up raid for windows xp requires you have a ""floppy disk"" to give it the specific driver unless you slipstream it onto the xp install. I had to buy a floppy drive just for this, and made the driver disk from the included driver cd.Overall, a great product with desirable features, and great documentation.",0
5249,"Great product for mobile sound... Considering its small size, this unit puts out some pretty good sound included a good level of bass.  Although its not meant to lead an outdoor party, it is great for a small gathering, out at the beach, or in the backyard while you work in the garden.  I love that it can easily store my iPod as well, making it a nice single unit to carry around (assuming its been charged!). After charging, I've never had it die on me and I've been outside for a few hours with music playing the whole time.  The rugged case is also great.  It feels very sturdy and the case wont likely ever become scratched or damaged because of its tough exterior material.  All in all, a good buy considering the quality of the build AND ESPECIALLY the awesome sound",0

5255,"g3 logitech mouse as a gaming mouse. Compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000, this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy, precision.  What I find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size.  The size comes in handy if I need to flick, but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot, it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. The ""change sensitivity"" button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement, therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary).  These are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and I would highly recommend it",0

It holds 25 cd's, we hit random play when we get up in the monring and never have to touch it again for the rest of the day. Worth every penny! I really thought that there was a typo on the price the deal was so good. If you love music, you can't go wrong with this item",0

That wouldn't really work for me, as there are about 99 banana jacks on the back of my Sony receiver.About Parts Express, and Dayton Audio... everything I've gotten from them has been very high-quality, and very reasonable prices.

5262,"excellent rugged quality but overall: oddly sized. this uber-sleeve or micro-attache is sound, good looking and ruugedly constructed - no complaints there.  However, as an attache it comes up short.  It is so perfectly sized for my macbook pro 15.4"" laptop, that there is virtually no room in there for anything else.  Some papers, and maybe a dvd or two, but that's it.  There is not even close to enough space to bring along my power supply.  Once already once i have left with my bag all packed, only to discover i also eft my power supply behind.  Ok, so maybe it is just a sleeve... except it is ever so slightly too big to comfortably fit inside my oversized messenger bag!  What up that!!  I find i wind up going places with two bags, and that feels a bit silly.  The nice included (but uneeded) padded sholder-strap went straight to my binoculars.  Of all the alternatives i found shopping around online, this one still seems to be the best, but there was one  futuristic black? and orange molded neoprene skin-snug case that merits deeper inspection.   Perhaps that case (also designed specificaly for the MacBook Pro) is more streamlined in its exterior dimensions.  The good news is with the Brenthaven Edge II, i know my gear is well protected.    Conclusion: nothing is perfect",0
5263,"Great for an IRIVER. The little sports case and arm bands that comes with the IRiver are a pain.  This is great.  The arm band is comfortable and easy to use with one hand.  The case is very solid and protects the IRiver. Only draw-backs: you have to take the IRiver out of the case to plug in the USB cable (didn't have to in the original one), the clip has come undone (but not during exercise), and the arm band is almost too big for my arm (probably won't work at all for children).  Other than that...perfect.",0

No complaint about the printer, but a warning that if you are going to use this in an office where you need to network it, you'll need the additional hardware for that, which is another $150 or so.

Also, this is a black & white printer, so don't be misled by the fact that it has color scan.",0

I have been working on putting together digital scrapbooks for my kids, and this scanner has made the job much easier, and fun. I thought the scan speeds were more than acceptable. I scanned several negatives at the same time, and while it was a little slower, the quality (which I feel is more important) was great!",0

This device, being a combo and at a decent price immeidately caught my attention and I bought it inspite of my friedns' warnings against D-link.The setup of the base unit was easy but as soon as I installed the card, I figured that something went wrong. After a 2 hours discussion with cust-support, I was told that I would have to use Static IP addresses on both PCs to connect to internet, as the DNS server of the Base unit had some issues. That is fine as long as my both pcs are used at home, but I have to change my network setting everytime (to autodetect an IP address) whenever I have to take my PC out or if someone bring another device to my home. I happened to change my service provider and discovered that the TCP/IP setting of my main PC had corrupted and needed reinstallation.Other than that, its been working fine since last 2-3 months.

I was immediately glad I did.  The computer runs much better now, and I feel I got a very good value for the performance.  Since then I've purchased and installed several more sticks of this exact product for computers for family members.This isn't, of course, the best RAM out there (the subtitle of the product is ""Value RAM"").  It is, however, an inexpensive way to juice up a computer.  To me this is the ideal product for someone who has a cheap computer and wants to improve performance without investing too much money into it.  For normal computing (Windows, internet surfing, etc), this RAM is more than sufficient, but it works for gaming as well.  Of course you won't get the same caliber of performance you'd get from more expensive RAM, but you'll be amazed at the time and headache this product can save",0

I guess the only word of caution I'd give is that it lacks a CLI.  Administration is done via a set of built-in HTTP/Flash pages, accessible from any web browser.

I subjected this thing to almost every scenario except Mac.  Read on...I used it at my office (at a major research university) where I connected, among other things, a vintage (circa 1999) Windows XP desktop, a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop with XP, two variants of the Dell dual XEON workstations running RedHat 8+/-1 and Fedore Core, an IBM Thinkpad laptop running XP, a custom built AMD Athlon 2800+ running every major linux distribution except Debian as well as XP, and a custom built AMD 4400+ dual core machine running Suse 10.  Network cards ranged from motherboard-based to 0 and 4 year old Netgear cards.I used cables from 3 to 30 feet long and connected this to both a brand new wall jack and a retrofitted jack in a Cold War era building.  Finally, the room this equipment operated in was subjected to temperatures from 55 F to 110 F, as my office was not air conditioned during the summer and it was colder outside at 100 degrees (the above computers made a lot of heat).We had major power outage/surge problems which didn't faze this thing one bit, but were able to ruin more than one expensive APC UPS unit.Oh, and I downloaded at least 100 GB through this card during this period",0

For the longest time I really didnt think $12 a month was worth this kind of radio but after buying the sr-2000 and getting it all hooked up in my car I soon changed my mind.Biggest thing for me is hardly any DJ talking, they really keep the music going. I noticed on a couple other reviews this was not the case, I listen to only the rock stations so I cant comment on other stations. I live in the Seattle area and using the FM modulator really sucked, every station had static. I found an audio input cable online to fit my car stereo for a direct connection and oh man what a difference!!  Crystal Clear!  I did have to play with the bass and treble a bit to get the best sound and since I have a sub-woofer I used the fader a couple of clicks to the front (away from the sub) and really got it sounding great.It doesnt sound as good as a CD but much better than regular Radio.

I am so glad I did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision! As mentioned in another review, I love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again, it also fits in my back pocket so I can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores, the earpieces fit well, there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman!

5289,"D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch. Switch was simple to install to my existing network, just plug and go. I used this switch to separate some CPUs off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway. Worked just as planned and was seamless. I actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch. Network speed and response time increased even for those CPUs w/out a gig nic. I like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic. Highly recommend",0

5291,"Versatile and powerful. I like that this came with both a plug for the cigarette lighter and clips to attach directly to the battery -- very versatile.  I don't know what else to say about it; it's a power inverter, its ability to invert power met my expectations.As a point of reference, this inverter will handle the load from a video projector, 50-watt speaker and PlayStation 2 effectively",0

5294,"Very Good!. This mouse is of very good quality. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the range is very limited, but if you are using it with a laptop, then it shouldn't be a problem.  The buttons are easy to push and the scroll wheel is very nice. The laser sensor works on a number of surfaces with no problem. Once the USB adapter is plugged in, the mouse is connected in seconds. Plus, the price is very good",0

5296,great bargain. the overall apperance is good and the keys feel firm (not cheap as i feared) the mouse lights up also wich my daughter really liked. i would recomend this keyboard.the cons are the mouse is a little small (great for a teenager) and it is shipped without an adapter so you will need 2 free usb ports,0
5297,"iPod Nano 2 GB. Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use.  Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition.  Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good.",0

They just don't discharge like the normal NiMH batteries I have used (and been disappointed by) in the past.The only downside is the price, but in the long run I think they will be worth the money.",0

5300,"Works fine, but not really needed. My review of this is based on my rating for the Forerunner 201 unit itself. This is just the bracket, and it works fine. However, you don't really need it if you don't mind simply wearing the 201 on your wrist. The one caveat is that it is, of course, easier to see the unit when you are riding if it is mounted on the bike versus strapped to your wrist.My recommendation is that if you are going to use the 201 for both running and biking, don't buy this bracket because you can simply wear the 201, plus then you don't have to deal with trying to remove the wristband or making a tight squeeze fit into the bike bracket. But, if you are buying the 201 only for biking, this may be useful because then you could simply ditch the wrist strap and keep this mounted to the bike at all times.",0
5301,Love It. I have started to use this with my new gaming computer and i have found it a very nice product.  I got it for $340 making it cheaper then the others and also making it a very good buy after spending so much on other things.I would highly recomend this and hope you get it for as good a deal as I did from this site,0
5302,"good things come in small packages. The Garmin eTrex Venture Cx has variously been described as a stripped unit, or as a GPS for someone who wants just the basics.  In truth, it is a Legend Cx in a different color.  It's perfect for someone who already has Garmin software and a USB cable.  No memory card comes with it, but the Legend Cx only comes with a 64Mb card, and virtually everyone will want a much larger card, so why pay for the small card to begin with.  Bottom line is that the Venture Cx is a flat out bargain, just about the best ""do-all"" GPS unit for someone who needs power and portability",0

5309,Great Portable DVD Player. I had already gotten a portable DVD player but after I saw this one I took it back.  For a cheaper price I got this one.  The screen is larger and the battery life is longer.  My husband and son LOVE it.  We haven't experienced any problems with it.  Great Buy,0
5310,"Works for me. This is my second digital recorder and I'm very happy with it. My first one,(from radio shack) was barely audible even turned all the way up but this one is very loud and clear. It even records clearly in noisy rooms. I'd recommend this recorder since it records and sounds perfect.",0
5311,"All the features you really need. I used this little GPS for a recent trip to California (I live in Boston, where it also works great - I've learned several new routes to work thanks to this thing) and it was a lifesaver!  Everyone's first reaction when they see this is, ""It's so cute!""  And it really is.  Petey, as it is affectionately called, works great stuck to my window (great suction cup mounting system)in the corner where my view is already obscured by the plastic sideview mirror mount on my Ford Focus.  It also sits very comfortably in the cupholder for states like CA that don't like GPSs stuck to windshields and windows.The screen is pretty small, but has exactly the right amount of information to keep me on track.  Despite being monochrome it is very clear and easy to read.  Additionally, the voice instructions are clear enough that I never really have to look at the screen anyway.Accurracy has been surprisingly good!  It's amazing to watch it update as I'm driving, and it knows exactly the moment when I pass an exit on the highway or make a turn.We also laugh at Petey's ability to save face.  Rather than ""wrong turn, stupid!"" it simply says, ""recalculating..."" and gets you where you're going anyway.  Sometimes it takes a few seconds (5-10), but it's definitely fast enough.It's also great that you can save your current location just by holding down the scroll wheel, look up nearby points of interest, zoom in and out on the map view, and review your route while enroute.The one drawback was that it was a little tedious entering all of the addresses using only the scroll wheel, but it does a great job of narrowing down your options quickly.  If they added an option to do it while connected to the computer it would be a real plus though.  (And if they already have that option, someone tell me! =))Overall I highly recommend this product.  It chooses routes better than online maps do, and tells you where you are along the way!  Then, if you need gas or food, it can help you find that too.  Who needs anything more from a GPS?  And it's 1/2 the price of other units!  A great value in my opinion.",0
5312,"Just plug it in and it works. Finally! Something high-tech that basically installs itself. No hassle. No user-hostile experience. Why did I buy this? I had two LinkSys routers at home over three years and finally got fed up! With any network hiccup, I'd have to reboot the LinkSys routers and sometimes re-install the configuration software.I tried another router with the same user-hostile experience. I bought this product -- the Netgear FR114P -- based on reviews. I wanted ""plug-and-play"" or as close as I could get. I didn't want the hassle of installing software that ultimately fought with me. Yes, I can read and follow directions. But for Pete's sake, humans played golf on the moon 35 years ago. Why can't they invent a router that just plain works out of the box?I plugged the router into my network and had all my home PCs online in just a few minutes. It comes with software, but not necessary for basic functions.For the money, this was bargain for the trouble it saves in installation",0
5313,"These are great remotes. This is a wonderful remote that you can get to function exactly as you want it to.  It learns any key you want and if a device isn't in the codes, the company will search for a code or capture the code from the original remote.  This 6 Device remote I bought as a present.  I use the 8 and 10 device around my home.I bought a harmony remote and the One for All shortly after.  The harmony had to be tweeked several times and never quite worked all the components right.  Also the company monitors and saves all your information and the software is constantly running on your computer.  The Harmony's buttons at first were hyper sensitive then they wouldn't respond at all.  I had to replace the harmony (under warranty) because the screen went out.  The second, although the screen hasn't gone out, has the same problems, it turns off my TV when I try to switch from DVD to TiVo yet it doesn't the other way (makes no sense).  To be fair, my TV wasn't in the data base so I still had to use the original remote and point it at the harmony to set it up.  It constantly got the inputs wrong, I tried several different methods, all but call the company (I hear they have great customer support), but finally I would change the inputs manually.  It doesn't give you that choice at first.  It was a lot of computer to  TV- computer to TV time.  This remote, the One for All, is so much better.With the harmony you didn't have the option of picking one of the seldomly used keys and reassigning a function that you use more frequently (zoom of the TV or Live TV for Tivo) they decide for you which functions are the frequent and assigned to main keys and which you will have to scroll for.  I would use the the Live TV and the input for SV frequently so on the ONE 4 ALL I could assign any key I wanted to do those function.The One 4 All remotes are less expensive and the same quality if not better (no screen to go out, buttons push better) than the Hamony. All for Ones customer support will search for new codes and capture your code if they can't find it to upgrade immediately.You can program any key you want to do what you want.  You want to control the fan in the room, the space heater or a/c, whatever has a remote as long as it isn't Radio Frequency, most are remotes are IR.  If you want RF also you can get the One for All URC 9910 and then you can send signals through the walls and change the channels from other rooms in the house.  Want your Tivo to control two different TV in different rooms of your house, its RF to IR converter would do that.  Personally I only need the IR remote part so this remote, here at amazon under $20 today, is the best.  The One for All Learning Upgradeble Remotes 6 Device, 8 Device and 10 has literally taken the place of all of my old remotes.  I use ONE remote for all the devices in my house with remotes.  I have bought extra remotes of this brand to have at my couch, my bedroom, my computer.  I have bought these remotes as presents for family at this point.They are great remotes and I'm glad I found them",0

There are many out there but I wanted the whole pedestal and everything.  I found this particular machine at a few places but Amazon had the best price!!  It was just as expected and we really love using it.  It also has a radio feature so when cleaning the basement I just put the radio on and the speaker on the pedestal is great!!!The kids love the camera so they can see themselves on the tv while singing.  It is really great!!!! I highly recommend!!,0
5318,"Very good. Goods- Four Additional USB Ports in one PCMCI slot.- No additional driver, s/w installs required (I used it on Win XP Pro- SP2)- Comes with an additional Power chord for the USBup. This is a must, if you   are planning to use the USB for external device which take power (External hard-disk, iPod, Zunes etc.). My Dell laptop's mother board started acting crazy because I made the mistake of using power consuming devieces on the original USBs. But with Micros Innovations I can trust the external power source to take care of these devices- Great service by Amazon - My first package throuugh UPS was sent to my previous address and even thought it was partly my fault, Amazon immediately shipped a replacement.Bad- Like any other PCMCI card, it portrudes outside the laptop, so one has to be careful in moving the laptop around when it is plugged in",0

5321,"worthy alternative for cd/dvd printing. I needed a printer for printing on DVD's, and wanted something other than HP or Epson (Epson's cartridges are said to show ""empty"" before they are; and I didn't like the HP reviews).This printer, when sold in Europe is capable of prining on cd's but doesn't have the feature when sold in the US..but it's the same printer, just missing the cd tray. You can buy the cd tray at pe-labs.com (they also sell on Amazon). You also need to configure your printer so that it ""thinks"" it's in Europe...the pe-labs's site tells you how to do this. Then you just download the free cd printing software from Canon's European site.I'm very satisfied with the quality and ease of use of the software. You do have to store the cd tray seperate from the printer between uses, which is a minor inconvenience. But that is minor, and I still give it 5 stars",0

5325,Excellent Radio. I am completely pleased with this radio.  It brings in quite clearly several FM stations in my area that my other radios cannot receive and the reception on the Tivoli is always clear  with a pleasing and well-balanced tone.  There is no distortion even when the volume is turned to full!  I've recommended this radio to friends and they have been very pleased as well.  This is a great value for such a small radio that is both beautiful in its design simplicity as well as providing the fidelity of receivers that are much larger and far more expensive.  This beats the Bose and others hands down,0
5326,"Color most true. I was first introduced to a Huey by the senior most photographer in our office, a man with nearly over 40 years experience in the field.  As soon as I could, I added one to my home system and have never stopped using it.  I now have two, carrying one with my laptop",0
5327,"A good tool for lecture recording. I purchased this for recording lectures in seminary, and thus far it works quite well.  The sound is muddy for sure, but understandable.I record most lectures on the high mic setting, and 'SP.'  The other, higher recording settings are easier to hear/understand but aren't worth the extra storage space.Even though the player holds 64 mb, it takes up more space on your PC after converted.  I would like to try the recorder with a mic attachment to see the quality increase.The batteries are said to last about 25 hours, and I can't say either way how long mine lasted.  If it was shorter it didn't seem like it.The functions are intuitive (to me) and I figured out most all of the functions in about 15 minutes.This is the first digital recorder I've purchased or used, but I like it and would recommend it to anyone wishing to record lectures or conversations or whatever.  I think you would need an external mic if you wanted to record music.  I did so on the highest setting and it was pretty muddled.  Not really worth listening to again.",0
5328,"reliable, and I like the rubber cover. I've had this drive for over two years. I've had one minor problem (I loaned it to someone, and they corrupted it - don't know how), but I transfer regularly back and forth from Mac to PC (I use it formatted FAT), and I've had no problems. I've only formatted it once (after it was corrupted, see above).The rubber cover is an opinion thing. I personally think it's a great feature. I can throw this thing around without worrying about it at all. I don't use it as a keyring, but I know a friend who does. Once nice little feature is a white space to write (w/ permanent marker)",0

5330,"An interesting tuner with outstanding selectivity. The HDT-1 is certainly an interesting and somewhat versatile product.  The interior chassis is composed of two modules, one for signal processing and the other for power - taking about 1/10 the volume inside the empty cabinet. The exterior has a bluish-purple lcd display which is not dimmable and has a  digital clock which does not keep accurate time as it is not locked to the 60HZ line frequency. There are direct entry buttons and 20 memory presets for AM and 20 for FM.The signal strength meter is almost useless as it varies with modulation on the analog stations.The C/N ratio feature on digital FM is a valuable feature and works well to determine antenna placement. The remote is very small and thin but can easily become lost in the chair cushion.Now to the actual performance. There is a very strong blend imposed on any but the best signals which causes a great loss in separation but a clear signal which approaches mono in analog. The sensitivity is good but the unit definitely overloads easily in the presence of strong local signals - correctable with a variable L-pad but at a loss of ultimate sensitivity. The selectivity is simply outstanding as a very weak distant station can easily be heard just .2 MHZ or adjacent to a local. If you are looking to receive a weak station in a crowded station environment then this tuner is for you. I can receive a station 300 miles away with NO interference by an adjacent local. This is more than I can do with my two professional tuners on very narrow bandwith. This feature alone has sold me on this tuner.The audio output is VERY high, far above the 600mv standard and it might overload some preamps. This makes comparison difficult as the audio is 2-3X louder than other components. The tuner automatically indicates the presence of HD signal on AM and FM but requires several seconds to load the digital buffer. The HD signal is better on some stations with improved separation and upper frequencies but on a few it is worse. It would be assumed that broadcasting quality in HD varies a great deal among stations but that the tuner is doing a good job in the expansion process. It definitely sounds better than satellite radio but it does not  reflect the ads which indicate CD quality. Long distance stations frequently do not stay locked in HD, and if you are on HD-2 or HD-3 station, it falls back to analog and reloads on HD-1 - a great annoyance. The tuner  has  many display options and even an audio spectrum. None of the features have a detailed explanation in the instructions.What would I like to see on this unit? I would like an optical output, a blend and high cut switch so I could make that decision on a weaker signal, a clock that keeps time or no time display at all, a more normal size remote, 30 presets on FM and 10 on AM if I am limited to a number and an AM stereo HD that really works - this one sounds poorly. DO not try to listen to a digital unit and a regular tuner at the same time as there is always delay in the digital processing.I believe this tuner has many good features for the price of $199.00. It is definitely the most selective tuner I own - better than my Kenwood KT-9900 and Yamaha TX-950. Sure, there are always changes we would like but I am sure that a low price point was important to Sangean and I believe they made wise compromises except for the non-defeatable auto blend.",0
5331,"Excellent printer. First of all, I rated this printer at four stars only because its an ink hog. To be fair, I print high resolution photos so I suppose thats to be expected.

Now, if they just made bulk magazine cartridges...",0
5332,"Excellent universal. Overall this is a very good remote.  It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled.  It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems.My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up.  These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices.  I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again",0
5333,"Great for the Price. This is a very good (not great) case for storing your CDs with jewel cases.  It only holds 57 store bought CDs and it is a bad fit in the corners for that extra CD that you what to stuff in.  It is EXCELLENT for CDs that you burned that do not have store bought cover art and jewel cases.  It will hold hundreds this way.  It is not as solid as it looks in the picture, but it looks like it will take a fairly good hit and still protect your CDs and it is fairly light weight.  All in all it is a great product for the price.",0

The software is easy to configure and the macro buttons make life much easier. This remote is an excellent addition to any media setup",0

It works great for what I use it for, phonebook, scheduling, notes, etc...  Would be nice if you didn't have to scroll to see entire address lines and if it had a search mode for the scheduler, but very good value overall.  If you don't need email, video, phone, etc., then this is definitely worth checking out.  Touchpad screen is remarkably accurate and easy to use.",0

They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it!

5342,"It does have force feedback, but weak in my opinion. I bought two of these wheels last month and I'm about to order 2 more (I'm setting up a little company picnic racing rally). I played Midnight Run II (windows) with these wheels and didn't experience the force feedback either. However, when I played NASCAR 3 with these wheels, then I got vibrations in the steering wheel when taking turns too tight, but nothing when bumping the wall or another car. The force feedback amounts to a 'humming' vibration and is actually annoying. btw - there's an option in NASCAR 3 you have to turn on for the force feedback to work. The force feedback was just a 'nice' feature for me, but I really got it for the USB connection and table top design. I have a couple of the Interact V3 racing wheels and their 'sit nestled between your legs' design is awkward to deal with and it's too tall to effectively use them on a table. But the LogiTech wheels work great on a table top! The LogiTech connectors are a little more reliable too. The pin connector housing on the V3 snapped off pretty easily on one of the wheels. However, I do prefer V3's full size pedals to the LogiTech smaller pedals... but it's satisfactory",0

Sound quality has been fine and I have no complaints about this one. It arrived the next day, too!",0
5345,"Better than my old Belkin model. It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me.The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.",0

5347,"Great Picture, 1 missing feature, 1 side effect. Overall this TV has a great picture and sound.  We use it for OTA HD broadcasts and my original intent was to hook it up to a Media Center PC.  I did get this to work with an DVI - HDMI cable, but the problem (missing feature)is this model was not intended to be hooked up to a PC.  (The D41U, D42U D43U and D50U all are) At 1280x720 (720p) the screen looks good with the exception of all the edges are missing/off-screen.  So I can't see the time in the bottom right, and most of the start button is missing on the bottom left, the X is missing from a maximized program in the top Right, etc... The Media center interface doesn't really care, since you use a remote and navigate around just fine, but checking email is a bit of a challenge.The only side effect is the back-light feature (which I wanted to turn down in a dim bedroom) causes a humming noise when set to 10 or less.  I called sharp support and their suggestion was to adjust the brightness to offset needing to have the backlight up to 11+",0

5349,"90% Great 10% Bad. Bottomline regarding the Samsung 1080p 52"" is that I am quite pleased. The only LCD I saw that may be better is the Sony but it is my personal feeling that you are just paying for the name. I was also told that the screen on the Samsung and the Sony are made by the same manufacturer so the only difference is asthetics and extra features. The Sony however comes with a stiff price increase.I have a very bright room and I am energy concious so a plasma was not a good option for me since they catch a lot of glare and use more power. The picture quality you get out of a plasma in the right setting still is superior to LCD but only in certain instances. The Samsung LCD picture is awesome 90% of the time, where it falls short is in very dark scenes. There is a problem with what I found from other blog sites and reviews (based on the Sony with the same screen) of ""light leaking"". In very dark scenes the picture is sometimes not totally black you can see what appear to be shadows or pixel movements. Now most people don't even notice it but if you're a perfectionist geek like me it is an annoyance. However, for me the LCD is still the better choice than plasma and I would not change my decision the picture quality is excellent most of the time so it is not a big deal. Of all the LCD's that I have seen this one along with the Sony have the best picture quality hands down. Although, Sharp's new box is getting close. Don't be fooled by low end manufactured products claiming to be as good. Carefully, look at the specs and the picture quality particuarly during fast moving scenes where you may catch bluring.I have not had the opportunity to see how the 1080p resolution looks yet (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD) but I'm sure it is as breath-taking as HD.I bought this TV recently after years of watching, reading and waiting for pricing to get to a point where I thought it would be the right time. Whatever you thing pricing will do it seems the fact of the matter is that technology will always be better and pricing better the next year, you just have to jump in at some point. Pricing has taken a significant drop in the last 2 years on such items",0

I recommend getting the 508d Dual motion sensor where it warns at a distance and then alarms if someone comes too close to your car. This the the Best same thing as the python 990 top of the line security and remote start they sell at circuit city for more.

I do not run them through an USB2 hub, but directly from an USB2 port on the motherboard, or from an USB2 port on an USB2 adapter plugged into the motherboard bus.The 250-GB has a new ""multi-funtion"" button (instead of the two buttons on the 160-GB) ...

As someone who primarily uses their laptop on the go, I have been looking for a set of small, easily transportable, decent sounding speakers. These fit into all three categories. I am pleasantly surprised by the fullness of the sound that they put out. If you're strictly an audiophile, you'd be better off investing in a good set of Bose headphones, but if you need something to quickly and efficeintly plug and play so other people can hear what is on your laptop, then you won't find a better buy for your money.",0

Ordering a big screen TV online was definitely a new experience for me, but having read the other reviews about delivery service with Amazon, I was much more comfortable with trying it.... and I am so glad I did.  To say I love the TV would be an understatement!  The picture clarity is fascinating!  We had to wait for the cable company to set up the new connection, but in the mean time, we tried a rabbit ear connection and the picture we got with rabbit ears was unbelievable!  The TV came when it was supposed to be delivered and Eagle set up the TV - wouldn't leave until they saw the TV come on to its menu screen and they carried out of the packaging.  I definitely recommend both Amazon and the TV - both were better than I could have imagined!!",0

But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment",0

I am hoping that in the long run this printer will pay for itself and cut the costs of having pics developed at the store,0

I frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little.  Overall great product and I expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs.  Works very well in tandem with a WACOM tablet,0
5369,"Great AM Reception & FM Sound. I got this radio when Amazon had a special for $35.00; although they noted that it was discontinued, they started to sell it again. Pro's - Great AM DX reception, even during the day. I am able to pick up WBZ in Boston very clear during the early afternoon hours. None of my other radios will even come close. Has a nice back-lit LCD than can stay on all the time. Uses either 4 D cell batteries or 4 AA batteries (nice idea). Light weight with plenty of buttons and knobs. Con's- Does not have preset function or search/scan. You have to use the tuning dial, which can go over or under the frequency; however, the frequency lock works great. A great radio for $35.00; however, I would not pay over $50.00 for it.",0

With their help I had the problem quickly solved.I'm not overly thrilled with the signal strength, but at least I can connect from anywhere in the house.

However, once I finally got it right, I've had no problems at all. The bottom side of the unit does run extremely hot. I just flip it upside down to help vent the heat. I rarely remember to unplug it, so it is usually left on for days at time. So far, no lockups (or fires) in my experience",0

I might as well say it, I've had my current Sangean radio (DT-300-VW) for 7 years - that's 7 years of extensive use 8-12 hours a day x 4-5 days+ a week.  While all other radios I've owned within this size range have long since 'given-up-the-ghost' (over 7 years ago), this puppy just keeps on working with the same reliability as day 1!  AM/FM/TV reception is quite remarkable as it always has.  Weather band has always been a little weak in some areas of Colorado - you can pick up several different stations if you are in the right area, which is pretty cool actually.  I would not give up this radio for anything else out there.  Just one question still haunts me - will this thing EVER die?  I hope not, but if it does, I'll get another Sangean",0

Still, after a few tinkering, I was recording  the LPs to digital.  The software that came with is not the best but it does the job.  The hiss and crackling in the background adds charm to the final product. Despite the noise in the background, one can still hear new sounds (ei. voices and instruments) that is just not obvious in the LPs.

I like this radio - mostly because it has such a large speaker for such an inexpensive radio and produces a nice sound. Well worth 20",0
5391,"Great Stereo - Almost Perfect For an Office Environment. The most important thing I was looking for in a small stereo was an auxiliary audio input so that I could plug an iPod dock (or even just an iPod) directly into the system. This system does have one RCA (left and right) auxiliary input on the back, near the speaker and antenna connections (good luck trying to find that information in any of the specs or product descriptions online).This unit looks great, it's a sleek, shiny, silver piece of art. The circular LCD screen has a great blue backlight when the system power is turned on, and there is a blue LED that shines on the CD compartment, that you can see through the transparent door.I don't plan on using this as my main home entertainment system, I bought this for use in my office, so I don't need a powerful sound system. This unit delivers very good sound at the low levels throughout all of the functions (CD, Tuner, and my iPod through the Aux). The only problem that I've come across, is that the lowest volume setting (1, on a scale of 1-20), may be just a touch too loud for a quiet office environment.Another consideration to keep in mind, is that a lot of reviews here say that this unit has a tendency to break down in one way or another. To get around this possibility, I ended up buying this unit from Circuit City for $60-something, and popping down another $19 for the 3-year service plan. So in all, I still spent less than $80-$90 total for this stereo and 3 years worth of insurance... not bad. Also, I spent $20 for a cable to connect my iPod on one side, to the RCA AUX jacks on the stereo. So, for $100, I have a system that plays CDs, AM/FM radio bands, and my iPod, for less than most iPod-only speaker systems.If you are looking for a stylish stereo system for an office, or a 2nd system for your home, I'd consider giving this one a try, for the price, you can't go wrong. Also, since it does have the AUX input, you can plug in any number of components, from a VCR/DVD player to an iPod.I've only owned this system for a few hours, so I can't speak to its durability, but like I said, if you throw on a $20 service plan, you're still only spending around $80-$90 for a great little system",0

It isn't what I would call commercial quality, but it worked fine for my needs.  I liked the fact that it could take any image off my hard drive and automatically scale it to fit the label - I didn't have to scale the image manually.  It also allowed me to print a calibration page to align the software to my printer (a simple process that it walks you through step-by-step), so that I wouldn't have to waste a label to align the printer.  One thing to be aware of, though, is that these labels are size A4, not your standard 8-1/2 by 11 size.  As long as your printer can be set to use A4 paper, you shouldn't have any problems.",0

The  software connected with the printer and ink cartridge will give you a  message on your screen that your ink level is low, and even shows you a  graphic picture of approximately how low it is, and tells you what will  happen when the ink totally runs out (that is, it will stop printing  altogether -- unlike other printers that continue to spit out blank pages).

I was previously using a RCA amplified indoor antenna given to me by a coworker who opted for a Channel Master 4228 outdoor antenna because he was 50 miles from the tower.

I have another Sharp LCD (Made in Japan) and that remote has more functions than LC52D62U and it gives me a better feel that I own an expensive TV.  Overall, it is a great TV.

5412,"Great document/receipt scanner for Windows and Linux. I've used the Canon CanoScan LiDE 60 under Microsoft Windows Vista and Ubuntu GNU/Linux 6.10, and it works great in both. I purchased this product for scanning documents and receipts, and it does its job very well.With Windows Vista, you need to download the drivers from Canon's website (they're not included with Vista). The drivers are very minimal, lightweight, and easy to use; in about 5 minutes I was scanning documents straight into Adobe Acrobat.The LiDE has to be one of the easiest hardware installs I've ever done in Linux. I plugged the scanner in, and started xsane. It detected my scanner and I was scanning immediately--that's it, no having to install or configure anything!I've a few complaints:* Noisy: the motor that draws the scanning head makes a very high pitched screech when moving. When I first received the device I thought I'd be able to use it in a library--not happening unless the library is deserted.* Adequate color reproduction/photo scanning: The color reproduction on my Epson 2450 is leaps and bounds better. The LiDE however is easily 1.5-2x faster, a fraction of the price when comparing MSRP, and has much nicer drivers.* Too lightweight to scan books easily: The scanner being featherweight is a good thing, except if you have to scan books or anything bound/stapled of more than a couple pages. Stuff shifts easily if you do not hold the scanner and book while scanning",0
5413,"Excellent Phone. I have read reviews complaining about this phone.  I disagree.  It serves its purpose very well.  I have not had problems getting over 2 hours of talk time from this phone.  I made sure my initial charge was 12 hours before I used it the first time.  Since then, I can use the phone all day without any problems.  I use skype a lot as I have family in Europe and South America.  I wonder why this phone is not readily available in large electronic stores.It is an excellent phone I highly recommend it.  I bought mine from Amazon via Beach Audio and the phone arrived on time and in good condition.I use an 802.11G router with wep128 encription and have had not problems with linking.  True it will not work at hotspots that require web based identification, but the truth is hotspots are still not ubiquitous enough to consider it a realistic option.  As a skype phone at home that does not require you to have the computer on, I find this a very impressive first attempt.  SMC should be applauded, and place this phone on more retail shelves.Dr. Houman Javeda",0

5417,"Most comfortable gamer headset yet. After doing much reading of personal reviews on forums I narrowed it down to this and the icemat headset. What put this one above the icemat's was it's retractable microphone and the fact that it had been redesigned to be sturdier.I was also worried about them making my ears too hot, as I have experienced with other headsets, but to my surprise they do not get hot and they have super soft padding around the earphones and the headband. I can wear them for as long as I want without any discomfort.The only thing I didn't like was the software that came with it. It made the bass/sound crackly for some reason. I found out that it works just fine on it's own without the software installed. So when you do get it, don't bother installing the ""drivers"" and software, it works perfect as is.

5422,"Bring the bass!. These were replacements for the V-Moda Vibes, a nice pair of cans but a little weak in the bass for me and almost no sound isolation.PROS:  Massive bass.  Highs are kept intact and are smooth.  Best price for dual drivers on the market.  Good sound isolation.  Love the over-ear memory wire, no mircophonics (exterior sounds traveling through wires).  Replaceable cord. Very high sensitivity (119 dB).  Love the double-flanged and foam ear buds.CONS:  A little big and a little ugly (okay with me, they work like hell!).  Cord about 6 inches too short.  Tight squeeze in carrying case.OVERALL:  If you love bass you will regret getting anything else.  They are easily driven by portable players and just make me smile when I turn it up.  Would definitely buy again",0

5427,"It's like having a new music collection. I don't know how they do it.  I am so amazed and impressed by the sound quality of these speakers.  You can hear the music around you as if it's 3-dimensional.  Using iTunes, I played an epsiode of Battlestar Galactica and during a dramatic sequence, I was almost knocked out of my chair by the sound.  I never considered my iMac a home theater system but hey, I think I have it now.  The bass adjustments on the back, coupled with iTunes and iDVD equalizers have enhanced my digital experience.  The closest thing to a negative was losing a USB port to it (I have a hub so not too big a deal).If quality is more important than money, I heartily suggest these speakers.  I formerly used Klipsch ProMedia 5.1 and they pale in comparison.   And don't get me started on the junk that is JBL Creature II speakers.Bose Companion 5.  Feel the music.  No kidding.",0

All the functions work great. It's easy to use and it does so much it's just about ridiculous. It's the Mother of all gadgets. If you buy one (and you will be glad) I recommend getting a protective case for it just to keep it looking like new. This compact wonder is one of the few things in life that will give me my moneys worth (and more).",0

5432,"If You Can Have Only One Radio. Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, ""grabbing"" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the ""drift"" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe.Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.",0

5438,"Seems Pretty Good to Me - But Watchout for the ""OLD"" Platinum Version. I agree that the build quality on the Platinum is slightly lower than the original 10c series I remember from the 80s (keys and case seem more ""plasticy"").  However, everything else that matters about this new version is positive.  As far as speed goes, I can't really see any difference.  I tried the interest rate calculation suggested by another reviewer, and my 12cP returned the answer in about 1 second.  How much faster do you want?  It's a CALCULATOR, not a PC!===Update: Because of the many contradictory comments here, I decided to do some further research on the Platinum. For example, my 12cP does the TVM calculation specified by another reviewer in about 1 second, whereas that reviewer was experiencing upwards of 30 seconds for the same calculation. Well, it turns out there is a FIXED version of the 12cP out there that addresses this speed issue, as well as keyboard problems, lack of parenthesis, and other issues. Unfortunately, there's really no way to tell what you're going to get if you order on-line. The model number is the same and the only visible difference that I know of is open/close parenthesis symbols on the STO/RCL keys. This should be visible without opening the retail package. I'm guessing the poor reviews here are by unfortunate folks that have the OLD version, while the positive reviews are being put in by us lucky ones",0

Guy from Providence is absolutely right - it has to be the right cable.   A cable for digital audio has to be balanced and have low enough loss that it can pass high bandwidth (ie - digital) without attenuating or causing excessive jitter, etc.  If the cheaper cable sounds no worse in your setup, maybe it's not so bad... or maybe the bit error rate was higher and just not enough to be noticeable",0

You're average pick up and go with your laptop thief wont bother with trying at it, they'll just move onto something easier. The lock design is really good, much better then the classic design that has videos all over the internet showing how it can be picked with such high-end objects as a piece of cardboard from a toilet roll or a hollowed out ball point pen. The rubber surface where the lock comes in contact with the notebook is definitely a plus, won't be doing any damage to your notebook. The lock itself again, feels and is strong.

5450,"Very well worth the money. I ordered these because of their sound isolation feature.  These come with a small carry case that I like to bring around along with my iPod.  And they also come with 9 different earplugs for you to customize.  They have 3 different kinds of plugs each with 3 sizes.  They have clear plastic ones, soft black plugs, and foam plugs.  I find the clear plastic ones to be way too hard so i tried the black ones which i used for a while and then tried the foam ones.  Boy can I tell you, the foam earplugs are genius.  They don't look as cool but they work exactly like earplugs.  you roll them up and then put them in your ear and they expand to fill your earhole and you pretty much don't hear anything except for your music.  The foam ear pieces are by far the best ones they have to offer in my opinion.  Other than the superior sound isolation, the sound quality from these are amazing.  I own sennheiser pc150s paired with x-fi sound card and they aren't nearly as good as the e2g's with my ipod.

The surround-sound wireless connection is flawless, and the setup is nice and neat with no cables getting in the way--and of course, the sound quality is superb. The one problem I have, which took me a while to figure out, is not really a problem with this system in itself. I use a Linksys wireless router and network card, which both run at the same frequency (2.4 GHz) as the wireless speaker connection. Turns out when I have the speakers on, my wireless connection to my router gets blocked most of the time. I verified this several times by switching my speakers on and off.

My only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap.

I love how the display shows the notes.  The ONLY minor complaint so far is that it defaults to the loudest setting.  If it defaulted to the lowest setting it'd be perfect,0
5465,"Uniden TRU8885-2 5.8 GHz Cordless Phone. I've gone through many cordless phones and the change to this one was due to interference on my wireless network from a 2.4GHz phone. The interface is the most user friendly of all the phones I've had. Especially simple is accessing call waiting and creating a conference call. The bright orange display is easy to read and it's a cinch to program in numbers. The answering machine, self-contained in each handset and on the base station, is easy to program and has a very clear sound. Highly recommended",0
5466,"This thing is great!. It's simple, easy to use, versitile and unobtrusive.  Instead of carrying a big folder of CDs, I have a tiny folder of SD chips with ALL of my 4000 songs of music. I like have different chips better than an ipod in the car since its easier to deal with",0
5467,"superb case.... I recently bought a second gen nano, and was looking for an acrylic case to keep it safe.  It is sturdy, and the clickwheel covering is awesome (it's thin molded acrylic so no dirt can get in).  This is an absolute must-have if you use the ipod+nike running attachment.  It plugs easily into the nano without having to take the cover off.  Sure, there is no armband or beltclip but I just tuck it into the front pocket of my winter shell. The caribiner clip is a nice touch.  Overall, it's $20 well spent",0
5468,Great remote for TIVO units!. I bought this to replace a lost Tivo series 2 remote control. Worked right out of the environmentally unfriendly plastic packaging,0

5470,"Great headphones!. I bought these because I was trying to find some headphones that would not fall out of my ears.  These are the only ones that I have found that will stay in my ears while I am running.  They are also very durable.  When my last pair fell out of my ears and hit the pavement, they broke instantly.  While running with my new Jensens the other day, a neighborhood dog ran out to greet me.  He jumped up on me (affectionately) and accidentally yanked them out of my ears.  They got jerked around by the dog as he was tangled in them and they hit the pavement, but they still work perfectly!  I definitely recommend them!",0

5472,"Good Deal for The $$$, Works Great Overall. We purchased these to replace a forever defective Motorola set. Initially we had issues with the phones cutting out in the middle of calls - but that seems to have subsided and they work just fine. We use vonage - Voice Over IP and they work great with that. A great deal for the money!!",0
5473,"Great Bluetooth Headset. I purchased the system because I wanted a headset that would work with my office phone as well as with my Treo 650.  Installation was fairly straightforward.  I also purchased the online indicator light, which is helpful when someone walks into your office unaware that you are on the phone and starts talking to you.The system has clear sound, plenty of volume, excellent range for Bluetooth, and the headset is comfortable to wear.  I wear it all day long (except when I'm in a client meeting or otherwise do not wish to look like a geek), and charge it for about half an hour or so with the included A/C charger when I get home.Be aware that there are limitations to using the headset with the cell phone.  The Bluetooth radio of the Treo isn't as powerful as the Plantronics base unit, so the range and ability to communicate through solid objects are reduced.  Also, answering an incoming call using the phone works well, but I haven't quite mastered the process of answering the call with the headset button yet.  Still, I'm pleased with the overall performance of this headset with the Treo, and it's smart enough to be able to use with both phones at the same time",0
5474,"Great value for a sturdy, easy-to-install mount. I read the Amazon customer reviews on this wall mount, and decided to check it out. I am glad I did! I have a 32"" WinBook LCD, and installation was a snap. The tv looks great, and I am really happy with the articulation. I installed it at night and kept waiting to hear a crash before morning, but this arm is extremely sturdy. It is also adjustable for leveling the display; this is good because even though it is perfectly level on the wall, apparently the plate that mounts to the display is not squared, but I was able to easily compensate. I recommend this to anyone who wants to be as cool as me",0
5475,XM Antenna. I have two of these antenna's. I have two different XM radios in my house and these antenn'a work great. In my location I didn't have to get to the South side of my house to get good reception. Great product at a great price,0
5476,"D-Link is tops. I had been using a Belkin F5U021 4-Port hub. My computer was constantly reporting Low USB power, I'd have to unplug something to get something else working. Since I replaced it with the D-link. No more Low USB messages; No more un-plugging.As a matter of fact I had previously replaced my LinkSys router (which I had to reset from time to time) with a D-Link. I've never had to reset the D-Link.Obviously, D-Link makes very good products.I highly recommend D-Link products",0
5477,"Pretty good... I just got this device a few days ago.  I have to agree with the reviewer that you will need to put up with a little hiss/pop on occasion but I'm ok with this.  I love the size and the ability to just unplug it and take it in the house.I too use a Sirius FM transmitter and love the quality.  I guess I never noticed how good it was till it was mentioned here.  I do, however, wish it had the same ""preset"" features that the Belkin TuneFM does, that's a fantastic feature.One small annoyance I had with the Belkin is when you sometimes press a button on the device, it causes the audio on your ipod to pause for a second.  It's not a big deal, just something I noticed.Overall I like it.  I've only had it for 2 days though, we'll have to see how well it holds up",0
5478,"Very Very good Sound. First of all, I have been an audiophile since age 8. I am 51 now. I own a 35K Krell audio system, for those in the know. I cannot tolerate sound that is not accurate and I must say, these spealers are very accurate for two channel. I would give them  5 stars if it were not for the price. The surround is just a plus for me as music in my main concern. When I connected this up per instrution, I was up all night listning to  jazz.Don't get me worong, in no way can this system sound as good as my Krell setup, but I can at least listen to them, which is more than I can say for most computer speakers I have hears with their boomy bass",0
5479,"Great value for cost. You can't go wrong with this little adapter.  I am using it on my iBook G4, for audio input (microphone).  It works just fine.  I looked at a number of other items which were more pricey and had cords to mess with.  This adapter plugs right into the usb port and you mic or headphones plug into it.  It works great for my needs.  I've also checked it out with headphones, and it works fine.  I recommend this item.",0
5480,"Works well - may need to order another tip for your device. Excellent robust design.  If going to a no-electricity place, this is an ideal way to charge your electrical device (provided there is access to sunlight).  It's a bit expensive but the quality is obvious.  My unit did not have the tip for my cell phone so it had to be ordered (more expense).  Folds up and easy to carry.  If going on an extended trip to the woods and you need your radio, phone, or gps, this is the ticket",0
5481,"Not a bad piece of hardware. I was given a Zune as a gift, recently. This isn't the first MP3 player I've owned but it's the one with the largest capacity to store data that I've owned. Up front I'll tell you that I'm not a hardcore iPod junkie, nor am I an Apple kiss-butt. I believe in products that work. That being said I can see why people prefer the iPod over the Zune, though I will say that the Zune isn't deserving of some of the bashing I've read on these boards from people who believe it's cool to bash Microsoft products just because they were made by Microsoft.The Good1. The Zune has a large, bright LCD screen that can be easily seen in sunlight. Video and picture quality are good.2. The sound quality is good. The factory earphones are adequate in delivering music though I have a pair of Philips earphones that are far superior and only cost $20.3. The box includes a data cable you need for syncing.4. The interface is super easy to use and it is easy to get around in the Zune environment and I've not had any of the music skipping problems with the 1.3 firmware that was automatically downloaded when I synced to my PC.5. The unit itself feels solid when held, and slightly heavy though not too heavy.6. The software loaded without a problem on my WinXP SP2 system and I had no problem syncing to the machine when connected to a USB port at the rear of the PC. I had all of my non-ITunes songs added to the player within minutes.7. The Zune allows you to beam songs, pictures and movies to other Zune players in range.For a first generation player, it gets the job done nicely and I look forward to seeing what generation 2 will bring.The Not So Good1. When I connected the Zune to a 4 port USB hub the PC didn't recognize it was there. I had to connect it to the back of the PC to a USB 2.0 port in order to get it to work. Maybe that's by design, though I'm not sure. Once I did this I had no syncing problems at all.2. I've never found another Zune in range to share anything. Leaving the wireless on seems to drain the battery faster. I'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy the Zune (if that happens).3. You can't buy music or movies wirelessly.4. Although the Zune has wireless it is not compatible with your home or business wireless LAN.5. You can't browse the internet with the Zune.6. The Zune software has no problem getting your music onto the device, though the Zune Marketplace is vastly understocked compared to the ITunes music store.7. The Zune cannot get music purchased through ITunes (this is nitpicky, I know, but would be so nice). There is a way to work around this - you can burn your ITunes songs to a disc and then turn around and rip the disc to the PC as MP3s and then import them to the Zune, which I would rather do than pay money to re-purchase music I've already bought once.8. There's no way to re-organize files on your Zune once they are uploaded to the device. Say for example I want to throw a couple of pictures into a picture folder so that when I view my pics I don't have to scroll down forever and a day to see them. I have to delete the pic from the Zune through the PC software, add the pic to the folder I want and then sync the PC to the player. The folder had to have been added to the Zune library in order for the update to occur.9. There's no way to change the orientation of photos or movies when viewed. I would like to be able to flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees to view them in portrait view instead of turning the player on its side to view in landscape mode. One reason why this is important is when I set one of my pics as my Zune background, I'd like to be able to see just how much of the pic will be cut off since the Zune doesn't resize the pic to fit. Oh yeah, that's another thing...10. Pics used for the Zune background don't have an option to be re-sized to fit the screen.What I Would Like to See Change on the Zune (more for Microsoft than anyone else)1. Options for re-sizing pics to fit the Zune screen2. Options for changing the orientation of pics and movies3. The ability to organize my files in the Zune without having to delete the file and re-sync. I'd like to be able to do this from the player and from the software both.4. Since I have to use the USB port on the back of my PC a longer sync cable would be nice.5. Put the built-in wireless to good use. Slap in compact Internet Explorer and allow viewing of web pages and email! You don't need a keyboard to view read-only content like weather, news and sports and it would really add to the player's value6. Allow the Zune to be able to buy music, pics and video without having to connect to the PC. Again, make use of the wireless capability of the Zune.7. Do something about the Zune Marketplace - it just needs an overhaul. It needs additional music, movies and a definite bump in the cool factor.8. Make it easier to customize the outside of the Zune. You did this with additional and customizeable faceplates for the XBox 360 - do the same for this player. If you hadn't noticed - individuality is in and is here to stay",0

5497,"Best of current crop. I think this is about the best of the current crop (end of year 2005) of dual tuner video cards. However, I am still looking forward to the next generation as this card and many in the same category have somewhat ""mushy"" video, slightly washed out color. This particular model has audio problems on some channels about 5% of the time, so recorded shows are sometimes not watchable. New drivers did not help. You can only use one type of video input at a time: either the 2 tuner coax inputs or the 2 A/V inputs (this is probably a limitation of MCE, not the card itself). It installed flawlessly and setup in Windows MCE was effortless -- perfect score on this count. The FM tuner works well, however for some reason you can't listen to FM while tuning a channel/recording (could be an MCE limitation again). Overall I love this card, but as I said, very anxious to see what the next gen offers",0

For the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers. Yeah! On the negative, I don't really understand why they skimp out on the DVD side of things- I mean my $200 pioneer handles the range of DVD's much better. Of greatest concern for me though has been voice re-production. Voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds, and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem, it doesn't do a very good job. Consequently, it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and DVD's. Also, just a small note, to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud (so if you don't care too much for neighbours that won't be a problem). Overall, my music sounds crisp and I love hearing every little noise in my music, so I still have a smile on my face.",0

All in all, I am very pleased with this speaker system",0
5515,"Nice bag. I gave it five stars b/c I got exactly what I expected to get.  Everything fits in it but there is very little extra room, I wanted that.  The ergonomic handle is comfortable.  I would not have chosen this bag when I was executive because it doesn't have the professional polished look.  It is a casual looking bag, which is also what I wanted.  I like the orange detail - it is not too much.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is that it seems heavy to me when everything is in it.  Since my new laptop is lighter/smaller than the previous one, I do suspect it's the bag that adds the weight.  I am overall very happy with the bag though",0
5516,"great TV card and easy to use software. I use this card to record DIY channels and hockey games. The picture quality is pretty good. I used to have it on windows XP pro but now it's running on Media Center Edition.

Otherwise, you'll get an error, ""Failed to create TV Window. hTV=0x3fa1f8 Err=8"". Your hex address might be different than mine.I hook up a VCR to convert VHS into digital as well.The only negative thing about this card is the picture gets super white when content is bright in a large area. Watching ice hockey would be an example since the ice is really white, the details such as the puck and players would get ""brighten"" up as well and blend into the ice. So to fix that, you have to lower the brightness and contrast but that would effect other viewings like movies and shows",0

5521,"I Love This Table !. I certainly don't know what the other reviewers expected...it's a T.V. Tray for Chrissake ! That said, I love this thing. First the basics: Pros: Lightweight, Very easy to adjust, Folds flat for easy storage. Cons: Ugly. Wish it came in ""designer colors."" A bit expensive given the materials and design...Actually I just bought my second Tablemate II (at Bed, Bath & Beyond) after having my first one about a year. This way I can put a large art book on one and my laptop on the other and angle them accordingly for easy reference. The TMII places my laptop at the perfect angle for writing long essays and now, my dissertation. Some people here complain that it bends after heavy use, but I haven't encountered this despite setting various very heavy things on it over the course of a year. I really like it more than I thought I would (It looked pretty cheesy on T.V. and even in person at BB&B). I gave it a try and am more than satisfied. It slides up very close to me even if I am sitting in a deep chair. I tried a similar tray from Walgreens but it was super heavy and had a profile that did not allow it to be pulled in as close. Plus, the Walgreens' one was made of out pressboard coated with contact paper that looked very cheap and like it would disintegrate with the first good cleaning. Also, it would only support 15 pounds. The Tablemate II is very easy to clean, and thus, I bet it would be great for kids too. In short it works for all of my needs and I can only imagine that the other people here thought they were buying something more high-fallutin than a T.V. Tray. It is what it is. And it is a huge improvement design-wise over those trays of yore with their bad, pseudo-Fantin-Latour flower stencils and spindley, X-crossed, faux-gold-toned aluminum legs my parents had! I am in my comfy chair and using it as a support for my laptop right now as I type this !",0
5522,PNY does it again!. My family is one of avid gamers.  NCsoft had an update to their City of Heroes Game(which we love) that was more graphically intense for my old PNY Geforce4 Ti 4200 could handle (a great workhorse of a card).I thought I was going to have to update my motherboard to go to the new PCI-e slot to get a graphics card that would be able to handle the demands of the game.I saw this and decided it was worth the try and with no remorse what so ever this card weas bought and is working so beautifully that my desktop that is 4 years old still performs as good if not better than the Dell XPS notebook I purchased for portable game play.To say the least this card can breath life into older systems still running the AGP GPU configuration.  Highly recommended.  The drivers were a little tricky to install from the nVidia website. You will need to unpack them.  The Autoexec. for the nvida Drivers didn't detect the card so using the Device manager update the drivers telling Windows where the folder created by the nVidia drivers is located and you are running up to speed.Graphics a beautiful and fast.  Workiing across 2 monitors is nice as well. I am able to play a DVD on the TV and game at the same time without so much as a hickup.GO for this card,0
5523,"great product for great price. It works realy great, I red some other reviews before buying this product and I can only say that this product is preaty fast and does realy works and for the price I paid its even more than enought to say that its just awsome. great delivery time.",0
5524,"this is the product you are looking for. if you don't want to spend a ton of money and you want the  best quality possible.  i am using the ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my DirecTV DVR onto DVD.  The quality is outstanding.2 quick complaints, but really these are only minor things:1)  setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure.  the message should have said....""MAKE SURE THE USB CABLE IS PLUGGED IN DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOTHER BOARD""....in other words, in the back of your computer and with a USB port that came with your computer instead of an add on.  easy enough fix, but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple.2)  on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video.  This has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise, but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100% pure video with no errors.this is a great product....don't look any where else",0
5525,"Very good reception and easy to operate. I am reasonably impressed with the reception abilities of this radio, especially after reading some of the reviews here.  I live in the SW burbs of Omaha and can get 13 HD stations (one of them is even AM).The radio is very easy to operate, in fact I have yet to unseal the manual.  Comes with a standard FM dipole antenna and an AM loop antenna, which I am using for my antennas.I haven't used it as a clock radio very long yet, so I can't comment on the long term accuracy of the clock section, but it seems to be good so far.The only two features I would would have liked to find and did not on this radio are an equalizer for the radio sound and a scan / auto-station load into preset feature.  Other than those two (minor IMHO) additions, I think the radio performs well and is priced accordingly",0
5526,the coolest cd player!!!. i am a hello kitty fan and when i this i begged my mom to take me 2 get it. the cd player is very cool and the headphones are so cute but they are not very durable.the anti-skip thing works very well beacause i droped this on the floor nothing happend! most of my freinds think it's ''funny'' that i LOVE hello kitty but i don't care. anyway you should really buy this 4 your daughter or 4 youself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
5527,"Well worth it. I have been using a Minolta S414 digital camera. The batteries that came with it were only 1600 mAmps. I never got through an entire ballgame without having the batteries run dry. Of course I carried a spare set, but this was less than ideal. I got these 2000 mAmp Monsters and I must say they deliver what they promise. As a result, I've really not needed the backup set, even when shooting games that went into extra innings! The charger is well made, very quick and has easy LEDs to see the charge status from across the room. Overall, this has been a great purchase",0
5528,"great after you figure it out. i read all the reviews about this one and was prepared for a tough software install.  It isn't tough so much as a bit of a drudgery until you get everything JUST EXACTLY RIGHT.  I have a Samsung 40"" lcd, older AV system (stereo only not surround), DVD recorder that I also use as a 2nd channel for PIP and to play movies of course, Motorola STB, 50 disc Sony CD changer, and a optoma projector i use maybe twice a month for movies or something on the 8 ft. screen.Anyway, in 20 minutes I had it all working, OK, but just OK.  The software allows you to do things like turn volumes up and down on devices, decide on the starting channel, pick your own shortcuts for the LCD screen and much much more. After about two hours I had it about perfect.  The next day i tweaked some of my shortcuts based on my experience.  So the ease of installation was only about a 4 (and I'm a technical gadget guy).  But the performance is astounding.  I put 5 old remotes in a drawer and it's just as advertised.  A fanastic purchase at $104 and worth the steep, one time only, learning curve",0
5529,"great to have spare battery!!. The camera goes through battery like crazy, so I got a spare one and I keep one charged at all times and it has came in handy several times. If you have this type of battery I highly recommend that you have a 2cd one. Its well worth it!",0

I installed this Eagle Aspen 4X8 and can now supply both tuners on 2 DVRs as well as 4 additional single tuner recievers without diminishing picture quality.  Make sure you run all 4 outputs from your satellite into the multiswitch, otherwise you will not be able to acquire all channels.  This switch can be mounted indoors or outdoors and cost about $100 less than the ones available at the big box stores and the install instructions include a Technical HelpDesk Phone Number.",0

5536,"Exactly what I needed for working out... I did plenty of research before buying this item.  I was looking for a holder for my iPod specifically for working out and this works great.  My arms are not huge by any means and you can adjust the size easily with the velcro strap.  It has never slipped off or gotten loose on me yet.  The plastic overlay has never given me any trouble when adjusting volume or changing menus while working out on an elliptical machine.  The ONLY problem I have with it is the headphone jack.  I had to take a knife to the armband to cut a small hole so it matches up to where the jack is on the iPOD.  Even that has not torn, ripped or fraid from the incision I made.  Highly recommended it",0
5537,Excellant buy. I love my Nikon CoolScan V. It set up just great and started cranking out excellent scans right away. I think they must of fixed the problem with scanning Kodachrome in the Nikon Scan software because most my scans are Kodachrome dating back to the late sixties. There are a few inconvenient software items but nothing you can't deal with. Kodachrome slides can't use the dust and scratch eliminator. For the price there is nothing as good as the Nikon CoolScan V. I am running the scanner on a PC with Windows XP Pro.,0
5538,"Good Webcam for the price. Purchased this webcam about 9 months ago. It was difficult to setup but once I got it working it is really quite amazing. I also experienced the frequent lock ups which would require unplugging the webcam in order to reset it - a problem if you have this installed in a remote location. DLink has released a new downloadable (www.dlink.com) firmware upgrade for the webcam. Since I have installed this firmware release (ver 1.02), I have not had any lock up problems. For the price, this webcam has the best feature set out there",0

5544,"A ""Must Have"" Addition to Your Sketchup Workstation. I bought this gizmo specifically for use with Sketchup. I am happy to report that the SpaceNavigator's ""six degrees of freedom"" functionality truly augments and extends SU's navigation commands. My favorite feature is *roll*, which enables you to make your SU model pirouette like a ballerina. Try doing that with SU's *orbit* command! However, be forewarned: if you use SU 6 you'll have to download the latest driver. Also, SU elements such as trees that have a high polygon count do tend to create significant lag in the SpaceNav's screen rendering. But, hey - when I turn my trees off, SpaceNav simply flies! Last, but not least, this input device is well crafted, handles well, and will look great on your desk. :",0

The clip wont turn or come off the case, but the clip stays on your belt very tightly.

Anyway, I'll recomend this case to anyone who has a nano, white or black",0
5548,"Decent card for your budget. Installing the card is a bit tricky. You have to install the driver first, then insert the card into the PCI slot. For some reason, the first PCI slot didn't work on my computer. I had to uninstall it and try another PCI slot, and the card was recognized by Windows. However, the monitor port on my computer is right above the antenna jack, so the antenna can't assume the upright position that is required for this card to work! Imagine that! After much agony, I decided to buy a flexible external antenna and replace the tiny antenna that comes with the card. It finally worked. Now I think about it, I may need a third-party external antenna anyway, because the AP is really very far from my computer. After all, this card works like it should and is really inexpensive, despite all the hassels I had to go through",0

The polyphonic ringtones are nice and the answering machine is easy to use.  It doesn't beep to let you know if there is a message but it blinks.  I think it would have looked nicer to have a green digital display instead of an amber one but overall, a great phone",0

In fact, the ""Ultra II"" title does live up to its name, and am very happy with the performance of this product.  Canon 350D takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode, and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace, even at the highest resolution.  Download is speedy, too.I went for two 512MB cards instead of a single 1GB card, for redundancy (keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer), and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason.Highly recommended",0

5555,"Bose Rules. I am sorry to see the negative reviews on this board.  I have had Bose speakers for more than thirty years.  My first set, a pair of 601's is still functioning in a friends house.  My 901 series VI blow away any home theater systems I've heard.  With the direct reflecting sound, there is no need for center channel, rear channel.  You just get realism in the listening experience that is unmatched.  I have two sets of Acoustimas AM-5's and I am totally satisfied.  I've had one set since 1991 and that is a tribute to the quality and longevity of the product.  I purchased a second set when I finished my basement and they are nothing short of awesome.  When I entertain, I almost always get a compliment on the sound of the speakers.  Other reviewers have commented on the lack of bass.  I would just say that you really do have to pay attention to the placement of the subwoofer.  Bose intends for the subwoofer to use the floor as a platform to send the bass throughout the room.  Placing the subwoofer nearer to the corner of the room sometimes will increase the bass.  I have both of my systems set up with the subwoofer in a corner firing out at a 45 degree angle and the rooms are totally filled with deep rich bass.I have always preached the gospel of putting your money in a good set of speakers.  While your other equipment is important, the speaker system will make or break the quality of your sound.  But with any speaker system, you have to finesse the placement for optimal results.",0

It is pretty easy to operate and we keep it in the box it came in while she watches it (just leave the screen open and slide it back into the box, I made a little slit for the cord) that way she cant play with the buttons or put her feet on it. :-)  All in all, so far so good and it was a good price",0

5559,"A great value in a $1000 HDTV. I have owned this TV now for about one week. I was going to wait longer to post a review, but since there are none up here, I thought it would be useful to potential buyers to have it now.I bought this TV for my mother as a gift and my budget was $1000. For that amount of money the HDTV choices were: 27"" to 37"" 720p LCD; 32"" to 35"" CRT- based sets; and a few 40-42"" DLP sets. Given that the set was for a living room, size was an important priority. So that meant examining most seriously the DLP options.Most DLP sets I looked at in the stores had a pretty decent image when viewed straight on, but like most other rear-projection TVs, rapidly fell off in brightness when viewed off axis. One exception was a 56"" Toshiba DLP set which looked better than the others. Try as I might, I was unable to find the 42HM66 in a store, but what finally convinced me to buy it sight-unseen, was the Consumer Reports article which had Toshiba sets taking all of the top positions in the December 2006 ratings of DLP TVs. Though Consumer Reports did not evaluate DLP TVs smaller than 50"", I noted that the 42HM66 was of the same series number as one of the best-rated Toshiba sets. So I decided to take a chance. Next the results.Having viewed it about 20 hours I have to say the picture is truly excellent for a 720p set. Colors are bright and the screen has a difficult-to-describe luminous liveliness absent from my new 40"" Samsung LCD. Outdoor HD nature programming is particularly stunning. A nice surprise was the good off-axis performance. Though straight-on is still best, the image is quite bright out to about 45 degrees from perpendicular, much better than most other DLPs I have seen! Consumer Reports rated the larger Toshiba DLP sets with their highest picture quality rating. I would second that high rating for the 42HM66, it truly delivers the goods. I prefer its picture to that of my new Samsung LCD, which is also 720p, not the latest 1080p, and the Samsung cost 40% more. Image quality = a well-deserved 5 stars.Where the 42HM66 shows its limitations is in the sound subsystem. The speakers are weak with little bass response. When using digital input sources one needs to turn it up nearly all the way. Analog channels don't seem to have this problem. So when switching between analog and digital sources, one often needs to step the volume up and down, a recurring annoyance. I think most would find the sound performance seriously lacking, but this is easy to fix if you have a stereo receiver or AV sound system to plug into using the available line-out jacks. Sound quality = 2 stars.Now for convenience and user-friendliness. It is equipped with only one HDMI jack, so if you want to plug in 2 digital sources, like an upconverting DVD player and an HD cable box, you will have to plug one into the component or S-video input; but for a price of only $1000 this is not surprising.The TV was also not quite as simple to setup as my recently purchased Samsung. The auto-program feature was difficult to find, so if you are giving it as a gift to a technically-challenged person, make sure they get some help. I found the remote disappointing for it had small equally-sized buttons and the control layout was not very intuitive. But once you learn how to get into the menus and where things are, it becomes acceptable. Sadly it could be so much better with just a few minor changes. Kudos to Samsung for their excellent remotes. User friendliness = 3 stars.Now for the bottom line. I didn't expect the 42HM66 to be perfect all around, but in the one area which counts most... picture quality... it is a top-notch performer. Weak sound is easily remedied and the remote works OK once you learn it, but a bad picture cannot be fixed in any way. This is a GREAT choice if you need 40+"" in screen size and don't want to sacrifice image quality on a budget of only $1000. My mother is simply blown away by the picture and I am VERY happy with this purchase... and Amazon's free shipping made it just that much better. The set has yet to accumulate serious viewing hours, so I will not comment on its reliability, but if I run into problems down the road I will revisit this review. For now... my bottom line overall rating: A solid 4-1/2 stars.P.S. The free Amazon shipping via Eagle was great. They called in advance,  came when they said they would, were courteous, and the package was delivered in excellent condition. Kudos. I felt like giving them a tip :)",0

5563,"Very Good!!!. Just like every other review about this radio.  It's packed with all the features that listeners need to have like PLL tuning, direct keypad frequency entry, scan tuning, memories tuning, LCD backlid,....and the powerful Synchronous Detection Circuit.  This AM mode feature would LOWER the distortion due to fading from weak receptions and EXTRACT the adjacent broadcast stations to get a clear/better reception, using the SYNC mode and either LSB/USB switch.EX: I am listening to Voice of Vietnam at 6175 kHz, using a Kaito KA2100 or the Mini Kaito KA11. Sometimes I'd get a clear reception, but most of the time I have a mixing reception with beats, and the 2 adjacent stations are the Radio Netherland at 6165 kHz and the Radio Havanna Cuba at 6180 kHz.  These 2 stations are so strong to interfere the reception of the Voice of Vietnam station even if they are not tuned in on the display, and even if I use PLL tuning (no drifting). Now, With the Sync Detection feature on the Sony 7600GR, I can easily eliminate those interferences by switching to Sync and LSB or USB, and I can enjoy listening again.Way to go, Sony!",0

5569,"Superb, unique, Treo 650 + Deskphone Bluetooth Solution!. I talk on a landline or on a Treo 650 all day from my home office.  I've been using a Palm Treo headset for Treo calls, and my Treo wired headset for landline calls on a 5.8 Ghz Panasonic cordless phone, surrounded by 2.4 Ghz wireless internet signals.  While this setup works, issues are (a) I am tethered to the desk (and often tangled and dropping the cordless handset), (b) switching headsets is a hassle (I did not try wearing both headsets on separate ears--too confusing and I want one ear available for the local environment), (c) landline callers often complain that they hear an ""echo"" of their voice on the Treo wired headset, (d) and the extra step of having to plug my Palm headset into its charger (and its lack of a low battery indicator) results in having to recharge it when I need to be using it.My ideal solution would enable me to answer calls on either phone with a single headset, keeping my hands free for working on my computer, un-tether/untangle me so I can move around my office and home, and provide a convenient recharging stand for the headset (like the Jabra JX10).  My functional priorities:  (1) 2-way voice clarity, (2) wearing comfort and stability to stay on my ear, (3) range.  Cool style/design is not a significant factor.I stumbled on the Plantronics 510 headset, which has a seemingly unique ""multi-point"" technology enabling it to pair to two phones at the same time.  On-line research revealed a seemingly well-designed desk phone adapter with an integrated a headset holder/charger. The value of the optional ""handset lifter"" was hard to assess without seeing it working.  But the entire system is expensive ($399 list on the Plantronics site, $300 at other retailers), and it requires a wired desk phone--it's not compatible with a cordless, due to the way it connects to a wired handset.  However, I know Plantronics is a manufacturer of serious office headset solutions, so I figure you get what you pay for.  I read some reviews (few available, not even listed on the Treonauts site), found it on the web for $210, and ordered it to test it out.Well, I've only been using it 3 days, but it is superb!  I dusted off an old wired desk phone (keeping the cordless with programmed numbers to place calls), plugged everything together, paired to my Treo easily, kept all the default hear/talk volume settings, charged the headset - and started placing/answering calls -- flawlessly!On talk quality, even my critical, hard-of-hearing friend had no complaints.  On listen quality, I raised the hear volume switch on the base one notch, and now it's perfect.  And the handset lifter is awesome!  I dial the call on the cordless, then press the call button on the headset; the handset lifts and you hear the call going through; I hang up the cordless.  Range-wise, I can walk upstairs to the kitchen to refill my coffee, step outside to greet the fedex man, and *almost* get the mail - which is about 70 feet from the base station!  Conservatively it looks like I will get a good solid 30 feet, through walls, with no quality loss (though still only about 10 feet if I'm talking on the Treo).  And a nice feature:  if I *do* go out of range, a low tone indicates this--without dropping the call--and a high tone let's me know I am back in range and resumes the call!To receive a call on either the Treo of the landline, I just touch the call button on the headset, which is conveniently centered on my ear.  Once you set the listen volume to a good level, this is the only button you really need to touch, and it is easy to ""find"".  And comfort-wise:  VERY comfortable!  The over-the-ear design keeps the headset feeling solidly in place; the smallest earpiece fits snugly in my ear, but absent is the pressure of other earpieces I've used (gels & 'hard' earbuds) .  I can hardly feel its weight on my ear, and there is *no* pressure inside my ear; I can easily wear it all day.  When I take it off, I stick it right into its holder/charge - so it's always charged up!The packaging could use one very small improvement:  the headset eartip guide could use some verbal description, to complement the diagrams, for selecting/fitting the right eartips, and for removing them from the headset as you try on the 3 different sizes.I am a careful, discerning technology consumer, and am aware that the real proof of satisfaction comes after weeks of use--not hours or even days.  I save all packaging to return a product that does not perform to expectations.  I can tell you that I am already confident that the 510SL is a keeper!  I will post updates to this initial review in a couple of weeks",0

It's easy to carry around, looks nice, protects my computer and has a front pocket in which I can place my computer wires and other such things",0
5571,Excellent well thought out product. This is a well thought-out design for a power strip.  I can fix 4-5 power adapters without wasting any other points.  Good build quality and sturdy cord to the wall.  The wall plug is 'bent' so that the thick wire runs parallel (instead of perpendicular) to the wall socket,0
5572,"Good Sound!!!. Great sound quality for the price.  You could buy the Sony MDR earphones for around $50, but this gives you the same sound quality for much less!!",0
5573,"Couldn't be happier!. I was unable to even find any male/female extension USB cables at my local bricks & mortar stores, and the male/male cables available cost an arm and a leg.These cables are extraordinarily low priced, arrived in the blink of an eye, fit perfectly, are of heavy construction, and work like a charm.I couldn't be happier",0
5574,"Great product. Software needs a bit improvement. I bought this a few months back, and I use it mostly for playing WoW.PROS: Very high quality product, strong enough to endure long keyboard-smashing combat sessions. The LCD is very useful if [like me] you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game, because it allows me to control iTunes whithout alt-tabbing out of the full-screen game. Macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites, and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your in-game action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard (I use flexbar with WoW).CONS: The software needs a bit of improvement: If I put my computer to hybernate, the software seems to hang when I bring it back up, and I can't use the macro keys, so I have to reboot or kill the software's process and restart it manually. The interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability (it forces me to use the mouse a lot, and i like being able to use the keyboard). Even though the LCD offers other posibilities [like displaying available ammo], I don't use most of them, because I can get most of these values from my game's UI and I dont have to look away from the monitor to do so.Overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming. Wouldn't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming",0

5579,"Good unit... is Up-Converting what you think it is?. I purchased this receiver for two reasons.  First HDMI in/out, and second for the ability to 'up-convert' non-hd components such as a TiVo Series 1 or 2 or a VCR.  While the receiver works great, I was sadly surprised that it doesn't actually upscale the signal from 480i to 1080i, which is what I really wanted.  Up-converting is basically the ability to change the cable output from S-Video or composite video to HDMI. I only just figured out that what I really wanted was an 'Upscaling' receiver (which is more $$$ of course). The quality out via HDMI at 480i is the same as if I had just kept an S-Video cable attached to the TV",0
5580,"Iogear KVM switch. This is my second Iogear KVM switch and both have worked perfectly. It is a great way to work between two computers with a single monitor , mouse and keyboard. Other brands have been very slow when switching between computers and have a difficult time with my 24"" Dell monitor (I would have to disconnect the KVM and connect the keyboard and mouse dirrectly to one of the computers, then reset the screen resolution and rehook up the KVM), but the Iogears are very fast with no glitches. Highly recommend",0
5581,"No Problems for the last 2 Years. I purchased this product over 2 years ago and have used it quite often in that time.  Initially, we used it in the car utilizing the headphone splitter so our two daughters could watch movies during our longer car drives.  No problems whatsoever.  After we upgraded our car to an SUV which included a built in DVD player, I began to use the player on my business trips which occur nearly every week.  I packed this player in my suitcase every week for over a year and have had no problems.  We have utilized the ability to send the video signal to a project about a dozen times, including my wife's parents anniversary party out of state and it has worked flawlessly every time.  Once in a while I will have to re-insert the DVD before the player ""sees"" it but this is no big inconvenience.  I also play various types of media, including DVD -R and CD's.  It is bizarre that so many reviews include such real problems",0
5582,"An excellent choice. I bought one of these in 1/07 and then another in 3/07 because I liked it that much. On its highest setting its too bright for working with text so there is a text setting and other modes to quickly adjust how bright and the screen is and the contrast for various modes of operation. It was an excellent choice at the time of purchase but Samsung has come out with their 2X6 series which seem to have better numbers at a steeper price. At the time I purchase the Acer it was between the 225WB. With the 226 replacing the 225 at the same price as 225w I would have looked into that. I would not use this monitor for anything other than horizontal viewing. I do not play games and movies are alright. The speakers are not worth the material they are made out of but its not something to consider when buying a monitor. The stand is as basic as you can get but putting a book under the stand works to raise it, though ghastly to look at.",0

I purchased this unit to upconvert by DVD output to my HD montior. However, it appears the electronics in my plasma monitor are just not compatible with the HDMI technology, just a year too old. The unit itself is surprisingly small and has ample connections. It produces a nice picture. A couple of things I find annoying: 1) the only way to get the disk out of the tray is to stick your finger in the center hole of hte dvd, there is no way to grab it from the side, 2) the time delay for the display to show that the unit is turning on or off can cause you to hit the button twice and then you turnt he unit on and off and you didn't want to",0

5586,"Excellent. A pile of bills and documents was waiting for me at home after a couple of months without a shredder, and after some careful consideration, I decided to buy this one. My positive impressions:- Size is ideal for home or small office- Cross-cuts the strips for added security- You can remove the bucket and empty it without unmounting the shredding unit (unlike my older shredder which was smaller)Basically, it is real easy to use and very secure. The only way I would give it fewer stars is if it breaks on me",0

The only other trouble I have had is quicky moving to the other folders and getting everything to work, but that could be my fault since I really haven't taken that much time to use it for anything else besides what I purchased it for and that is to listen to podcasts at work.  I hooked it up to little speakers and it works great for that purpose. I would recommend it.",0
5589,"Epson Velvet Art Paper is Fine. I have been taking photos since I was [...] and only recently began to take this once in a blue moon hobby to heart.  I went out and bought a new digital camera, learned how to use that, and then invested in an Epson Stylus Photo R1800 printer.  Although never trained, people say I have a good eye which I believe is true, or else I wouldn't bother.  I had been printing my photos on the Epson Luster photo paper and was very happy with the results, but wanted something softer and more artsy for the photos I chose to convert to watercolors.  I read the previous review on this type of paper and decided to give it a try.  I am overwhelmed with the results.  If you want good quality artistic photos, USE THIS PAPER.  When they first print out they are somewhat disappointing, but low and behold, as the paper and ink mesh - all I can say is OMIGOD!  Tremendous.  Buy it try it.

Also, I have two Sony DVD players, a PS2, and my roomies Zenith DVD player, none of which have a problem playing the discs.

And yes, occasionally a certain item or brand seems to have more problems than others. But that is the exception rather than the rule. The adage: ""you get what you pay for"" is far too vague a statement to be useful in all but the rarest of circumstances, a Plasma TV selling for $300.00 for example. In the case of this product, it doesn't apply. This media card is an excellent product at a terrific price. Companies like SimpleTech don't have huge marketing budgets, but that doesn't mean their products are any worse than the bigger players. If you want a good product and a great price, this one is hard to beat. We're not talking about cancer cures here...",0

I use the headphones with my i-pod and the computer and I listen to a huge barage of music and have to say that I am impressed",0
5601,Wow! Speaker sounds so good for $29.99!. Read some good reviews at Amazon.. Bought 2 pairs and tested them on my home amplifier. Plugged my Ipod in and played some music.  I couldn't believe what I'm hearing for the price I paid for.. Comparable to mid-to-high end speakers.  Good sounding highs and mid-bass for ceiling mount.  Tweeters worked so well that you can hear every detail of the music.  If you wanna go rap to house music.. just add a self-powered subwoofer! I would highly recommend this product,0

Much better sound than any earbuds.  Listened to the Pat Metheny Group Live tonight on Beyond Jazz with similar impressions.  These are great.  Can't wait to hear some Alan Holdsworth on them.

Also, one of the Velcro flaps on the top of the case covers the hold button on the Ipod.  The case takes away from the Ipod's good looks and slightly hinders usage of the buttons.  It doesn't do what I wanted it to do - stay out of the way and simply protect the MP3 player.  However, the case would be great to use just for jogging as it comes with a belt and clip that hold the Ipod firmly.",0

5617,"Excellent Quality for the Price. I have to agree with the two previous reviewers. For the price, these headphones are very good.The other reviewers just don't know what they are talking about. First of all, THERE IS a noice canceling effect. But noise canceling does not eliminate all sound, it makes certain sound frequencies less obtrusive or present, that's all. You will still hear what's happening around you. Just power the unit without any music playing and you will see the effect of the noise cancelling. It's does not seem much, but it does help on a bus, in the metro or a plane to drown out a bit the ambient noise.Of course, these aren't 300$ Sennheiser or Bose headphones. The Philips perform miserably compared to those. But for God's sake, they are under 30$ !Finally, they are comfortable. Make sure you you really insert the loops BEHIND the edge of your ears not just over, fiddle with the small-medium-large settings, and there you go. The cushioning is very comfortable.Overall, considering the LOW PRICE, you can't go wrong with these.",0

I plug amps, pre-amp, cd player into it and ground-loop hum is completely removed.  Also, due to componants operating at correct voltage, sound is quite noticably enhanced.  Better midrange, smoother treble, blacker background, more natural voicing and better dynamics.  I did notice that the low bass got a little more polite and lost some detail . . but for me it's worth it to have such big improvements in almost all other areas.  Highly recommended.  Plus it looks cool",0
5625,"Good purchase!. I bought two of these phones - one for me and one for my father.

I think they sound great.  I hooked them up as my main speakers just to test, and they sounded great as well.  Very crisp sound.  I have not noticed any ""holes"" in the sound as commented by other reviewers, and they are perfect for my home theatre.I can't comment on the bass module because I don't even use it, but I bet its not that great given how small and different it is from Bose's other more expensive bass modules.",0
5628,"A great value!. I bought this as a last-minute replacement for a 6-year old Sony DVD player that finally died.  I wasn't disappointed.  Setup was super-easy (although if you still have a regular TV, the default settings are for 16:9).  I'm using optical sound and S-Video, and the picture and sound quality are exactly what I expected - great.  Again, Sony has not let us down.  THe only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it takes a little while to cycle between discs",0
5629,"A Solution That Works. I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.)The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable.The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.",0

I just wish it had a 90 degree plug",0
5633,"Excellent Product. After using this product for 3 months I am yet to find something wrong with it. We have been using it with MS streets and trips. It works flawlessly. It gets a fix (cold start) in any setting - in urban canyon settings, at high speeds on the freeway, in wooded areas, inside my apartment. It even works if you keep it in the glove box of your car. We have driven through tunnels. It loses the signal a few meters into the the tunnel (not surprising) and gets a fix flawlessly with a couple of seconds of  leaving the tunnel.The software has no trouble communicating with the reciever. We have tried it with 2 different versions of MS streets and trips on three different laptops. With a basic knowledge of Bluetooth pairing the set up is a breeze.The battery life is exceptional.It comes with the complete kit a AC charger, a DC charger and a leather pouch. You can't ask for more.It's really compact (smaller than most cell phones) and not too heavy either.The other GPS reciever  that I have tried was a Delorme Eartmate. The delorme would never fixate signal when driving (cold start). We always had to pull over get a fix and then start driving. The Delorme always lost signal if you drove between 3 or 4 storey buildings. That can hardly be described as an urban canyon! It was horrible!",0
5634,"Nice phone, could be better. With a few drawbacks, this is a well-designed 4-line telephone. On the plus side, the base and remote handsets work well.  In particular, the remote handset buttons are much more sturdy than they were in earlier Panasonic design. Corded-handset and speakerphone quality are excellent. The major drawback is that the ring volume is the same for all 4 lines.  Previous Panasonic designs had individual-line volume settings, but not this phone.  This is important to me because only one of the 4 lines is for incoming calls, the others are for outgoing calls, and telemarketers call all lines indiscriminately.  My solution was to turn off the overall ring volume and use in parallel a separate cheap phone on the one line I use for incoming calls.  I do not use the answering system because I have voice mail, so I cannot comment on that feature",0
5635,"Good TV, great for the price. This TV has a lot going for it.Nice looks, good picture.  If you want to replace a 27"" tube TV, this is the set for you, as a 4:3 image is 27"" on this set (unstretched), and you won't damage it by watching black bars.  And of course filling the screen with movies and HDTV is gorgeous.Here are some of the many positives:+Strong Digital Tuner (brings in every digital channel in LA from a RadioShack table top antenna pointed through multiple walls!)+Amazing HDTV picture from that Digital Tuner+Many inputs means plenty of options (I have mine hooked up to my laptop via VGA, my satellite via RCA, and HDTV antenna via Coax)+Satellite hooked up over 50' RCA (composite) cable looks as clean as progressive DVD.  That means very good color decoder and scaler.+Good DVD upscaling, though I notice slight jaggies when compared to hooking up a computer set to the native resolution of the display and letting the computer do the scaling.  Considering how much more processing power a computer has, you can't fault the TV for that.  But if you have an HTPC, DVDs will look their best played through that.But there are minuses:-Red bias in color decoder means you have to turn color setting down below optimal to compensate.  Looks good, but could be better.  I may go into the service menu and see if this can be fixed manually.-Horrible Analog tuner.  Satellite sent over Channel 3, which looks great on other TV sets, looks bad on this set, but same picture sent via composite RCA looks amazing.-Fussy menus, could be more logical, functional.-No direct input addressing.-No direct Digital TV addressing.  You must use auto setup, which is time consuming, to add channels it missed if you didn't have your antenna pointed well.  Then you have to go back and delete the channels you don't want a second time.-Can't get black blacks without compressing the darks.  This is a typical LCD problem, though all the companies claim to have fixed it.  None seem to have yet.-Smart Stretch is pretty ""dumb"" in that it has a noticeable spot where the picture stretches.  Not fluid like the Panasonic Smart Stretch, and of course, some brands don't have it at all, but still could be improved.  After owning a Panasonic Plasma and setting up my sister's Panny Plasma and Panny LCD Projector, I know how Smart Stretch is supposed to look... ;)-Why is the remote so huge!!!  And why is it so limited in what it can operate?  You can program in Satellite tuners, for example, but not DirecTV or DishNetwork, the two largest US providers.  And why are some important buttons, like sleep, hidden behind a door and unlit?  The light button doesn't glow in the dark, and the Sleep button is unlit.  It's as if Sharp doesn't understand why a remote is lit to begin with.-Buttons on top of the set means if you have the set on top of a dresser or other tall piece of furniture, you can't see the buttons at all.  Would be better on the side of the set.But none of those minuses are worth looking elsewhere, as the Sharp outclasses all the others, especially at this price.So buy this TV for what it does best, and don't expect black blacks or a good analog tuner, and you'll be happy",0
5636,"a solid product. I have three of these, two at home and one at work. The black pad tends to get and/or look dirty, while the silver pads look good all the time. Very comfortable, nice support for the wrist. Could stand to have a little more mouse roaming space, but not a huge complaint. Good stuff",0
5637,"Saved my HD!. I recently purchased the Pacific Breeze Laptop Cooler and so far am very impressed with it.  Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the cooler for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate.  The reason that I was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps.  I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive!  Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at coolers.I choose this cooler after reviewing several of the ""mat"" variety, but chose this one because of its design.  As the previous reviewers have already mentioned, this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook.  This allows the CPU fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air.After setting this cooler up, I was feeling pretty good about the purchase.  Qualitatively, the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad, and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook.  Quantitatively, the notebook experienced a 5C temperature drop at my HD and at my CPU.  Now my hard drive is running at 40C-45C instead of 45-50C!I would definitely recommend this product",0
5638,I don't hear a difference but these things are well built!. My system always sounded great and used to use RadioShack's gold cable's.  I got these cause they were here on amazon where I bought my new dvd player.  These cables are a lot more hefty than anything i've ever seen.  I didn't compare quality to any other cables so I don't know about sound quality but it does sound good.  If you're like me you probably want to spend more time infront of the tv than behind it,0
5639,"It's called the Ultra Mini for a reason!. This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub.The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately.In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk",0
5640,"Correction To Earlier Review. It's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw -- beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power.  This person obviously didn't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the UPS.  The notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software.I agree that I was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem.  Luckily, it was easy to turn this feature off.Five stars for this product, for sure.",0
5641,"Great Find. This player is very user friendly. It is feather light, and holds days worth of music, I think I maxed it out with 20 full albums. It will play for a day or two on a little AAA battery. Records about 50 hours of voice or radio shows. I love the radio feature. Comes with a very functional leather carrying case and the best sounding ear buds I've ever heard. Not that I'm an expert on these things, but this is one cool little player",0

It also worked perfectly to transfer directly from VHSC tapes to DVD without transferring to computer.  Very simple set up and instructions.  The quality of the transferred videos was excellent!  You can also clip out parts of video seamlessly if you transfer to computer first very simply.  With the included software, you can do or add just about anything, music, frames, voice, etc.  No problems with the box getting hot or malfunctioning after over 4 hours of continuous use.",0
5645,It works!. I bought this to read my Smartmedia cards and it worked very well. As an added bonus it is also a nice looking product.

5646,"Outstanding Product - Best in Class. This is by far the best mp3 player I have owned or otherwise experienced.  The sound quality is second to none, and is fantastic with higher end headphones (I happily use the Ultimate Ears Super-Fi 5 Pro).  I previously owned the Creative Zen Vision M and several flash players and this was a significant upgrade.  I ruled out the iPod, Zune, and others because of a lack of Divx support.  I ruled out the Zen Vision W because the sound quality was significantly worse.Pros: Unparalleled sound quality, Divx compatibility, excellent battery life, very easy to use (my non-techie wife who hates most mp3 players loves it), good size (not much bigger than the Zen Vision M), nice included case, easy to transfer files (functions as a portable hard drive), can display documents, FLAC support, radio included, great sound effects features (BBE/custom EQ/etc), excellent screen.Cons: Processor could be faster, battery is not removable. Locks up once in a while, limited to 30GB (which can fill up fast).  All of the following are minor.My uses: I use this primarily as an mp3 player (65%) and to replay video (30%), and as a radio (5%).   All of those functions work well.  I have not used it as a recorder.Conclusion: if you travel significantly and want a great media companion then this is your product.  Easy to use, amazing audio and video quality, and hassle free.  At present, I cannot think of an ""upgrade"" to this that's available on the market (and I love to upgrade).  Not the smallest mp3 player, but really not much bigger than most full size players (I think the minor size difference is worth it - it still easily fits in a pocket)",0
5647,"Beautiful Phone. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the quality of this very beautiful phone. It's a bit heavy, which I liked, and the chrome phone looks very classy on the kitchen wall. The only drawback is the low ring, doesn't seem to ring any louder. Since we are on a farm, I need to me able to hear it from outside. Otherwise, it's a good buy and Amazon offers it at a much lower price than at other online stores",0
5648,great bag. I bought this for a friend who is a real estate agent.  It was a birthday present.  It was a larger than I expected.  I have to say she loved her present and I liked it so much I'm thinking of buying one for myself,0
5649,"Excellent for average person. I bought this item in March 2006 (cheap, don;t be afraid of refurbs). It makes excellent photolab quality pictures in about 1.5 to 2 minutes. The colors are clear and bright and you can have glossy or matte. If you are a big time photography nut, this may not be for you. If you are the average person who wants their pictures now instead of later this printer is great. Small enough to take with you on trips. I love it",0
5650,"Very good. A very good combination of price and quality. Long battery life. Good sound quality, almost no signal interruptions (sounds mostly like a corded phone). The only thing that really annoys me is that you can't change the ringer volume. It's too loud for me. But the volume of the sound is changeable and it's a good thing",0

5656,"Look No Further!!!  Really!!!!!!!!!!!. I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool.Absolutley buy this unit.  I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it",0

5658,"Knock on wood, a real bargain and great performer. OK...I know...there are a few folks out there that have had bad experiences with the LaCie Porsche units.  But....For the past two years my desktop has been occupied by a LaCie d2 120gb external. Last year I added an external LaCie LightScribe DVD burner and last month I added TWO of these 250gb Porsche Firewire externals to use as a RAID unit for file archive/backup.OK, they get WARM. I don't know what some of these people are talking about these units getting ""hot"". Mine are stacked too. Most electronics get warm.  Hell, my Powerbook gets so hot that it's almost too hot to have on your lap for a long time. These 250gb's only get mildly warm. Even after a back up of my iTunes Library which is currently over 90gb in size.Now, I won't dismiss the bad reports entirely. Since I am using the two 250's as a RAID unit for backup, they don't need to be running all the time. So if I am not doing an actual backup, they are kept switched off.I have had many years of experience with LaCie and have NEVER known them to put their name on crap.Considering that these are LaCie brand units and have a capacity of 250gb and are firewire drives AND they cost under $150 each, how can you complain",0

5661,"Superb sound quality at a great price. I purchased this card for my custom-built Home Theater PC (HTPC) running Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 and it sounds absolutely superb. M-Audio is known for their pro audio gear and the attention to quality can definitely be heard from this great card.I would give this card 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that currently there are no Vista drivers for this card. Also, this card is OLD. I believe this card was originally released in 2003. Not only that, M-Audio hasn't released an updated driver for this for a long time. The newest driver is from 2004.Although the card does not ""officially"" support XP Media Center, it works perfectly fine with the drivers for regular XP. I had a bit of a problem getting the digital output to work, but their superb tech support was able to provide all the info I needed. Currently I am using the single digital out cable to my receiver and it's outputting PCM, DTS, and dolby digital audio via the digital interface without any problems.One note of caution if you're using the digital output with XP Media Center Edition: turn off the media center interface sounds (you know, the annoying little sound effects from the buttons, etc.). The digital output can only send audio in one format at a time, so the following scenario can happen:If you are playing a DVD in DTS, raw DTS audio will go through the digital output. However, if you have sound effects on in Media Center, those are generated in PCM format. XP will send the audio in PCM format via the digital output. Going back to the DVD, you'll find that you get no sound because for some reason either XP doesn't switch the format back or the card doesn't see the change.If you are planning on running Windows Vista (which I don't recommend at least for a year till the bugs are worked out), then this won't work, but it's a great sounding card for XP",0

I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless.

I bought this from Amazon for $89.99 and am very happy with it.  You can get the MCM240 refurbished on the Philips website for around $40 if you are on a tighter budget.

I read the one review about using the glue - so when I put mine together, I put glue in the slot for the back, and believe me, I think they are wonderful! It went together in about 15 minutes (and then I let it sit for another 45 for the glue to dry) - took me longer to sort my DVD's than to put the cases together!

5673,"Unbelievable noise cancelling headphones. I have wanted a pair of the Bose headphones for years but could not justify the 350 dollar price tag.  I had tried the Sony 40 dollar noise cancelling  headphones  and the 90 dollar Shure in ear noise reducing headphones and was not impressed. I have just purchased and used the Sharper Image headphones which were on sale for 35 dollars, normally 70 dollars.  The fellow next to me on the plane had the Bose so I was able to do a direct comparison.  I would give the Bose a 10 in every category except cost, and the SI phones a 9 in every category except cost and value.  For cost and value this product earns a 10.  The noise reducing capability of the SI phones was outstanding and just about as good as the Bose.  You would be hard pressed to tell the difference in Noise reduction capability.  The Bose did have a slightly higher end sound quality  but the sound of the SI phones was extremely good.  If you can afford to spend 350 without batting an eye, get the Bose.  If not, then RUN and get the SI phones while they are still on sale.   Even at 70 dollars they are well worth it and they performed remarkably well on the airplane. They were extremely comfortable and I was continually impressed and delighted with this gem of a product. They are well designed and well made. I wore them for 3 hours straight on the plane with and was continually impressed. One little trick I discovered in using them on the plane was that if you manipulate the ear cups slightly, positioning them precisely over your ears, you can block out almost all of the engine sounds as they passively reduce the engine noise as well!  Final thought... a fantastic product.  Do NOT hesitate in buying these, you will not regret your purchase!",0

It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model.

One of the main reasons why I wanted a label maker was because of the tangle of cords associated with my home theater system.  With power cords for two game consoles, cable box, TV, DVD player, a Roku SoundBridge and a wireless bridge all plugged into the same power strip it was nearly impossible to figure out what I was unplugging at any given time.  Same went for the A/V cables connecting everything.  I made double-copy labels and folded one in half around every cable to make an easy-to-read tag, so now I know what every one is for without having to trace a wire from one end to the other through the rat's nest of wires behind the entertainment center.I also used it to label all the boxes and Rubbermaid bins full of stuff in the attic storage space, and labeled some more plastic storage bins in a few closets.The PT-80 features a full QWERTY-style keyboard that is easy to use, which is nicer than some other models that arrange the buttons in alphabetical order... I can two-thumb-type out any label in a matter of seconds.  I've read some complaints about wasted tape, but I've organized three rooms with dozens of labels (many of them double-ended cable tags as I described for my entertainment center) and still haven't used up the first 26' cartridge.  The little slot in the back of the device that helps peel the label end is nice, but doesn't work on the first time, every time... usually I have to put the end in and strip it back a few times before I can peel the label from the backing.  I don't know if that experience is any different with other styles of tape, as I've only used the standard black-on-white tape.An added bonus was that this device and the tape cartridges are significantly cheaper from Amazon than at the local office supply chain stores, especially with free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime",0

5693,"Good quality for the money. This is a great dvd player if you want to play divx movies or mpeg files burned from your computer onto a cd-r, dvd-r, dvd+r etc. It plays just about every media format on any kind of blank cd or dvd. It also plays the the standard store bought dvds just fine. I needed it because all the dvds I made at home would receive a disc error when trying to watch them on my old Toshiba. It connected to and played fine on my 42"" flat screen LCD HDTV. Photos burned onto a cd also play in a slide show without having to connect your camera - very cool. The only thing about this player I would change would be the remote control. It looks cool but is kinda clunky and has to be pointed at precisely the right spot on the player or you'll end up pushing the button numerous times with no effect. Otherwise I'm more than satisfied and will continue to use it for a long time",0
5694,"Almost perfect. This is the second Wacom tablet I own and the third tablet in general. The other wacom is the 9 x 12. Which, at the time, I thought was the greatest. And the Hyperpen (my first tablet for a starving artist)... well, don't. Don't buy it. Stay away. Horrid thing. Save up and get a small wacom.With the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right. The size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors. And, with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area.The touch stripes are useful but really not necessary. Only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability.The 6 x 11 is just about perfect",0

5704,"Things to consider if you're getting a 2GB card. I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.",0

Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway??  This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares?

The zoom function most plasmas and LCD TVs have is 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas Macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio, so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you're trying to display, or have massive letter-boxing. After three months, I still haven't had any glitches that were this adapter's fault.If you have HDMI or DVI on your TV or projector, don't bother with this.

5714,"Workable for what I need. I got the Nike+ Armband and the Nike+ sensor chip (see: Nike+ Ipod Sport Kit) this past Christmas and have run with it about 15 times so far. Both work for what I need them for, so for me it works out great. I generally run 5 - 8 miles a shot, and only pause a workout when waiting to cross roads. The Armband fits my arms (13 - 14 inch) nicely (Other reviews mention it being too small, I think they're referring to the other Nike Armband, a totally different product). The Ipod fits in the pouch snugly and has a bumped out area at the bottom to accommodate the Nike+ Sensor.The issue with it completely covering the ipod screen is only a slight annoyance for me. Running the pace I run, I would not really be planning on trying to read the screen or try to change play lists. When using it in conjunction with the Nike+ Sensor, the only controls I need on the Nano are to press the center button, turn up or down the volume, hit previous or next or pause. With this armband, I have no problems working any of those controls.  The other things I like about the Armband are the fact that because it is covered and somewhat water proof, I can run in the rain and still use my Nano, also it's made of moisture-wicking material and is completely washable.",0

5716,"Great little item for your flash. If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more.This device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight. No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time. Looks aside, what does it do?It diffuses your flash's light so you get a softer and more spread-out look to your flash. No more pictures looking like you're shining a spotlight on people. This has a more ""natural soft light"" look to it. I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room.The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output. You may have to dial up your exposure (meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage). The tradeoff is irritating sometimes, but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos.",0
5717,Works like a charm. I've seen these online and they are expensive.  This one works well and maintains privacy.  It fits right over your screen and 3M provides these little tabs to make it stick.  I bought it for my office where people walk behind me all the time time and it works great.  I feel like I can check my email or shop on amazon during downtime through out the workday.  This also would be excellent for laptops on airplanes and such.,0

I would highly recommend this product",0
5719,"VN2100 Review. I bought this to replace a much bulkier cassette recorder to record mapping and other info while hiking the vast Hawaii Volcanoes Nat'l Park.  It has exceeded my expectations for clarity, capacity and for not turning on/off accidentally.The volume is great at HQ mode, picking up footsteps in desert areas, with no static as on the cassette recorder. I use ""Hold"" between messages and have recorded 40 over a 12 mile/5 hour hike with no glitches.  In heavy weather, I use it in a ziplok bag, with no apparent loss in quality.I forgot to shut off and put it in a jacket pocket where it kept doing it's job, including some expletives when I deleted a waypoint on my GPS.Only nit-pick is having to re-set time/date when changing batteries.  Not important for my use.  (And I changed needlessly because I mis-read the battery life indicator).  I don't yet know battery life, and may switch to re-chargeables so as to re-charge along with the GPS..just a convenience thingie",0
5720,"Very happy with Sony Bravia. Did a lot of research both on-line and in local stores, looked at Sharp Aquos, Philips and Samsung (all 37"", due to space constraints). Sony Bravia comes in 32"" and 40"", went with smaller, 32"" Bravia because of clarity and color - would rather have smaller Sony quality product than larger of other brands.  Great resolution.

5726,"Superior Sound. I have always considered myself a bit of an audiophile.  I appreciate and enjoy quality sound reproduction in both my music and in my movies.  The Bose Companion 5 sound system delivers sound quality well beyond my high expectations for sound.  The price tag is pretty steep, but I decided to go for the surround sound capabilities offered in the Companion 5 system to augment my 30"" Apple Cinema Display for an immersive movie-going experience on my Mac.  If connected and set up as per the instructions, this sound system delivers the performance as advertised.Connection is by a simple USB plug.  After that, a quick trip to System Preferences in OS X requires a few set up changes in the sound panel and that is all there is to it.  The first time I played music from iTunes I opened my equalizer and adjusted the settings to my preferences as well as the bass settings knob on the acoustimass sub woofer.  I have owned several sets of speakers including Klipsch and I can easily attest that the Bose Companion 5 is superior to all of them.  The first movie I tried out was ""Saving Private Ryan"".  From the DVD options menu I selected Dolby 5.1 audio and then I cranked up the volume and watched the Normandy invasion scene.  It was simply incredible.  Several times I was turning and looking behind me because I thought my dog was knocking something over in the room; only to realize that it was the sound of bullets ricocheting behind me.  Awesome.Of all the Bose products I have owned, I have found them all to deliver superior sound as advertised.  If you can get past the sticker shock on these speakers, and make sure that you've adjusted the sound settings on your computer as well as the equalizer settings in your computer's music player and the bass settings knob on the back of the acoustimass sub woofer, I can pretty much guarantee you're going to be in for a very impressive audio experience whether it is music or movies",0
5727,"Great Product. Great reception, fantastic sound. The infrared capability means no hiss or other radio interference. This headset keeps peace at home.

Be ready to realize how bad Standard Def looks! Once you've seen things in HD, you won't be able to look at your grainy SD signals the same again.

5740,"A must have for Vision M owners. If you're buying a Zan Vision: M, you need this set. The process of charging through the USB cable that comes with the player is ridiculously long and annoying. Both of the chargers work beautifully. I've had absolutely no problems. The only complaint I have is that the cords on these chargers are shorter than I would like. The wall charger cord is 2 or 3 feet long which means it can't go far while it's plugged in. It is hardly long enough to put the player on my desk while it's plugged in. The car charger cord is a foot long, maybe less. It's coiled so that, theoretically, you could stretch it if you needed it to be longer, but in my experience trying to stretch it just pops it out of the lighter socket.

5742,"Mounted my 40"" Sony - No Problem. If you're considering mounting your TV, and don't want to break the bank,  I can recommend this one.  I mounted our Sony KDL-40S20L1 with no problem.  All the hardware is provided for most every brand of TV.I did sweat just a bit when hanging the TV on the bracket.  There seemed to be no more than a couple inches of adjustment left/right.  Luckily, since the bracket was near perfectly centered, the TV did not need to slide much to correct for being ""near"" perfect  :-)   Also, I used two mounting holes in the middle since the wall plate did not spread the 16"" on either side to fasten it to another stud.  Using the one stud/two fasteners seems to be plenty strong for the job.What I did not like about the mount is time it took to turn the screws to secure the braces to the wall bracket.  They are located on the bottom of the braces and ensure the TV does not come off the bracket.  The supplied wrench is ""L"" shaped and the short leg is way too long to turn 360 degrees. (The good news is that your TV is only and inch or so off the wall) I spent more time turning those two screws than the entire time it took to mount the bracket or the braces.  I plan to use my Dremel to trim the leg of the ""L"", or cut it off completely.  I might then be able to use an electric screwdriver with that to speed up that process.Lastly, you'll need a buddy when you mount the TV.  It definitely takes two to make sure the thing gets hung safely.  Good Luck to you",0

5751,"Good protection, smaller than most. I have had this case for about a year and a half now and it has done it's job well. I have dropped it several times and my tungsten still works fine. I usually keep it in my back pocket and I tend to sit on it, and still no problems (except that the case gets a little bent out of shape.) I've just about worn this one out and am going to replace it with the same thing. However, it looks like the  Innopocket is the exact same thing for $10 less. My biggest complaint is that it only opens to 180 degrees. But considering the alternatives, it seems to be the best thing out there for a small hard case",0
5752,it is excellent. I have had another pioneer for a long time. That was great. I was leaning towards SONY or Yamaha model. But I got a good deal on it. So i bought this. I think It is just great,0
5753,Lexar PD-128-231 128 MB JumpDrive Portable USB Flash Drive. This is a fantastic product.  I use it to store work on and my boss and I swap back and forth using each other's jump drives.  Great for making your business portable,0
5754,"Great Garmin Portable Friction Mount. I was very skeptical if this friction mount would work because I read reviews saying that it flies off the dash.I have an X-5 and the dash is curved, but the friction mount ACTUALLY works.  It stays in place even though I have stopped suddenly.In fact, I think I will get another one for my other car.",0
5755,Kingston SD/2GBKR 2 GB SD Memory Card. This product is good. I haven't seen any issues with this so far...,0
5756,"It is not bad for this price. It is nothing fancy and not the greatest quality, but it does the job.  I think it is worth it for the price.",0
5757,WOW! great item. I bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape. Recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by Drying. My wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work. Surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem.,0
5758,"A Solution That Works. I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.)The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable.The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.",0
5759,"Use the right size ear bud attachment, and BAM... Amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones. The different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear.when I first got them I put the smallest buds on first and thought I had just bought the worst headphones. So I tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold.And just let you know I ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just don't fit righ",0
5760,Last one 9 years no problems. Bought the same model again. The last one lasted 9 years on the same battery with no problems. Used for for everyday use and SCUBA diving no problems. Current one still works but needs new battery so i figured I would just get a new one,0
5761,Very Satisfied. Product was just what I was looking for and at the right price.  Could not have been happier with my purchase.  I will look for this vendor again in the future,0
5762,"Great sounding speakers!. I was Impressed with the sound that these speakers produced in my small living room. At 100/120 RMS, these will run circles around any BOSE! Keep in mind that this is a Mid to Hi-range  Speaker, so for the Low range, you will need a Sub. (If you use these for your front speakers.)In addition, the NS-555 and -777 is essentually the same as the -333(given, larger enclosure) with 2 low-range speakers (with seperate +/- Posts).For cinema it may be best to buy 2 or 3 pair for a 6/7 channel reciever and a Sub woofer, than to spend money on the (2)555 or (2)777.",0
5763,Dont pay too much for that cable. I picked up this hdmi cable after price shopping and review reading. I have bought other cables from cables to go and received good bang for my buck. This cable was no exception.,0
5764,Just the best. everything looks great with this monster...power power...i cant wait to overclok it a bit to squeeze it.,0
5765,"Excellent speaker cables. I am a person who mainly listens to the overall music rather than spending time to pickout each and every instrument while listeing to a music album. However I should admit that after listeing to my music system using the monster cable, overall the  listening has become more enjoyable. In fact while listening to the song ""HotelCalifornia"" I almost felt that some unwanted sounds also have started coming through my speakers, as over year of listening, I was tuned to certain sounds and when the new cable started reproducing sounds which was previously not heard, it was a total surprise. There was a noticable improvement over my previous cable in terms of bass (earlier was Monster THX hometheater cable, biwired by me using monster banana plugs) and the postioning of vocals and lead instruments was more clear which I earlier thought was more of the imagination of the reviewer.I am very happy about this buy and would recomment the same to anybody who have a good mid-end amp/speakers",0
5766,"Careful with your slot!. This is a PCMCIA card. New laptops (e.g. Dell Inspiron E1705) have ExpressCard slots. This is a new standard but it is not compatible with PCMCIA slot. Before going for this card make sure you have a PCMCIA slot in your notebook, or else the card won't fit. There is no ExpressCard soundcard yet",0
5767,"Great Mouse- Perfect for Desktop PC or Laptop Use. I originally bought this mouse for my work laptop, thinking it was smaller than it actually is.  It's smaller than the mouse that was already provided, but bigger than a laptop mouse.  That's my mistake for not reading the specs.  Not having the red laser saves on power, and the range has been good so far.  I love the left/right scrolling function, perfect for big Excel sheets.  The back and forward buttons are nice too, although I don't use them as much.  The provided software allows you to customize buttons for specific software, and you can change the default functions as well.  Definitely a great buy",0
5768,"great buy. i did some shopping around on consumer reports and such before i invested in a flat screen. this really is a great tv. the picture is beautiful, the sound matches. its awesome",0
5769,Monster Quality. Run my PC to my Carver pre-amp. Does a great job without losing any sound along the way,0
5770,Works flawlessy. I've had it for a month.  It does what it should.  No problems easy to set up.  What I like is the tiny size compare to the previous generation of switches,0
5771,"Great Picture, Great Combo TV, Can't Channel Surf!. I love the picture this TV gives. Great deal for the money you pay. Unfortunately when you want to channel surf, it takes forever to change channels. I tried using the automatic channel programming mode, but it did not make channel surfing any faster. Overall I really like this TV for the fact that we mounted it on the wall and the dvd player is already connected. If you want a spacesaver at a good price this TV is definately worth it",0
5772,"Absolutely awesome!. We have owned this item for over a year and are still LOVING it!  The sounds is great and it is so easy to use.  We use it everyday for both radio and CD listening on average for 30-45 minutes and the batteries last surprisingly long.  Highly recommend it.  I know there are some less expensive units available, but this is worth every penny",0
5773,Nothin' but love for the JBL ON STAGE II!. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my JBL ON STAGE II!!!  Size/shape is great!  Sound is outstanding!  What more do you want?!  :)  BUY IT!,0
5774,Western Digital 320GB Hard Drive. A great drive at a great price.  Easy to install,0
5775,"It's great having three. These Motorola telephones have good looks, sound quality and range.  It's great having three phones placed around the house with only one main base. My only complaint is that they are a bit on the small side and that takes a little getting use to.  As always Amazon's price was the best",0
5776,"Outstanding Sound Quality--It's like getting new ears. After months and years of frustration with balky, expensive, poorly sounding sound cards from that 'creative' company, I finally gave up and did my homework.  M-Audio has been in the business for a long time, but most of there gear is specialty items.  At just the right time came just the right product.  This is an excellent sound card--the specs you can read, but hearing is believing.The difference is just incredible.  You don't know what you're missing in your music until you try out this sound card.  Absolutely no distortion, dead quiet background noise, and silky smooth, flat wide response.  Listening to a lot of jazz, blues, classical and acoustic music demands the very best of a sound system.  With the Revolution card, I can hear musical detail that just wasn't there before.  I don't need to turn up the volume (although it's a lot of fun) to hear the rhythm section and background instruments.  The splash of cymbals, the clank of a cow bell, or the strings of an acoustic bass are right there in front of you.  You'll want the best quality speakers or headphones to get the most out of this card.Great user interface / control panel.  The control panel is cleanly designed and easy to understand.  You can see the input signal strength independently of setting the output volume and  avoid overdriving the DACs.  There are a bunch of surround sound synthesis options which work very well--even with headphones.I went for the 7.1, but the 5.1 would be fine for most applications and at a (street) price 1/3 of the high-end SB cards.Well done M-Audio.  It's about time someone showed SB how to do it right",0
5777,"Outstanding Receiver. I purchased this item on March 15 from Amazon. We've been using it for almost a month now. My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40"" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the surround speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity  subwoofer with a HSU STF-2 sub.Originally my first choice was a Pioneer VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. I'm planning to install my extra pair RC60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet.Overall we're very pleased with our purchased Thanks AMAZON!",0
5778,as expected. the speakers are good quality and the Amazon service is great as usual. sony has always been tops for me.,0
5779,perfect for video ipod. no need to spend 60 dollars or more on the flashy monster/apple cable just hook this fella up and away you g,0
5780,"Good Guitar. Period. I receieved my guitar in the mail early and upon opening the package, I got a better guitar than I expected, especially for the price.I paid 90 bucks for this guitar, and I feel that it didn't even cost half of what it should have. I would have paid twice that amount just for the guitar by itself.I strongly recommend this guitar to anyone starting out, and as a gift for someone else",0
5781,"Works, but is bulkier than the Apple charger. This will charge your Ipod without any problem. However as a travel charger it is much larger than the Apple charger, and the plug does not fold in. However it is less money, which is the main reason that I bought it. I mainly use it to charge my Ipod in the house when my laptop is not around, but for travel purposes I take the smaller  Apple charger",0
5782,It's a good stuff!!. This Portable Friction Mount can stand on my dash and never fall down!Strongly recommend!,0
5783,"Fantastic!. I love this thing! I've been transferring files to it all day, and its just barely warm. Running a Maxtor hard drive in it and it fit great. Very small hassle, very quick to install & looks pretty sweet. 2 thumbs up",0
5784,"Great reception for the outdoors!. The headphone antenna certainly works much better than the internal antenna of my Tao XM2Go, though if you're thinking you can enjoy listening to portable xm around the house. You're wrong. You get the same great reception as you would from your xm car kit antenna when outdoors, but you're not gonna get any better reception indoors. They're fit very snug, maybe too snug for some people liking but the sound on them is excellent",0
5785,You better have the power for this unit to work right. I tryed to use this on an older p4 1500 megahz and had a few glitiches during the recording (loss of frames).Then I broke out the wifes new laptop and had no problem at all.The S video from my old High 8 Video Cam came out perfect.  Sound was perfect too.The point is you MUST have the power.  I do not care what the manufacture put on the box.I would have given it 5 stars if the recomended computer requirements matched what I had to use to get the results.,0
5786,"Very good. Stand-alone CD players (not combimed with DVD players) are rare nowadays, and this is one of the better ones, especially since it plays CD-Rs. A defect, unfortunately quite typical of electronic appliances these days, is the completely unnecessary standby function that cannot be turned off",0
5787,"Easy to install and easy to use. Installs easily right out of the package, just plug it in your usb adapter and you're off and running.  Feels very smooth on the hand.  Smooth and comfortable",0
5788,Nice Price for the Mic. If you are starting off and want a descent mic without breaking the bank this mic gets the job done. Just make sure you power it off after each use or you'll burn through batteries very quickly.,0
5789,"4-4-4-12 timing .. running great. Everything you expect good ram to be. Its fast, its fairly well priced,and its of upstanding quality.Vary good stuff if you plan to be using it for animation or video game stuff.Right now, its on a ASUS P5W DH DELUXE board, with 10000 RPM drive,3.2GH Intel D940, 8800GTX video card.Over all the system looks fairly great.",0
5790,"$249 - It's a Great Buy!. Not sure what some of the purchasers expected, but this is a fantastic navigation system for $249. Touch screen is great. We programmed all of our frequent trip addresses into the GPS and can get to them from anywhere. Excellent coverage from downtown Detroit to Up North Michigan.. No complaints... Again, for $249  a GREAT DEAL",0

5793,"Easy as shit. Great router! It was a snap to setup, install, and run! Highly recommend it. Linksys tech-support is great. A monkey can install this thing. Note: I didn't mention a Caveman. Look what happened to Geico when they did",0
5794,"iM716 ..........current bargain amongst iem's. This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in ""hi-fi"" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion.The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening.",0
5795,"Stylish and useful. i like this better than the i-p's and it works great,many features and long battery life, gets recharged from the usb connection on your computer.",0
5796,"It is the best on the Market!!. I GOT THIS CABLE LAST WEEK TO CONNECT MY STEREO SPEAKES TO MY T.V., AND  NOW WHEN I  WATCH MOVIES THE SOUND IS INCREDIBLE, ALTHOUGH IT IS ONLY A 19  INCH T.V.  (LOL) I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU CHOOSE THIS CABLE!!!!!",0
5797,"Great Stand. I bought the stand for my 50 inch plasma on Jan 2 2007.  The stand is made of high quality material.  It looks sleek and neat.  Had no problems setting it up.  The black base unti does collect a lot of dust as does anything that color.  Running the wires through the pole in the back is time consuming and frustrating, but hey that's the price we pay to hide all the cables and making it look neat.  Overall, very satasfied with the product",0
5798,"Sound Great. These speakers are both stylish and sound great, a nice compliment to my first Mac computer",0
5799,"GOOD UNIT, HOWEVER NO RESUME ON CD, REAR EARPHONES!. Just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers, I was searching for CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote.ADVANTAGES ARE:1) The ONLY smaller desktop unit that I found with CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote.2) Has sleep timer 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 and 120 minutes. This is handy for CD's, MP3's and the radio.3) Fairly good sound for the money.4) Easy to use remote. (I leave mine next to the unit).DISADVANTAGES ARE:1) Earphone plug in the back of the unit. When I want to plug in my earphone, it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design!2) My biggest disappointment--no resume on CD or MP3! I listen to alot of audio books and I find this a real inconveince! I have to go to the track that I think I left off or write it down! (My Panasonic MP3 CD small portable has this, why did they forget this in this one?).3) Terrible reception on AM--STATIC!4) Sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use.I bought this because it is the only AM/FM/CD/MP3/CASSETTE unit with a timer and remote that I could find! Since the AM radio is so terrible, I ended up buying the Sony ICF-M410V so I can listen to my AM talk shows. This one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes, a clock and easy to use.Overall, I still give it a 4 because of it's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes. **And, I wish I would have bought it on Amazon, not at Radio Shack (they were about $25 more). Live and learn! If you are looking for a all in one with CD, MP3, CASSETTE, REMOTE AND AM-FM RADIO, this is about the only one that you will find and I looked for 3 months!UPDATE: September 18, 2006: After owning this one month, I like it better and better! I love the SLEEP feature that you can use up to 120 minutes (2 hours) either on the radio or the CD! This AUTOMATICALLY shuts the unit off. It is a great feature if you are listening to a CD that contains 40 hours of MP3's on it and you don't want it to play all night",0
5800,Targus PA238U. The stand is a great height.  It is now much easier to use my laptop - no neck strain and shoulder strain from having to sit and type in an uncomfortable position.  The criticism I have is that it is difficult to get to the USB ports in the back of my laptop.  I would also like the top of the stand to be a little more vented for cooling the laptop,0
5801,"Better then all the fancy mousepads - buy this. This is a great product at a great price. I bought four twenty dollar  mouse pads before this, all the others really serve no purpse, the gel  packs block my way the harder surfaces dont grab that well and it is  worthless and a horrible waste of money. This mouse pad is the one im  sticking with it grabs well looks good and its under 5 bucks!! This is a  must for anyone. When it all comes down to it, all the fancy stuff serves  no purpose and wastes alot of money. Buy this product",0
5802,"Handy Gadget to Prevent Skipping. When my CDs started skipping I thought they has seen the last days of spinning, however this Disc Cleaner has solved all problems. You simply put the CD into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed.Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick.The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my CDs. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go.This unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. I think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints, you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often.Handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces.~TheRebeccaReview.com",0

5807,"KB Gear Jam Tablet- it's worth it. I bought this recently not knowing much about what was out on the market in terms of tablets, and I have some advice if you're going to buy this product.Pros: It's a shame Wacom doesn't make tablets that are 5x7 since I have found out that this is the perfect size- it's not so small that you have no room to draw properly, and it's not big enough that you have to hurt your arm  with long movements after a tiring day at work. The price- I bought this for 20 C dollars at the local Radioshack, but you can get one for much cheaper online compared to a Wacom Graphire which is 4x5 and upwards of around 50 US dollars. It's compatible with almost every graphics software and works remarkably well. Unless you're a professional graphics designer, you won't need any of the costly Wacom tablets if you've got this.Cons: When I first unpackaged it, I was tearing my hair out for two days trying to figure out how to make this work in Windows XP. For all of you out there with a similar problem, download this driver for the newer versions of Windows and relax:http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/KBGearTablet.zipThe pen sensitivity will need to be set to your desired pressure-sensitivity first, so don't try it out before going to Control Panel and changing the settings. I find that the best setting to use for the barrel button option is Left double-click. :) Hope that helped a bit",0
5808,"Works As Advertised With the Exception of the Speeds. This helps my network tremeendously in terms of speed.  In other words,if you are supposed to get up to 8mbps, you will get it from your ISP.  I found that hard to do on my wireless network for some reason.  It doesn't necessarily do HD content, all that well though, but I think you have to get the more expensive one to do that. But it did allow me to hard wire my media center extenders to my network as well as my media center PC.  I have a much more secure connection now.   I do get speeds of about 40mbps most of the time, and I am reasonably satisfied with that since that is a pretty big jump in performance.",0
5809,"Great tool to have around the house. I really like this label maker.  I've been using it to label ski equipment and various household items.  I bought a roll of iron-on fabric tape so I can label my son's clothes for summer camp.It hooks into a PC easily with a USB cable in just a minute.  It comes with a PC application that's akin to a word-processor.  You can compose all your labels on your PC and then just select print.  Any font can be used and you can included graphics.The only downside is the cartridges of label tape are not inexpensive.  If you would like a few colors, you will have to invest in several cartridges that cost $12-20 each.  Admittedly each cartridge will print many many labels so it's only if you want a variety of colors that you would have to spend a lot on cartridges.",0

First of all, these are good speakers, nice design but it has one flaw.batteries...A. it eats them up ...FASTB. if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with, it wont go as loud, and if it thinks your playing it to loud, it will start..skipping.. or something of the sort.But, it has good sound quality, and honeslty when your on the go, when do you really need it blasting?Also they are just..barley large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly, but it doesnt weigh much at all.And i really like how if i ever say..lost my Ipod somehow, it has a Cd player (walkman) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod.( the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters )",0

I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing.  I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it.  The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable",0

I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what ""hold"" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use",0
5814,"A great buy to keep my shredder in tip-top shape!. I bought this together with my Fellowes shredder, and it has kept my shredder working in perfect condition. No complaints so far",0
5815,"LOVE IT. Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds",0
5816,"This does what it's supposed to do. This little microphone works well for me. I've owned it since August and now it's November 3. I use it with my Olympus WS-100 to take notes which I then save to my computer and import it into Dragon Naturally Speaking version 9 Preferred which then produces a Microsoft Word document. I speak into the microphone from about 2 inches away and am really careful with my diction and pronunciation because there is just a little bit of distortion if you over drive it. But with a little work in practice it does what it's supposed to do. Oh, one side note if you do import this into Dragon be aware you will have to make corrections. Sometimes a lot of them but that's based on how you speak. Or maybe that's based on how I speak that's been my experience anyway. But that's not the fault of the microphone",0
5817,"Does the job as promised. This is exactly what I was looking for: not too expensive, not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit, and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press ""Scroll Lock"" twice to go from one computer to the other.Cables are pretty long, which is good: longer that I need at the moment, but I may appreciate the extra length in the future.",0
5818,"Good product. The positives are: excellent sound quality and perfect reception when near transmitter.The negatives are: the headphones quickly become uncomfortable. I prefer earbuds after using these. The reception is good when nearby or in line of sight of the transmitter. You're not going to get the advertised range if the signal is going through walls.Also, I did the boiling the headphones band described in this forum to avoid cracking. It seems to have worked. No problems there, other than my daughter and her friends thought I was crazy",0
5819,"Up and running in 5 minutes. I just had to unpack it and plug in the cables, then set it for a cable connection and that is it. Beautiful picture",0
5820,"Well whuduhya expect for 25 bucks?. On first glance uppon opening this package, I was alarmed by how small they really were.  Unlike lots of headphones, these seat on the ear rather than around.  They do have three speakers per side. However, due to how close the drivers are to one another being that they're so small, the 3D sound feild leaves more to be desired as far as gaming is concerned.  Good sound quality at low volume, and great frequency response.  Bass, as you can expect, suffers at elevated volume but is good otherwise.  Having volume control on your keyboard is a blessing with these.  They are durable, have a hideously long chord, and are too easy to instal.  The part that rests on the top of your head however, is just semi-stiff plastic.  I'll probably figure out some way to pad them better, but they can be worn for long durations out of the box.Bottom line, yes they're 3D.  Yes they're cheap.  They're definitly worth the money, but if your're willing to spend an extra few bucks, I'd recomend the Z-mans Theater6's, being that their front and rear speakers are way further appart.  From what I hear about those, they ""require"" an amp to work to their full potential",0
5821,Great Carry Case!. This is a great carry case for the Sony TX series.  I just wish it wasn't that expensive...but this is a must if have you this laptop...for protection purposes that is,0
5822,Easy. Within about 12 seconds of opening the box I was listening to my IPOD on my home stereo.  Wires are well made.There may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever,0
5823,"excellent little player. The more I use this player, the more I like it.  I see at least a couple of reviews of unhappy users who have either unrealistic expectations or haven't yet learned it's features.  True, it's not the most intuitive player for advanced features, but basic features are easily picked up and if you play around with it, you can figure it out the more advanced features quite easily.  This coming from a guy who thought he was getting left behind in technology.To the person who had difficulty changing songs while running. Easily addressed in two ways.  1- Run with it in your hand, it's small and fits well in a loose griped hand. or 2- learn to set up play lists.  You really should be concentrating on looking where you are going and what's around you (especially when your hearing is somewhat impaired), not flipping through songs.I find it appropriate for it's intended use (excercise, activity), maybe not for the car or trying to DJ with it.Software is not that bad, but defenitely not the best.  It's managable, I've certainly seen worse.Maybe because I want to, but I think I can hear a slight difference between the SONY ATRAC and MP3 formats.  The Sony does sound better.Yeah, needing a computer to charge it can blow, but the battery life is very good and how often are you away from a computer.  I'll find out how good the battery life really is soon on a trip to South America.Also there are not a lot of accessories.  No car charger/transmitter for this model (that I've seen), but again, you have to consider this model's intended purpose and it definitely shines in this area.  Would you rather take a full size IPOD or this thing running/biking",0

5828,"Very good, high-powered stereo receiver. The fad today is for multi-channel audio/video receivers. But most people stiill listen to music with just two speakers and, consequently, only need a good stereo receiver. In fact, a sound stereo system featuring a good stereo receiver, such as this Onkyo, and an excellent pair of speakers will sound better than a typical multi-channel system which usually features several mediocre speakers. Unless you can afford a good multi-channel receiver and several good speakers you will get better sound by sticking with good stereo equipment. The Onkyo TX-8522 is a very good stereo receiver with a wide range of inputs and controls, including a remote control. With 100 watts per channel power it is capable of driving virtually any speakers to deafening levels (which is NOT good for your ears) even if you are inclined to apply significant bass boost. Although the TX-8522 is very reasonably priced, if you would prefer a less expensive receiver, consider the 50 watts per channel Onkyo TX-8211",0
5829,"Outstanding bargain. I am using these speakers with a very low watt Sonic Impact T-Amp.  The speakers respond wonderfully.  With the T-Amp they fill a medium sized room with really nice sound--very clean, very nice reponse across the frequency range.  I have not used them for really loud rock music, so I can't comment on that aspect, but they exceeded my expectations by a lot",0
5830,"Great phone... We purchased this because it expands up to 8 handsets, which is fantastic. Some people have had sound issues. We don't. It's very clear, no static of any kind. It's great that it's got the volume button on the side of the handset. The speaker is also clear, no static and loud enough (volume is adjustable).We're not into ringtones, but I wish it had a simple, regular ringtone. I hate the musical ones.We do like that you can set up a different ring tone for different people. That way you know who's calling without looking at the phone. You can also record your own sound.We like that you can check your messages from the handset or remotely.The base itself takes 50 entries into the directory; however, the handsets take 100 (that's strange). It keeps up to 10 redial numbers.The bad thing about the phone is that you cannot enter the directory into one handset and then send it to the others. If you have a lot of entries, like we do, this is a real pain.Another drawback is when you get a call, and you answer it, the rest of the handsets don't recognize that you answered that call. They will still show it as a missed call. This is annoying.Other than the little quirks (which we can live with), we love it. It's a sturdy phone, color screen, you can change the screensavers, adjust the screen contrast and it's got a mute button, which is great.",0
5831,"Great (as long as you don't live in California!). The funny thing about the MIC... there's a warning in the box that says it contains lead which is *believed to* cause cancer in the State of California (I'm not making this up!)    I have no idea what makes lead particularly more toxic in California than anywhere else, but my advice to anyone who buys it... do not EAT the microphone.As for the package... I'm new to podcasting.  (Actually I got it as much for the audio interface and to be able to do some voice overs for a project I'm working on as for Podcasting.)   I wound up getting the ""kit"" because... it would have actually been more expensive to get the mic then the audio interface. (You can't just plug most mic's directly into the computer... )    So by the time you get the Mic and the Interface, you're actually spending more, even without the software.I have had some minor configuration problems - - but all in all, everything seems pretty simple, and the instructions get to the point...  hence its useful, hence the * * * * * - - as to the opinions of more experienced users... let's see what they have to say whether its a good deal of not",0
5832,Nice Ipod charger. I had no problems with this Ipod charger.  It charges rapidly and quickly and it doesn't over charge.  I carry it will me everywhere,0
5833,"Works well-- what's not to like?. I purchased this unit after reading reviews of a close cousin to this recorder, its predecessor, which is apparently very picky about the specific -r, -rw or dvd ram disk you purchase for recording media.  I've had no issues in this regard.  I followed the purchase recommendations in the manual for blank media, and the recorder has worked well for me.  Even when recording to 1-16 X DVD -R's, something I thought might cause a hick-up, I found no problem.I have this unit hooked up to a Panasonic Plasma TV.  I use it as the tuner for my non-high-def cable signal.  I have an alternate input for a television antenna.  This whole system plugs into a Bose surround sound home theater system. Since the DVD recordings cannot be in high def anyhow, using the Toshiba DVD recorder for a cable box works out well.   Were it not for this DVD player, I'd have to reprogram the Panasonic HD tuner for cable stations when I wanted to switch from the high def antenna input to standard cable. (I don't want to pay for high def cable service, otherwise this would be an option as well.)One issue I have run into, that was mystyifying at the time, is that if I have a disk ready to record in the dvd player, and I turn to the History channel here in Detroit, the copy protect mechanism in the DVD recorder messes up the reception.  If I simply open the disk carrier, so that recording is impossible, the signal clears immediately.  This is the only channel that I have this problem on.  I believe there is some sort of digital protection on this particular cable channel that the Toshiba responds to by distorting the signal so it cannot be recorded.I use this recorder to record many shows I like.  Unfortunately, I cannot record the history channel shows, for reasons discussed above.Other than this glitch, I really like this recorder.  The image it produces for my 1080i plasma when playing DVDs is outstanding-- as good and maybe better than a much more expensive unit from Bose.  The HDMI and optical output is nice to have, and the price is outstanding",0
5834,"Nice Cable - Works Great. After upgrading my computer's video to one of the high end card and upgrading my Monitor to a nice flat LCD (Norcent), I realized Standard VGA connection simply not doing the job.   I am running Windows Vista Ultimate and display was getting analog connection (with a lot of visible lines).   I went to some of the local stores and realized they are nothing but trying to rip people off.   I got this from Amazon and right away my connection changed from Analog to Digital and awesome display.   I simply love it.  I probably would have loved it even more if the connectors were gold plated.   But the way it is, does its job (very well, I should add)",0

5836,"Awesome!. Being a metalhead myself, I very much thought it might of overpowered the music (the phones that is.) I read very many reviews on these headphones, and thought it was right to buy these. They were compared to Shure, and Bose. but being a metal head, If you love metal, and/or rock, these headphones OWN especially the double bass and the heavy guitar riffs. If you love rap, I acquired some to see what these headphones could deliver, and it was amazing.5/5",0
5837,"great radio. I initially bought a black one and loved it soo much that I went and bought a white one. I have it hooked up by aux port to a mac mini and small wall mounted 19"" lcd. Looks great and can listen to internet radio at night plus surf the web with a classy sound interface. The white colour and fit (I have it stacked on top)  also matched the mac mini perfectly so don't be afraid. All in all it's a great radio with good sound for a small bed room",0
5838,"good, but a little pricey. The tape was good but it was around 10 dollars and some places sold it for 8",0
5839,Pleased. I like the solid feeling and the positive action of the stick. The twist is a little on the stiff side but not unmanagable. The twelve buttons are nice to have,0
5840,"Works Great on Vista. I bought this to watch and record tv on my laptop.  I had a hard time finding the correct download for Vista OS but their TS was very helpful and once I got it installed it worked great!  The HDTV channels look fantastic!  The remote works fine, and it has been easy to use.  Like one of the other reviews, I have 2 gb dual core processor so that may help.  I have not tried to burn a DVD with it, but that wasn't my primary reason to purchase.  The included antena works great.  Before you buy, you can go to the Pinnacle website, and do a search on your zipcode to see what channels have good strength in your area.  That may help in your decision. Enjoy",0
5841,Does what it says. IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does.,0
5842,"Volume is too high. I really enjoy this product.  I bought it because of the great reviews.  The worst thing I can say about this is the volume you set the Ipod to wake up to.  10 is the lowest you can go and when your in a dead sleep it can be very startling.  I am also having trouble hooking up the clock to my TV so I can watch my ipod video.  I think I might just need to troubleshoot it so I can't say for sure that that is a problem.  Other than those two things, I love my Iluv",0
5843,GREAT plug-n-play product. This KVM works exactly as described.  I was a little concerned when I read the online manual because it says that the Mouse and KB USB ports are component specific.  I'm using a wireless mouse/KB combo from Logitech - it works flawlessly.  This KVM also supports the higher screen resolutions that a competing (top brand) product doesn't.  I also like that this KVM switches the audio (most don't) - therefore I can enjoy my high end speakers with both computers.  Overall it is technically excellent and available at a very competitive price,0

There is plenty of room for the computer, the cord in the supplied cord pouch, a mouse and still have lots of room left over.  There are numerous pockets for discs, and a special seperate pocket for a jump drive or an MP3 player.

The Nike+iPod system works great and without a hitch, but to join the club, you need a $150 iPod nano, this kit, and unless you have just the right shoes, either some new Nike's or a third party accessory to tie the sensor up to your shoe. This kit is very durable; once, the sensor shot out of my shoe and landed in the snow. I didn't realize it for like 5 minutes. When I came back, I just popped it back in and kept running. The thing's really well built. While the kit works, I would've liked the Nike software on my computer instead of on the internet, and I would've liked better battery performance from my nano while I'm running with the kit.

5853,"Best Radio Value. My bedside radio requirements were: Front firing speaker, AM and FM external antenna inputs, aux input.  This radio pulls in my regular stations without have to rotate the radio or attach my Terk tunable AM loop. The rotating volume knob adjusts in very small increments to more closely resemble an analog control.  Press on the knob to toggle between bass, treble, and volume without have to look at the display or navigate menus.  The bass and treble control generously adjusts from -7 to +7.  Dial that tone in and turn up the volume. This radio sounds excellent!  The bass is ported in the back of the flawless black lacquer case and it will deliver more clear treble than you want. I wasn't purchasing the radio as a clock or alarm but the radio is worth buying even if you still need to use a separate clock (LED's are better in the dark anyway).",0

I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar",0

5858,Good buy. Ive had this fridge for about 3 yrs now- i got this when i was 17 or 18 and it still works great and is worth the money. Its perfect for teenager or college students dorm. Ive had this in the bedroom since then and i have gotten compliments on it and how cool it was and its good to store some drinks and you can have a decent amount of food or other things in there but it is perfect size for the bedroom but inside it is small to medium storage capacity- but for its smallness it is very powerful and keeps drinks and other things ice cold and also comes with a little freezer compartment which is also very powerful- id say it can hold about a case of drinks or case and half and some room for food- its better for storing drinks. But overall good little fridge with lots of power and nice silver design,0

5860,"surprising good. I have a pair of v-moda bass buds - and they are awesome, although a bit expensive... but the skullcandy buds come a close second - and I have gone through DOZENS of buds!  The only complaint my family has (we all experience this) - is that the buds make our ears tickle sometimes.  The volume control on the cord is PERFECT for using at work because I can listen at my ""rather loud"" volume until someone comes in and then I can reduce volume instantly and easily.  Sound quality is awesome!  If it were possible I would give these a 4.5 stars",0
5861,Quite good. Good sound and relative comfortable for in-ear headphones.  The great advantage of these headphones is that they are very well made and you actually have to try to break them thus making them an excellent choice for running with your ipod.

After going through at least 4 CD player/boom boxes for my daughter (including 2 of the Fisher Price ""Tough"" ones, the Mickey Mouse one, and the Barbie Karaoke one), we bought this one.  None of the others lasted even 6 months, and they were all picky about certain CD's.  We've had this one for about 2 years and never had a problem.  It has been used every single day--usually multiple times.  It reads all of my daughter's CDs (which tend to get scratched and dirty), and she has been able to operate it since she got it at 2 years old.  Now my 21-month-old has figured it out as well, and we plan to buy another one for her this year",0
5866,"I gotta say... wow!. I have owned a pair of Etymotic ER6is and a pair of Shure's E2s, which are both very good quality earbuds, but I have to say, this is by far the best pair of in-ear-monitors I have ever owned. You really can hear the difference between earbuds with single drivers and these dual driver monitors. The lows and highs don't interfere with each other, which may may be difficult to understand, but you will when you hear them. No matter how low the bass, the highs are still constant and unaffected... and vice versa. However, in my opinion, the difference in audio quality between these earbuds and pair less in price (like Shure E2Cs, for example) are, what some may consider, subtle. But, for the true audiophile, this difference is just enough to justify spending so much on a pair of buds. I took these through a few brief tests when I got them, playing several mp3s that were rather bass heavy and have been known to produce poor sound on previously owned earbuds... and I smiled. The UEs played the bass clearly and the highs were bright and uninterrupted, the way they were meant to be heard. As for the construction and quality of materials, they could use some work. The cord is a tad bit cheap and I'm curious to see how long it lasts before shorting out, but that brings me to another absolutely genius idea they have created. A user replaceable cord. Everyone knows, cords short out. There is no headphone that will not short out. My guess is, the drivers will last quite some time, but no matter what, the cord will short out. Well, for $20, you can get a brand new cord. The old one simply unplugs from the buds... but don't worry about that just yet, because they have a very generous 2 year warranty. What more could you ask for? In short, I recommend buying these earbuds. They are the best I've ever owned, and if you have very picky ears, they'll appreciate them",0
5867,"Great deal. I was so unsure about buying a tv card, but ireally wanted one, so i was researching them for a few months and finally got the courage to buy this one.

5868,"Sounds good, great value. This JBL 12"" subwoofer is a fine product, and a great value when purchased through Amazon.  The price was about 40% lower compared to what they were asking for it at Best Buy, all I had to do was wait a few days for it to arrive.  Plus there is no additional cost for sales tax, which where I live is nearly 8%.  This pushes my total savings up to 48%, nearly half price!  There was no additional cost for shipping, either.  This was my first Amazon shopping experience, and I'm quite satisfied.  I may continue to shop at Best Buy, but I doubt I will purchase from them anymore when I can get the exact same thing on Amazon for so much less.  Best Buy:  $430(price) + $34(tax) = $464(total).  I paid $240 total for the exact same thing new-in-the-box from Amazon.  Heck, if you really insist on spending that much then get 2 from Amazon instead of 1 from Best Buy and have twice the power to annoy your neighbors!",0
5869,Great quality. I just received this for Christmas and so far I am impressed.  The case feels very sturdy with easy access to all the side buttons and expansion ports when open or closed.

Cute earphones =)They tangle easily but that can be avoided by wrapping them around your iPod.They're cheap enough carry around anywhere but valuable enough to give good sound.I'm 100% satisfied =DP.S. They might be too big for a smaller ear, but that can't really be avoided with any other earphone.P.P.S. Go for it.Buy them. =",0
5874,"A Great Training Device for Bikers. I think the last reviewer said it best. Garmin set out to make a bike computer that blows away the competition. And they succeeded. As long as you understand that this is not your typical GPS device, with detailed maps whose primary function is to let you know where you are and keep you from getting lost, you will not be disappointed. The device gives you all the great features that you would expect from a high end bike computer; And then it gives you a whole bunch more.By using GPS you can keep track of where you went and use that data later to compare with previous rides. You can also map out your rides in detail after they are complete with Google Earth. The included training center software is good, but not great. The Motion Based website is a great addition (Though the EDGE is not compatible with the website yet) and between the two you should be able to analyze your data to your hearts content.It is an excellent training device and is very accurate. It acquires satellites very quickly and seems to keep track even in narrow canyons and pretty dense forests. It can also be used while hiking. It is very customizable and allows you to read as much or as little data as you want and you can set up that data any way you like.I first attempted to gather data like this with a Forerunner 201. That was a mess. That device provided one frustration after the other. Garmin appears to really have looked at the negative reviews that followed their initial Forerunner devices and really created a fantastic device that is truly created with the biker, not a runner, in mind.So any complaints? Just a few minor ones. The bike mount that comes with it is pretty cheesy. It is held on with zip ties. For $250 dollars I would like to see a little more. The bike mount you can purchase (for about $15) for the Forerunner is so much better. I hope they eventually upgrade that. The Flap that covers the USB cable port on the back of the unit is a pain as well. It is very hard to seat it properly. A little bit of patience and perseverance and you do eventually get it right. Other than that the device is great and highly recommended.",0
5875,"Just what we wanted. My brother and I were looking to replace our mother's broken CD player.  We wanted something that looked and sounded good and that was also easy to use.  Finding something with the last attribute, simplicity of use, without giving up the first two attributes was the hard part.  The Tivoli CD player was ideal:  One CD only, play-pause-stop, forward-back, that's it, and that is all that is necessary - and it is very attractive and sounds great.  It was the perfect gift - she loves it",0

Highly recommended!!!",0

5879,"Excellent R G B Cables. The Monster Cable THX V100 CV-8 Component Video Cables are excellent connectors for DVD to Component inputs on HD and RGB (Red, Green, Blue component) capability TV sets. These cables are durable and deliver the best possible signal to your set. Any TV with Component inputs is going to give you a noticeably better picture than with Composite or S-Video inputs but the edge with these cables is their high-density double shielding and heavy gold plated RCA connectors, delivering a cleaner sand purer signal.",0
5880,"Logitech does a superb job with the Harmony 880. I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database.  Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package.  In any event the process was hassle free and I  now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great.  (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.)  My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off.  However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again.  The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base.  Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880.",0
5881,"Comfortable. This earphone is very comfortable. I had to get one because my cat chewed up my original earphone that came with my MP3 player. But I'm glad I bought it because it's way comfortable than the one I was using before. It doesn't hurt your ears even after wearing for a long time, and it stays put well too. The sound quality is okay; it doesn't blow you away or anything, but you don't really notice it's so bad either. Most of all it's cheap. It's a good deal",0
5882,"Not sure if it's worth the money?  Read on. If you're like me, you are probably wondering if these little cables are actually worth the money. I was using cheap thin wired connections before, and my receiver would have LOTS of background noise and buzzing, so I thought I'd go ahead and give these things a shot. Afterall, I listen to MP3's all the time on my computer through my high end receiver. I'll tell you what, these things work great, and are worth the extra money. Now keep in mind, I'm an audiophile who is very picky about sounds. So for the casual listener who doesn't mind occasional background hissing or lack of crystal clear sound transfer from your computer to your receiver, you might be able to find a cheaper connection. But once again, I think the extra $$ is well worth it and I HIGHLY recomend these. Your only concern here is an economical one. As far as the product is concerned, these things are top notch.  Get the 20 feet if you have to go across the a long wall or room to connect your computer to the receiver, otherwise the 10 ft should suffice",0

In fact these ordered replaced the original pair, because my pug Mimi decided to play with them and chewed the buds. She's fine but the buds were ruined! One thing I found out the hard way, is not to wear them on airlines when the plane is landing or taking off. The pressure differences will effect your ears. Great product...",0
5885,"Awesome for running. I bought these in hopes of better head phones while running because my ear buds just wouldn't stick in my big ears, they are nice and snug on your head when you apply them too.

5886,"UFO-Shaped Bounary Mike a hit with me. I have been happy with the ATR97 for years.  It captures voice very well.  It is compact, and unobtrusive.The one weakness is that there is no light to indicate that the unit is on, therefore it is possible to leave the unit on without knowing it, and run the battery down.  And then there's no way to know if your battery is run-down except by the terrible or non-existent recordings that result.But, overall it is a stylish boundary microphone.  I also like it because it resembles a UFO, or more accurately our domestic military industrial complex's ""ARV - Alien Reproduction Vehicle.""  Enjoy",0

5890,"Review of Sony WM-FX197 Walkman. I've had this product for about a month, and I'm very pleased with it. I work in a store and I thought that there would be a static problem. The reception is quite good and very little static. The volume doesn't go quite as loud as my previous Walkman. The belt clip is a major asset for me. The batteries usually last for about 60hrs. The headphones are more than adequate. I didn't see a need to shell out more money for options that I wouldn't even use anyway.I thought the price was reasonable. It would of been nice if this product came with rechargeable batteries and a charger",0
5891,"Works Great :). I use this on my MacBook. Works flawlessly to hookup a TV via svideo. OSX handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that I use when i have it hooked up. Plug it in and video switches to tv settings, unplug it and its back to normal.

5899,"You need this if you value your data!. I did some research on CDs and DVDs for my job, and I discovered that your average commercial-quality CD or DVD will only hold data for 20 years at most, and much less if they aren't handled with great care.  Data on hard drives will degrade over time as well, so you can't depend on that for long term data storage.  Think photos of your kids here, folks.  Have you backed up your photos lately, and are you sure that backup will still be good in 10 years?These babies are rated to hold data for over 100 years!  They have a special, inert chemical dye, and the reflective layer is 100% pure gold.  Seriously, the layer is thin enough to see through.  The technology has been around for a relatively long time, so it is mature.  I think every DVD burner you can buy supports it, and it has gone through all kinds of tests to prove that it actually works.There are a couple of other companies that second-source the technology, but these are the guys who invented it.  It's easy, it's cheap, and it the longest lasting backup media for your really important data that you can buy.  What's to think about?  Buy it already",0

I've used it to connect an iPod and an iSight to the Firewire800 port on my Powerbook, both work fine. It seems a decent value and I'm happy with it",0

5911,"Easy to use but one minor complaint. I found the docking station to be very easy to use. It's great for recording TV or movies onto your player to watch later and the AVI format allows you to store lots of stuff. You can also set a timer to record TV shows like you would on a traditional VCR or DVR. The recorder even comes with it's own universal remote to use on your cable box or TV (I admit I haven't quite figured it out yet). Also, the station charges your player while you record so it won't die on you in the middle of recording a show. Apparently it will record up to 2 gig before making a new file which means it shouldn't break up your DVDs into more than one file. The station automatically formats protected media into special locked files. My only complaint is that copy protected files can't be played back on a TV or computer which can be annoying if you want to enjoy your saved DVDs on a normal sized screen. And it's tricky to rename those files on the computer because you can't open them to see what's what if they are protected. What does it mean? You aren't going to be able to share the movie watching experience on many files because of the protection. However, it's great for recording for personal use and you can even use it to entertain the kids in the car. I threw a couple of Spongebob's on my player via the station and my son was absorbed for the 40 minute ride to my parents. If you want to get the most out of your player you should buy this product",0

5914,"This is not a color printer yet they don't say it in their marketing and advertise it as a full-function all-in-one. This machine works great except the fact it's not a color printer. I read the whole product description on 5 sites and at least a dozen reviews while comparison shopping for the best price and it was not indicated on any that it is a black and white. The ad says it is full-function printer and I think the color function is an important one. So I'm going to lose a chunk of money (on selling it and the shipping cost) and a bunch of time.I'm more thorough than almost anyone I know.

The Digital ICE 4 suite of apps does a remarkable job of elminating scratches and worn out spots.  It has the slide & 35mm film mount adapters included, comes with Nikon Scan, Nikon View and manuals.  Nikon Scan could be more intuitive, but like all Nikon menus (including their cameras), they think differently than I do at least, so it took me a while to figure out all the different options.  The software found it slightly hard to remember my settings - it was a bit complicated for a scanner, but it is a near-professional scanner, so well .. not much room to complain.  On the whole, this scanner is worth the trouble - holds value well, and gives you excellent scans",0

I've taken local and long distance trips, in car, van and motorhome. Very easy to use right out of the box, easy to see in the motorhome at distances greater then in a car, even with my sixty year old eyes. We live about 30 miles from Fort Worth and occasionally go into the city, we have used it to find banks, stores and places to eat. On a recent trip to Phoenix, AZ the guidance was especially helpful, I really appreciated the early warning to navigate the freeway interchanges, when to get in the left lane for left exit or how far to next change. On the trip it was helpful to find places to eat. On business trip to Houston I find the ETA info helpful to plan meetings. The remote is helpful in the motorhome, but I knocked off one star becouse of funky power cord connection, and no FM modulator.",0
5928,"Does the job for casual performance. I bought this mic because I wanted to make a homemade karaoke system.  A mic, music devocalizer, and nice speakers does the trick.  I couldn't get two mics to work together but I'm working on that.  As for quality, it is somewhat quiet but you can always turn up your volume for that.  Plus, many people don't realize that PCs don't run mic sound through the speakers on default.  You go to the Volume Control Panel for that and check the box Microphone.  The only two problems I see with this are it's sensitivity for bass (even knocking the cord around gets picked up) and that you have to hold it close to your mouth (maybe a result of mediocre uni-directional engineering).  Either way, it works for random fun nights of singing with friends but I doubt people doing real recording would trust this thing",0

I was replacing a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (wireless B).In a nutshell, I followed the instructions to connect the hardware, popped the CD in my ""hard wired"" desktop PC, took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens (which are totally simple to navigate), enabling WEP along the way.  When I was done, I fired up my laptop (which has built in wireless-G card).  Network was detected immediately... all I had to do was type in the WEP key (which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup) and viola!  Connected at 54 Mbps!!Awesome.  The setup procedure could NOT have been any easier.

5935,"iPoddish. My wife opened this from the package for me and the first thing she said is how ""iPoddish"" it seemed for a radio. Strapless, you must pocket this when walking. I wouldn't call this an exercise radio. It's more for travelling, mobility, etc. The internal AM/FM antenna is good for lacking telescopic function of bigger radios. The included earphone speakers far exceeded my expectations. Nothing cheap about them. Another plus: You only need one triple-A battery and this tiny radio, about the size of a lighter, is easy on power. Sleek, high-performing, including 5 presets each for AM/FM/TV, defaulted to shut off after 90 minutes to save batteries, and costing under $39 on Amazon, the DT-180 is a great choice for a ""pocket receiver.",0

It's also a bit on the big side.  I have already recommended this drive to several people",0
5937,"It definitely works... and its cheap. Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value.",0

I would have given it a 5, but I haven't tested ALL the features out yet since just setting it up a couple days ago after my new entertainment center arrived for it to sit on.

There was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. This would only last a second or two. At first I thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them.

5948,"A great receiver. I recently assembled my first stereo component system (having had mostly single piece stereos for the last 35 years). I thought I might find ""suggested systems"" on the web, however, I ended up researching and price comparing for a month or so before my system was completed. Here is what I bought and some comments:1. The receiver is an Onkyo TX8222 with a ""tape monitor function"" which you need to be able to use an Equalizer plus to hear what you are recording. Although it has just 50 watts per channel, I have never had the volume over a third of the way up. The components below are all connected to it. From my research, Onkyo has a very good reputation.2. I already have an 8 year old Pioneer CD File type player which holds 101 CDs. It still works great. If it ever goes, I will probably get another with a larger capacity.3. A Teac W-600R Dual Full-Logic Cassette Combo. It has two tape decks, is reasonably priced and works fine.4. A Panasonic Technics SLBD20D Turntable. I found good reviews and this is a simple but solid turntable.5. SONY SS-MB350H Bookshelf Speakers (These are a Consumer Reports ""Best Buy""). These speakers really are too big for a bookshelf and deliver very nice sound. I have them connected to the ""A"" speaker output of the receiver.6. SONY SA-WM250 100-Watt Active Subwoofer. I like bass and the addition of this subwoofer connected to the ""B"" speaker output of the receiver really enhances the sound.7. A Technical Pro EQ-5150 graphic equalizer. This is a nice unit and lets you fine tune your music. By connecting it through the tape monitoring loop, you can select any input source to your receiver and adjust the sound. This equalizer has 4 inputs labeled DVD, TAPE, TUNER, and AUX. There are two output connections. An equalizer really tops off a system.You also need something to hold all these components. You may want to look at an OSullivan Black TV VCR Stand - 20222. It has glass doors, three drawers, and adjustable shelves. I put my turntable on top and the other components inside. Try to buy it locally since shipping is otherwise prohibitive. I put caster wheels on it for mobility since it is quite heavy. I also cut a thin plywood backing with larger access holes for the back with access covers that attach with Velcro. I painted the plywood black. The wheels and larger access holes are a real life-saver as you connect all your components.For phonograph record storage I bought a Sauder TV/VCR Cart, Black 401082. I had to drill some higher shelf pin holes to accommodate the records. I also cut a plywood back which I painted black (much better than the black cardboard that comes with it) This unit has wheels and is a cheap way to store records.In summary, the above items have really made for a nice system and all the components work well together. The sound is incredible especially compared to the aged single piece system I previously had. My wife noticed the difference right away. I bought several of the components at Amazon and some at other sites when the price was better. The furniture I bought locally.",0

If you are thinking about getting the 512 or bigger i would not recommend it because you will probably find that you simply dont need that much space.  However, if I could do it all over again I would buy the SanDisk which works just as well for half the price",0

5953,"RF Extender Works and Can Save You Money. I really like this RF Extender. I've used it on the H890 remote as well as the new H1000 remote. All I can say is that it really works. You do have to hook it up to your computer and program it separately from your remote. It has its own firmware. It's easy to do though. I haven't encountered any problems yet setting one up. I'm a professional A/V designer and installer. This is the new way to go. I've installed many hardwired remote IR systems in the past by Xantech and Russound. Those systems cost upwards of $125 on there own. Why not pay a little more and get a great universal remote to boot (H890 for around $250). It comes with a power adapter and IR blasters that plug into this unit then stick on the components you want to control. You can use a flashlight to shine on the face of those source components to help you in locating the IR receiver windows on your cable box/receiver/DVD player etc. (look for a round hole or LED shaped device) Anyways, this is a great product in my opinion",0

I considered the Linksys, a Belkin and a Netgear and after reading positive and negative reviews of all of them, defaulted to my standard: buy the cheapest one that'll work. I had quite a time getting the driver to install and that's my major complaint. Maybe that's the fault of Windows 98, who knows. The driver installation process kept hanging up because one or another DLL file was not found. I finally had to do some online research on this and also downloaded the driver and some other software from Linksys. I finally got the drivers installed and the card actually works fine. I would hesitate to recommend this to someone with an old machine who isn't very computer savvy, but it's a cheap solution that worked out okay for my needs",0

I am a two-finger typist so my hope is to use the product to avoid the typing. So far, the product meets my simple expectations: Scan-and-store and scan-to-PC. I have not yet encountered errors in scanned text. Customer service has also been excellent. I placed two calls to Wizcom's tech support and someone got back to me in less than 20 minutes. In both cases, the errors were on my side: First, I thought the installation CD-ROM was defective but it turned out that I had to reboot my PC in order to read the enclosed CD-ROM. I have had this type of problem with other CD-ROM applications. Second, I was unable to scan text to my PC in a notepad file as instructed in the manual. I repeatedly got the message ""Error sending data to PC"" and panicked, thinking that the product was a scam. It turned out the plug to my Pen (not the USB plug to PC) was not fully inserted. Once corrected, it works just as expected. I feel a great relief that I don't have the hassle to return the pen. I am satisfied with the product.",0

I wouldn't want to spend 2 hours punching numbers into a spreadsheet with it, but I'm confident it will perform quite well for my intended purposes. But, I am hoping that it breaks in a bit with use. Also, the flat, ribbon style, retracting cable works like a charm, and it's exactly the size and weight I'd hoped (I'll post a customer picture soon).This thing is going to be great plugged into my laptop at shows, and I'm looking forward to playing my favorite space sim with a joystick in each hand and this thing just in reach without a full keyboard in the way. =",0

Seagate has a reputation of producing good drives.I bought this as a portable ""master drive"" to use among two or more computers.  Why carry more than you have to?I thought that, to save space, I would get a few retractable USB cables to avoid the necessity of always carrying more of a clutter of cables.Surprise!!!  The Seagate uses an extremely special purpose USB cable to connect to its usb receptacle.  None of my other cables will work with it.  Firstly, the receptacle is so far recessed into the drive casing that an ordinary usb cable cannot reach into it.  Secondly, if you cut away some of the plastic surrounding the male end of the cable, it will fit into the receptacle but (Surprise!) it will not work.  Why? I do not know.  I tried several other cables that worked with other drives and devices but none worked with the Seagate.I tried searching for similar cables on the internet but, after searching exhaustively, found nothing.  You have to contact Seagate and buy another of its special purpose cables ($9.25 + tax/shipping each).The pretext of the odd Y shaped cable is that some computers will need a second usb jack for additional power.  Of course, this is rare and it strikes me as simply a profit enhancement dodge.Result: 8% higher cost and more cable clutter",0

Great 360degree turning radius and decent vertical adjustment. The picture quality is OK for most uses like online chat.

5977,"This Product Does Work. I had a rare DVD disc that had developed a tangle of faint cracks, making later tracks unplayable.I used the advice given in an earlier review to use two drops of the repair fluid (aluminum oxide) for the initial cycle and single drops thereafter.  This was good advice and made some improvements, but there was persistent stalling and break-up in some tracks.The unit works by having an electric motor spin two cylinders, each of which rubs an annulus-shaped surface against the CD or DVD. The set comes with each repair surface attached to a flat disc with three prongs, mounted into a clear plastic base.  The buffing surface comes only on its disc-tripod.  To go between repair and buffing, one must use an enclosed small plastic brush-crowbar to pry open the surface between the disc-tripod and the clear plastic base.  This is not mentioned in the instructions.Also not mentioned is that one may buff more than once.  I ended up buffing four times.  This was probably more than necessary.  Sometimes one may put on too much of the repair fluid, which may find itself spread unevenly or left in small clumps.  The result is that areas of the DVD that had played all right before now break up because of irregularities or waves in the fluid coating itself.  My final cycle involved two larger drops, followed by using the repair cycle without putting any extra fluid on.  This may have smoothed the coating without the more severe action a buffing would have given.Now the disc works all right throughout.  There is some loss of picture sharpness, but it's acceptable.Along the way, I sent the customer service rep at Aleratec two e-mails seeking advice.  The responses were fast, courteous, and helpful.The product does work but needs more complete instructions and suggestions.  Skill rises with practice.   Be patient at first.",0

5980,"The Samsung 214T is an Outstanding LCD Monitor. Like one of the earlier reviewers, this is my first LCD monitor and I couldn't be more pleased.  My old monitor was a Mitsubishi flat-screen Diamond 200, and while I'm still satisified with it, the 214T simply blows it away.  At 21.3"" the display seems gigantic and the picture and quality have to be seen, to be believed.  I'm running it under Linux, using an Nvidia GeForce 6200 and its drawing time is incredibly fast.  Thanks to the 8ms gray-to-gray response time, I haven't seen any ghosting or smearing, even when playing Quake.  One caveat though, whether you run this under Linux or Window you'll want to make sure you're running the latest video drivers.  If you're running under Linux make sure your video card supports the 1600x1200 resolution *and* that the card's pixel clock can run at the recommended 162 MHz rate.  Otherwise, you may see the dreaded ghosting etc., (by the way, this is true for any LCD, not just the 214T).In addition, the text quality at the recommended 1600x1200 resolution is superb.  The blacks seem darker than most of the LCD monitors I've seen (likely due to the 900:1 contrast ratio).  I do a lot of writing, so this was important.  If you do a lot of online reading or writing, then this feature will definitely save you eye strain.Finally, I ordered it from TigerDirect (via Amazon of course) and I was very happy with the service.  It arrived a day early, in the original packaging and there were no dead pixels.  I haven't tried the analog connection, but the DVI digital connection works perfectly.  All-in-all, I am very satisfied.  This is one of the few products I own that really deserves the 5-star rating.

I run ~15 degrees celsius cooler, under load, versus the stock AMD hsf combo.Measure the dimensions of the area in your case above and to the sides of your CPU.  This thing is HUGE.  In a full desktop case, I could only install this after completely disassembling the machine, and then cramming everything back together by flexing the motherboard and the heatpipes more than I should have.Not only is the setup wide, it's very tall.  My case cover barely slides over the top of the fan.During installation, follow all of the packagted instructions, except for the step that tells you to remove the backing from the motherboard side of the retaining bracket.

But I also wanted it to cool the room quickly. The ionizer is plus because it also takes care of the smells from the kitchen that carry into this room. The remote is a plus! Easy to assemble, easy to use, has a remote, is quite, and helps with odors",0
5992,"easy to install and no problems. Just installed one on my Dell 4100 running ME.  The driver installation process was the shortest that I have encountered.  It was just a few seconds.  Now, I do not have to crawl under the table to change out USB cables.  Great product.  Ebay's prices seem to be similar to Amazon's",0
5993,"Great item!. This docking station is small, light, and terrific...has many ports and sits behind the notebook, not under it...Was able to plug in my old HP 5M laser printer!",0
5994,Excelente antena wireless. Comprela con confianza que es un excelente producto. Yo he comprado varias para mi uso personal y para varios de mis amigos. Los cuales han quedado satisfechos al igual que yo,0
5995,"Retro Charm, Sturdy, Fully Functional. if you're looking for an old fashioned phone without the dialing action, this one fills the bill. great sound quality, nice weight, good button response, and so far, no glitches. it even has flash & redial buttons cleverly disguised in the center of the keypad. no caller id lcd or phone number memory, but that would really spoil the retro charm. we use an antiquated ameritech caller id machine with it, and the two get along fine",0
5996,"Niccccceee. this thing is nice, i would have gave it 5 stars but when i received it, it had a scratch on it, but i was too lazy to return it. but honestly this is worth the money. the case has scrathes all over but it still looks nice and my ipod still looks ne",0
5997,"Good media, questionable customer service by seller. The DVD+R media is the best for data archiving and error correction and Taiyo Yuden makes the best media so does that mean that Taiyo Yuden is the best of the best?  Maybe, all I know is the media works great in all my drives without any problems with a drive recognizing the media.This review is mainly about the media but I do want to insert a side note. The picture of the DVD+R media shown is inaccurate. The picture shows the media in a cake box spindle and what I received was a tape wrapped spindle with no cover. I contacted the seller and was told that there was an error in the picture but that they would ship out a cake box to me immediately. One month later and I am still waiting. Not a HUGE deal but, I kinda expected the cake box storage and as such I now have to find another way of storing the empty DVD's.Still a great value and a great product",0
5998,"good program can be improved. I have used Microsoft streets and trip, and then I bought this program. In some respect it is better and in other respects it is not. This program was designed for the stand alone gps system where as the Microsoft s&t is a general purpose program with lots of commands and options. The Map system is better in Microsoft, but the guidance system is better with Iguidance. It has 3d views, better voice and better user interface. All in all it is worth buying if you have a laptop or a pda and a gps receiver it gives you a cheaper way to solve your gps problems.I have used Pharos, Holux and Globalsat's Gps receiver. Of the three I like to Globalsats bt-253 the best. It does not lose signals whereas Pharos seems to lose the signals. It may be a little more accurate because of the number of satallites that it can get being a 20 channel one. As far as map accuracy and uptodateness of maps, I really don't know about areas other than mine. It seems to be very uptodate in the Sanfrancisco east bay area",0
5999,"Thinking of Buying Another One!. I'd been using an older model Panasonic Velcroed to my treadmill. It had served the purpose for a while but, as I'd inherited it from my 14-year-old stepson, it had seen better days. It skipped more and more and I never could remember how to operate the hidden controls.I decided to buy a new one and did a lot of research. In the end I agonized over whether I should buy another Panasonic or a Sony. I finally picked this one for a couple of reasons: 1.) I have the matching cassette deck and it has performed flawlessly and 2.) I like being able to see the controls.Well, I've had the S2 for a few weeks now and it is absolutely wonderful. It hasn't skipped even once no matter what kind of CDs I've loaded it with. The controls are easy to use, even when going full-tilt boogie on the treadmill. I highly recommend this puppy. In fact, I'm thinking another one is in my future",0
